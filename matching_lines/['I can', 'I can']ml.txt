['I can', 'I can']

Then I cannot see face value
such as I can see

as far as I can see
I can find a way to block it incoming

I can find a way to block incoming 
I can find a way to block it in the incoming stream

I can find a way to block it
I can’t fix them without direction

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

Then I can’t presume to feed others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

But I can’t let myself disregard
where I can lay claim to ruins

where I can claim to see the ruins
from where I can claim

from where I can claim to see the mosquitos
I can see only values falling back

I can see only the back of falling values
then I can see only the back of values

then I can see only the back values
I can see only the back of their economic value

since I can imagine movement
I can hear it between bills and stuff

that I can hear
all that I can think I want

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I believe I can

I believe I can prepare for it
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I cannot clear it also through investiture
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

but I can hear them
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

I cannot hear it between bills
I can’t remember them

in that I cannot remember 
Having seen more than I can remember 

I have seen more than I can remember
