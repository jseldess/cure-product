into rotating directionless 
into the minority proportion of time
Arrayed out in such a nested way
But that is beside the point

Then I cannot see face value
Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type
off the edge of the world

reasons resources
an impure product
drifting away
Before we walk across the wide field

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
asynchronous 
as pure as my children
I step off the edge

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

What is an impure product
value falling off the edge of the face
I reach repeated expressions first
Before we walk across the wide opening

I propogated repeated expressions first
Put in place as stationary destinations
how can I know without direction
for how can I know without direction

Stationary destination
As though stationary and a destination
The edge isn’t even there
Rather it itself is rotating

And put in place as though stationary
in rotating directionless space
Though there are quarters goals
not rotating

into rotating and directionless space
and then into rotating and directional space
or not even rotating
for how can you know without direction

not even rotating
slow asynchronous
attempted anachronism
but not impart cynicism

as a cure product
as a pure product
I want but not to impart cynicism
others desires

Which is a measure to never live out
as an impure product
drifting away needs others presume desires
If I let myself see others desires

at any time it can drift again
Without a proposed budget
But not to impart cynicism
Then I constellate my time family country

bring your child along
bearing children along
who are so fresh and agile
the drifting is not something special

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
drifting away needs
There are quarterly goals
There are performance reviews

And as an extension of the values
I was enjoined to act again myself
The South Carolina primary 
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

drifting away from the task
in a moment of drifting away from the task
But I can’t let myself disregard
Others desires as legitimate

The value falling off the edge of the face
I’ll pull my data higher up
And make myself a visible
I’ll pull my data

over the long line I would honor
Then the sun isn’t available
I am first in the office
I am told by no ventillation

or available
Which can be pronounced to the world
I’ll get there eventually
So I constellate the time family country

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
soft paper
here described

which can be pronounced 
I want to cite a poem so usual
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I take hold of my finger

with reasons
into a brigand and a murderer
If you have confidence regardless all else
Which can be called confidence

Attributable or
I keep turning back again myself
In a vertiginous dream
I brought my qualities down

in a continuous vertiginous dream
The CEO tells me to embody values
But not to me directly
I spend time online learning to code

dislocated and a person from a distance
Spinning around the heart
Where I put it beating
While I should be sleeping 

You use the most essential parts
Even before the skills aquired
When they really take hold of my finger
That’s when they really take

In a continuous theme
a similar desire against me
an unassimilable desire against me
appendage

Remnant continuous pages
I was enjoined to act again
So I was enjoined to rewind
To that impossible place

hovering above standing water
there was no promotion
On the timeline I was on
The timeline

or an available resource
available
high up in the internet
Booked with a meeting

and invaluable partner
The value falling off the edge of th face
over the long time up in the sky
over the time line I was on

Tomorrow
I see only the back of falling values
blue and sun again a second, then night
The planning process for visions

of my economic value
I see the back of falling values
upsent in the afternoon
I see only the back of my habits

I can see only the back of falling values
I can see only values falling back
out in the snow falling face value
and testing the edge and gravity

The planning process is for visionaries only
of the economic value my habits
of the habits I create
the planning process for decisions

Aspirational strategy
then I can see only the back of values
I am not allowed to see their face
of the economic value

then I can see only the back values
I can see only the back of their economic value
of the habits they create
The strength of the habits

increasingly that their economic value
their economic value
with implicit regulations
in a regulated climate

in front of the set of regulations
with internally regulated climate
into the well controlled climate
I tried to feel the extension of key values

when trying to feel the extension of key values
that their economic value 
of the habits they create.
They are called aspirational

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
and key value
I am bid to act again
off the end myself

I was enjoying acting against myself
I was enjoined to act
I argued the days were longer
off the end of the world

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
aspirating visions
I agrued the days were longer

I am enjoined to act again
I was bid to act again myself
I was big to act again
off the end

with little reason to move
with little reasons to aspiration
embodied aspirations
embodied with little visions

I was enjoined to act against
with little reasons to move
full of aspirations
embodied with little aspirations

The days lined along company
The days of private data
The days of parsing data
That company creates a life

with little reason to aspiration
embodied with little reason
little visions
embodied everyday

As an extension of the values
The days of public data
Life is with people
aspirating with little visions

Running above broadway
If I take a different measure
in traversing my purchase
If I take some different measure

I reuse unassimilable visions
talking into pheasants bending themselves
The long time I had a vision
without the long time I was accounting

there was no walking along the pleasure
promoting from home to a new job
I had me a vision
there was no walking along

promoting from home
no solid ground to continue along
where you can earn more 
and continue along having 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
walking along the measure
walking from home along the measure
there wasn’t any television 

I resume unassimilable visions
up in the television pleasure
until I could not tire 
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
black spots on a white surface
white spots on a black surface

the simple act of honoring an accountant
of honoring surmounted
the simple act of opening surmounted
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
I resume attributable visions
You can hear it also through static leisure
wrapped in static

Toward the start informally given my reasons
the opacity given to them
but where is it
only in the case

without ensuing damage
attributable visions
after having been contented
attributable decisions

visions that can be attributable
that can be attributable
decisions that can be attributable
having been graspable

of attributable visions
a futile joyous white sun
I shivered looking up
As a clone, illegally conceived

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I came after my past
having been an ungraspable time

Articles all around us
articles all around storming around
 and juice
We had to say goodbye there

around the dogs and lillies
I spin around
I came back to me
I captured an afterimage

I let it remind me again
while consuming damage
where I need gravity
And for an ungraspable time

around 
I spun around trying to touch the spots
There are spots waiting
until I purchase up in the sky

without consumer damage
without longer damage
so that nothing had gravity
My means without gravity

without any further damage
to any consumer damage
I capture an afterimage
until the bill came

without any longer damage
some sort of a futile joyous white sun
Not even a [blank] would elect to be
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses

to ask in advance
and other types of tracking technology
was not just a defeat
though it was most emphatically that

More reasons around my country 
which we can pronounce
I send and retrieve the impulse
But my not feeling the memory aside

trackers collecting data on users
data collection on users
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
They have very many choices

More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
I have entered my phone
elsewhere my purposes

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
from no one point
where I am aside at least
for the duration of the answer

for the duration of the universe
burrowed about from repeated travels
answered about 
from cables reheated travels

the duration of answers
for the duration of answers
where I blend and relive
The ends of my transactions

and around redundant
which had on honor to be told
for not paying redundant
for not paying sound overwhelmed

and literally moved about
I presume to others
in need one in that best own
need one in best own

that stays brought loyal
about the site
about the site hosting
by the sight of the hosting answered about

I answered about
which I feel formerly about for
not literally moved about
washed I answered about

formerly along time they were on
own stays brought loyal
decisioned to learn 
I ask say in that case

that decisions can be attributable
converting sight into a purchase
the way was water
with her waves

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
and stand and retrieve and pulse around
Though we can’t help waiting
to the ends of my transactions

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
Who throws contours away
Formerly a way like this one
It’s not marshall exactly

Formerly away there are constant ways
formerly away
But my not feeling the memory inside
and have no way

drawn formerly a long time

along cables

increased

mostly along cables
the least productive of myself
the least instructive of myself
where I am aside

at least for the duration of the answer
my interfaced stand data
in data
By my memory elsewhere

my standing in data
I answered what I thought about
stopped light with validated fields
in the long time they were on

shone formerly along time
formerly along the time they were on
My say to the elections
That are my right to say

between cereal and economic
my ethereal economic relations
 as points which are my interest 
in welfare and hope

behind or out front or up above
waiting out front or up above 
I returned not sad exactly
in the space out front

waiting out front or up above or behind
I learned my location
sung reflexing
and advantaged irretrievably

I returned to location
I learned my approval
rendered approximately
I learned my approximate point

into an own
into an oral
the young ripples inaudibly
I have them lost

and could be inflected with reasons
that agreed to one the people
the people in home form
posterity

own best form to ourselves
home stays brought loyal
the people in own form
the people in form own

home rest form to ourselves 
own stays bought loyal
inure tranquility
We ask say in that case

revisions that can be attributable
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
I have seen more than I can remember
in that decisions can be attributable

I assume possession to others
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
I assume the offers reliable
in that I cannot remember
