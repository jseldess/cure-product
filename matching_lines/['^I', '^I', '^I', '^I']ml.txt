I am to end my connections suspended live
I intend my connections
I suspend live connections to you
I upend my connections to you

I upend live connections to you
I intend my connections to you
I suspend my connections to you
I step off the edge

I assumed it was visible
I intend my live connections to you
I’ll pull myself another personality type
I’ll get there eventually

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
I told her a story, she drew waves.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
I have entered my phone

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
In a sharp downard turn
I shake violently 
I reach repeated expressions first

In the retroactive light
It keeps coming down thankfully
In the light of retroactive conversations
In the light of retroactive

I want to find a way to block it incoming
I propogated repeated expressions first
I want to find a way to block it
I want to find a way to block incoming

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
I can find a way to block it incoming
I can find a way to block incoming 
I can find a way to block it in the incoming stream

I can find a way to block it
I’m simply inside
I can’t fix them without direction
I step over the edge

If I step on the edge
If I step over the edge
I want but not to impart cynicism
If I let myself see others desires

I let myself treat
In the right sense
I am first in the office 
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

I was enjoined to act again myself
It has been since
I’ll pull my data higher up
I’ll pull my data

I’ll pull myself higher up
I am told ventillation
I am the first in the office
I am told by no ventillation

If he had not carried one virtue
I want to cite a poem so usual
I take hold of my finger
I constellate the time

I want to cite a poem
If you have confidence regardless all else
Interrupted sleep or
I would like your zip code

In a vertiginous dream
I keep turning back again myself
I brought my head down
I brought my qualities down

I spend time online learning to code
I search with my head
In a continuous theme
I logged in

I put my bread down
I brought my count down
I put my head down
I wish my desires were open

I keep turning back
I log in and search with my head
I was advised to rewind
I was enjoined to act again

I’ll get there ruins
I had me a vision
I hear it between bills and stuff
I am told by the ventillation

I am learning to code
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
It’s morning 
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Its strategy comes before morning goals
It’s the third letter from the end
I just got a letter
I see only the back of falling values

I see only the back
I see the back of the planning process
I see the back of falling values
I can see only values falling back

I see only the back of my habits
I can see only the back of falling values
I tried to feel the key values extending 
I argued the days felt longer

I am not allowed to see their face
I can see only the back of their economic value
I tried to feel the extension of key values
I am bid to act again

I argued the days were longer
I was enjoying acting against myself
I was enjoined to act
I agrued the days were longer

I am enjoined to act again
I was bid to act again myself
I was big to act again
I am full of potential

I argued that the days were longer
I was enjoined to act against
I invited most of what came next
I had nightmares though

I aspirate with little vision
In my sight 
I had to tell them the news
I can hear it between bills and stuff

I love my daughter still
If I take a different measure
If I take some different measure
I reuse unassimilable visions

I take it out in the snow fall
I resume unassimilable visions
I reuse indelible tracks 
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I believe I can
I even know what I would find
I believe I can prepare for it
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
I refuse indelible tracts
I refuse indelible tracks
I refuse indelible contracts

I need the work
I resume indelible tracks
I cannot clear it also through investiture
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I need an explicit statement
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
I cannot hear it between bills

I resume attributable visions
I walk up and don’t work anymore
I had a vision
I enter the flattening mirror

I like sleep
I watch a movie
I get through there
I could in effect credit

I could effect credit
I have them lost
I have them trust in me
I swayed a little in my state

I get from here through there
I get here through there
I came back to me
I captured an afterimage

I watch a moving afterimage
I came after my past
In conversing of my purpose
I continue to presume

I continue to subsume
I continue to consume
I shivered looking up
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

I could consume the dream
If articles can storm in excess
I tell you my purposes
I have supporters

I tell you the weight of my purchases
I wear suspenders
I spin around
I let it remind me again

I used my technology
I continued to dream then
I designed them to hold up my underwear
I spun around trying to touch the spots

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I click or my zipcode
I tell you the weight of my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity

Is the weight of my purchases
Is the weight of my click or zipcode
I capture an afterimage
I thought

I have a memory between the day
I designated 
I assumed 
I envy honesty	

I have entered my purposes
I have entered my purchases
I send and retrieve the impulse
I stand and retrieve the impulse

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
I though
I send and retrieve aside the impuse
I stand and retrieve the impuse

I speak to them
I stand and retrieve the impulse around
I am requesting my point
I move

I literally moved
I speak to them my possessions
I literally move them
I speak them of my possessions

I presume to others
I ask say in that case
I answered about
In my heart did I lose trust

In what part did I lose trust
I end up in Bach 
I ask say in that phase decisioned
I end up in Bach and Selma

It’s not marshal exactly
I end up Bach
Is there a baby and a bear
I have turned it off

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
I stand and retrieve and pulse around
It’s not marshall exactly
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

I end up Bach forty-one seconds in
I end up in Bach with no way 
I end up 44 seconds in
I answered what I thought

I assumed what I draw
I turn not sad exactly
I had entered my phone
I interfaced

I answered while interfaced
I answered what I thought about
I return not sad exactly
I stay the right of my elections

I stay the right of my possessions 
I returned not sad exactly
I learned my location
I returned to location

I learned my point
I learned the point where I am
I learned the point of standing
I learned my approval

I learned my approximate point
I returned
I can’t remember them
I assume the offers reliable

I assume the offers revisitable
I assume the offers divisible
I presume the offers
I offer to you

I resume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home
I resume at home
I only think I don’t listen

I have seen more than I can remember
I assumed that they were divisible
I assume possession to others
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
