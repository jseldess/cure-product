['^[o|O]n\\s', '^[o|O]n\\s']

On a snow day with my children
on a snow day with my children

on a day there will be direction
On a day there will be direction

on the time line I was on
On the bandwidth I was on

On the timeline I was on
On the other hand

on behalf of imagined
on my way to elections

on Bach
on the other end

on a way to the elections
