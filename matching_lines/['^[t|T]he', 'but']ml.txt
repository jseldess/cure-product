The dogs and lillies
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
but not impart cynicism

The sun isn’t up
I want but not to impart cynicism

Then fall then summer
Attributable or

Then I cannot see face value
but the sun isn’t up

The third letter from the end is mine
but it continued

The entire company
but it continued rippling muscle

The days were long aligned
but would I love her the same

The long time I had a vision
but they are black spots

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
but I can hear them

there was no television to hear
I resume attributable visions

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
but where is it

Then I saw into you
attributable visions

Then I continue to dream then
that decisions can be attributable

the way was water
but for memory elsewhere

They were filters
but standing in memory

the right of my elections
decisions that can be attributable

The prospects there already
revisions that can be attributable

the prospects being seen by me
but I own all that’s messageable

The prospect for careening attached
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

The sun high enough to strike directly
