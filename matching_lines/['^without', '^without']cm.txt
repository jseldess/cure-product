['^without', '^without']

without imparting the cynicism
without the long time I was accounting

without the long time I was on accounting
without accounting the long time I was on

without accounting for credit
without ensuing damage

without consumer damage
without longer damage

without any further damage
without any longer damage

without really agreeing
without really speaking

without really breaking
without really branding 

without really binding myself
without really binding

without their agreement
without really needing
