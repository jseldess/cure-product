Ask who I am to suspend

I am to end my connections suspended live
Arrayed out in such a nested way

But that is beside the point
Where I sleep at times

You should ask who I am
Whereas direction is beside the point

into the stream of pictures

Ask who I am
We’ll have coffee this morning

Ask who I am to end my live connection

So I find myself at home

Then I cannot see face value

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

On a snow day with my children
Before we walk across the wide field

I’ll get there eventually

Then I constellate my time family country

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

I told her a story, she drew waves.
So I went back to sleep

because it was really dark
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

What is an impure product

it was really sunny
too sunny to eat ice cream

Then fall then summer from my face
not calling or echoing for once

I have entered my phone
Before we walk across the wide opening

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
who knows the way

stopped light with validated variegated fields
battery dawn nights blending themselves

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
In a sharp downard turn

I shake violently 
and not falling at all

Falling from this distance
Falling from my face

Face falling off the edge of the face
value falling off the edge of the face

about my children’s consumption
Then fall then summer

I reach repeated expressions first
In the retroactive light

I shake violently
of retroactive observations

such as I see
such as I can see

It keeps coming down thankfully
In the light of retroactive conversations

conversations with our purchase
as far as I can see

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
In the light of retroactive

conversations with our reactions
In the light of retroactive 

conversations with our feelings
Of course there is a direction

When I want something
before we can have a retroactive

conversation with our feelings
in light of learning what we see

I want to find a way to block it incoming
I propogated repeated expressions first

Before anyone buys up the opening
I want to find a way to block it

skin smile repeated expressions
I want to find a way to block incoming

smile testing glance repeated expressions
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

I can find a way to block it incoming
One day there is direction

interjecting on a day ambition
Before anyone walks across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the opening
I can find a way to block incoming 

I can find a way to block it in the incoming stream
than in the incoming stream

I can find a way to block it
That’s exaclty what I want for them

Before anyone has walked across the field
from the incoming stream

as long as I have access to the code
or the incoming stream

and at my desk
love of breadth

especially in a child
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

only fragments of time with my children
on a day there will be direction

interjecting into the stream
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

interjecting into the stream of pictures
One day was actually

Though there are quarters goals
Actually one day there is direction

Though there are quarters goals 
Put in place as stationary destinations

how can I know without direction
for how can I know without direction

The edge is put in place
Stationary destination

That is itself not still
As though stationary and a destination

Rather it itself is rotating
And put in place as though stationary

in rotating directionless space
wrestling to stay still

not rotating
wrestling me to stay still

russling to stay still
I can’t fix them without direction

there are quarters 
We can wrestle them with their goals

We can rest there in them with their goals
into rotating and directionless space

with goals
Though how can you know without direction

With goals

with goals I find there

You can hear it also through your leisure
Which is a measure to never live out

But I can’t let myself treat 

Then I can’t presume to need others

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
at any time it can drift again

I let myself treat

I was bid to act again myself
I was big to act again

Since I had to hold the entire company
My associations

or argued for them at least
The days aligned for company

since I can imagine movement
I am full of potential

with full potential to movement
since you can imagine movement

The days are long

The days were long

There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer

I was enjoined to act against

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

I had nightmares though

I had a vision
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

Under the last principle of purchasing power

And we had to say goodbye to her there

For an ungraspable time

Under the past prinicple
We had to say goodbye there

If articles can storm in excess

And need out in front purchase

Under the last principle
And read out in front

And from a weak distance

where I need gravity
And for an ungraspable time

they can be waived
I have supporters

I tell you the weight of my purchases

And from that great distance

around the dogs and lillies

I spin around 

I let it remind me again
Where I lead gravity

while consuming damage
I continued to dream then

until I purchase up the sky
designed to hold up my underwear

I designed them to hold up my underwear
having supporters 

that hold and wish to hold
And from a great distance

until I purchase the sky
all the spots

to catch the spots
I spun around trying to touch the spots

There are spots waiting
until my purchase up in the sky

They can be weighed
One was up where it should be down

I tell you where I need gravity
Is the weight of my purchases

without consumer damage
that nothing had gravity

My means without gravity
I capture an afterimage

without longer damage
so that nothing had gravity

That I captured an afterimage
without any further damage

Bach helps turn it off

Selma helps too
with her way to the ends

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
Though we can’t help waiting

Though we can’t help waiting for her
Is there a baby and a bear

My daughter helps too
My daughter turns it off too

He has turned it off
I have turned it off

formerly a way
battery dawn nights 

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
to the other end of actions

actions
to the other end battery dawn 

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
battery dawn 

Who throws contours away
It’s not marshall exactly

with no way
of my actions

who throws contours a way
who throws a constant way

There are constant ways
The other end of means

Formerly away there are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
with no constant way

The contours exchange with you
with no constant ways 

who know the ways to their other end
The many transparent pixel calls

who know the way to their other end
The many transparent pixels call

of the many transparent pixel calls
calls

with no constant waves
There are no constant waves

The other ends of my transactions
There are no constant ways

The other end of my transactions
To the other end of transactions

and end up in Bach
To the other end of my actions

To the other end of transactions like this
and have no way

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
the other end of actions

Like this one other end of transactions
To the other end of means like this one

Like this one the other end of means
with constant ways

formerly away
battery dawn nights

way I was going 
I end up Bach forty-one seconds in

with constant ways to the other end
A way I was going

I end up in Bach with no way 
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

on Bach
formerly my way 

I answered what I thought
shone formerly a long time

formerly my way to the elections
on a way to the elections

formally a way to the elections
formerly along my say to the elections

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
drawn formerly a long time

drawn formerly along 
formerly a long time

I assumed what I draw
which as 

stopped light with validated faces
where I’m watching my tv

But my feeling the memory aside
along cables

in my increased capacity
increased

where I am aside increased
where I am decided least

mostly along cables
at least most days

the least productive of myself
the least instructive of myself

at least instructive of myself
at least for the duration of the answer

recalling aside
joined in my wasting vision

Selma’s squirrel and chickadee
also didn’t really move

joined me in wasting my vision
my daughter’s squirrel and chickadee joined me

my interfaced stand data
in data

I turn not sad exactly
I had entered my phone

battery dawn nights ending themselves
radiating from housing

and persisting and replicating
I interfaced

my standing in data
I answered while interfaced

by my standing
addition were filters formerly

I answered what I thought about
but standing in memory

shone formerly along time
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

drawn formerly rights blended themselves
dawn formerly nights ended themselves

drawn formerly rights
drawn formerly rights ended themselves

formerly along the time they were on
My say to the elections

That are my right to say
Cereal and others’ health

wealth and the pace of digestion
between cereal and economic

my ethereal economic relations
about 

 as points which are my interest 
in welfare and hope

iced coffee and sun position
I return not sad exactly

not literally moved
I stay the right of my elections

aligned or not with my interests
stay to my elections

to the right of a surcharge
abjure them with determining 

I stay the right of my possessions 
I returned not sad exactly

to return what I bought
in the fill space 

behind or out front or up above
or imagined anyway

to the right marking
in the fill space

waiting out front or up above 
in the space out front

waiting out front or up above or behind
in the fill space out front

I learned my location
the right of surcharge

and advantaged irretrievably
at the site of a purchase

I returned to location
as the right of a surcharge

I learned my point
I learned the point where I am

I learned the point of standing
I learned my approval

rendered approximately
I learned my approximate point

requesting my standing
the right of a surcharge

I can’t remember them
passwords 

reflexing indented in my moan
that their knowing

in my state
state reflexing indented in my own

state kept moaned impression
My state kept loaned impression

The weight kept moaned impression
state indented in my own

devoid kept moaned reflexing
and advantaged

into liminal reflexing
into an own

the tongue and hands
into an oral

the young ripples inaudibly
indented into an own

state kept owned impression
Choose a line

buy in the sound privacy
phrase them of our possessions

phrase them
that agreed home

I assume the offers reliable
and maybe regrettable 

in that I cannot remember 
I assume the offers revisitable

revisable
I assume the offers divisible

that they were visible
and came home to rewind inflections

and could be inflected with reasons
and came home to rewind

before I act on them
which is not necessarily possible

that agreed to one the people
that agreed one best

home stays brought loyal
and our 

inure tranquility
that agreed home to people

own stays bought loyal
bought stays own loyal

bills and stuffed animals
visions that can be attainable

advised to be retainable
revisions that can be attributable

revised to be attainable
between the private ambles

if only on the way to the trash
So I found myself at home

The offers there already
at home brought into private

The prospect of seeing healthily 
between the preambles

So I resume the offers already
at home visions can be attainable

that this is possible
for a while to listen already

So I presume the offers at home already
brought messageable into privacy

brought into private messageably
I resume the offers at home already

brought into privacy
for a while to listen 

I resume the offers at home
in privacy that is messageable

I resume at home
for a while not to listen

presume the offers at 
in that all this in private is messageable

For a while I think I don’t listen
All that I own messageable

but I own all that’s messageable
traffick is there nonetheless

careening between the preambles
The prospect for careening attached

The prospect for careening healthily
The prospect for seeing healthily

between the preamble
The prospect for veering healthily

The prospect for steering healthily
between the preambles 

that catch
forgettable

that they were divisible
Having seen more than I can remember 

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
I have seen more than I can remember

in that decisions can be attributable
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

in that possessive
Or can have seen offering possession

and can see offering
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

I assumed that they were divisible
stopping off in all directions

and come home to remind inflections
seen having or offering possession

can have seen offering possession
You can have seen offering

I assume possession to others
in school and can see offering

and maybe forgettable
revisital
