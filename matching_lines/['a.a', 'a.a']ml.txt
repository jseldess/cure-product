Then blue and sun again a second, then night
drifting away

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

attempted anachronism
drifting away needs others presume desires

at any time it can drift again
drifting away needs

I was enjoined to act again myself
drifting away from the task

in a moment of drifting away from the task
I’ll pull my data higher up

I’ll pull my data
Then the sun isn’t available

or available
I keep turning back again myself

a similar desire against me
an unassimilable desire against me

I was enjoined to act again
or an available resource

available
blue and sun again a second, then night

I am bid to act again
I was enjoying acting against myself

I am enjoined to act again
I was bid to act again myself

I was big to act again
I was enjoined to act against

The days of private data
The days of parsing data

The days of public data
talking into pheasants bending themselves

without ensuing damage
I let it remind me again

while consuming damage
without consumer damage

without longer damage
without any further damage

to any consumer damage
without any longer damage

Who throws contours away

Formerly away there are constant ways
formerly away

in my increased capacity
my interfaced stand data

in data
my standing in data
