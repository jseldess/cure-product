by the private preambles
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

interjecting on a day ambition
I keep turning back again myself

white spots on a black surface
because there was no solid ground to continue along

– Macbeth
as far back as my history heard

in the simple act of opening a book
for to tire as far back as my history

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
I came back to me

A baby and a bear
decisioned to learn back

Is there a baby and a bear
