['act', 't$']

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light

In the retroactive light
What is an impure product

In the light of retroactive
I reach repeated expressions first

before we can have a retroactive
I propogated repeated expressions first

One day was actually
as a cure product

I was enjoined to act again myself
I let myself treat

I was enjoined to act again
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

and strategies not tactics
I was enjoined to act

I am bid to act again
or argued for them at least

There was very little physical activity
I was enjoined to act against

I was enjoying acting against myself
since I can imagine movement

actually considering the end
all that I can think I want

I refuse indelible contracts
I need an explicit statement

Though in not many acts
not the simple act

Though it is not a simple act
the simple act of honoring an accountant

the simple act of opening surmounted
in the simple act of opening an accountant

we had inhabited actually
I thought

to the ends of my transactions
Where in me did I host

The ends of my transactions
from no one point

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
in the form filled offered in trust

To the ends of transactions
converting sight

to the ends of actions
I answered what I thought

I turn not sad exactly
not literally moved about

I return not sad exactly
to return what I bought

I returned not sad exactly
out front

before I act on them
that agreed one best
