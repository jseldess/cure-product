['and', '^and', 'or', '^or']

The dogs and lillies
and not falling at all
Before we walk across the wide opening
or the incoming stream

and at my desk
and then into rotating and directional space
or not even rotating
or currents of air

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
and invaluable partner
to be before the sun
or available

into a brigand and a murderer
and my heart rate
off the edge of the world
or an available resource

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
and email
Tomorrow
or argued for them at least

I hear it between bills and stuff
and continue along having 
and support digestion
or in some imaginary elsewhere

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
and hold and wish to hold
missing words 
or alter of course the time anyway

and to which I’ve agreed
and literally moved
I have a memory between the day
or imagined anyway

and advantaged irretrievably
and advantaged
into an oral
