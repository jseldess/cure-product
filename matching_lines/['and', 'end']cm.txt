['and', 'end']

The dogs and lillies
I upend my connections to you

between bills and stuffed animals
battery dawn nights blending themselves

and not falling at all
I spend time online learning to code

dislocated and a person from a distance
appendage

I log in and search with my head
It’s the third letter from the end

blue and sun again a second, then night
I tried to feel the key values extending 

and testing the edge and gravity
off the end of the world

and key value
off the end myself

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
off the end

I hear it between bills and stuff
falling off the encoded end

I can hear it between bills and stuff
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I can hear them between bills and stuff
eroded off the end

On the other hand
talking into percents bending themselves

and hold and wish to hold
I wear suspenders

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
suspenders

that hold and wish to hold
to the ends of my transactions

and to which I’ve agreed
I send and retrieve the impulse

I stand and retrieve the impulse
where I send and relive aside

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
where I end

where I send and retrieve aside
where I send and relive would be held

where I stand and relive
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

Where I send and relive aside
The ends of my transactions

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
where I send and relive

where I stand aside
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

and it doesn’t take long
where I send and retrieve relive

and relive from burrowed travels
where I end and relive

firing and connecting somewhere
where I send and receive

where I blend and relive
the ends of my transactions

and move them literally with me
To the ends of transactions

between tracked and buffered
to the ends of actions

A baby and a bear
I end up in Bach 

I end up in Bach and Selma
to the ends

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
I end up in Bach

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
with her way to the ends

Is there a baby and a bear
to the other end

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
the other end transactions

and end up in Bach
To the other end of my actions

and have no way
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

tracked between buffered and sizes
battery dawn nights ending themselves

and persisting and replicating
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

Cereal and others’ health
rendered approximately

requesting my standing
