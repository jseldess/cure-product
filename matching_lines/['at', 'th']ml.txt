But that is beside the point
Whereas direction is beside the point

Where I sleep at times
I step off the edge

into rotating directionless 
into the stream of pictures

at home brought into privacy
The prospects there already

by the private preambles
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

variegated reflected light
I’ll get there eventually

Then I constellate my time family country
On a snow day with my children

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i
on a snow day with my children

too sunny to eat ice cream
Then fall then summer from my face

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
who knows the way

stopped light with validated variegated fields
battery dawn nights blending themselves

and not falling at all
Falling from this distance

I reach repeated expressions first
Before we walk across the wide opening

of retroactive observations
It keeps coming down thankfully

In the light of retroactive conversations
conversations with our purchase

What is an impure product
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

conversations with our reactions
Then fall then summer

conversations with our feelings
Of course there is a direction

conversation with our feelings
Before anyone buys up the opening

skin smile repeated expressions
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

That’s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field

and at my desk
love of breadth

Put in place as stationary destinations
how can I know without direction

Stationary destination
As though stationary and a destination

Rather it itself is rotating
And put in place as though stationary

in rotating directionless space
Though there are quarters goals

not rotating
I can’t fix them without direction

into rotating and directionless space
there are quarters 

and then into rotating and directional space
for how can you know without direction

not even rotating
what I find there

attempted anachronism
others desires

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

where I sleep at times
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to treat others
In the right sense

What Whitman
Without imparting cynicism 

What does it mean to drift
the drifting is not something special

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
the latter

at any time it can drift again
to the down arrow

That’s where I sleep at times
to the pillow

I let myself treat
Others desires as legitimate

executive breath
execute breath

So I constellate the time family country
The South Carolina primary 

I’ll pull my data higher up
higher up in the internet

I am told ventillation
on the time line I was on

by no ventillation my purpose
I am the first in the office

I am told by no ventillation
over the long line up in the sky

though it was most emphatically that
I constellate the time

When we had jobs that were to earn
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

when we had jobs that was to churn some bread
Which can be pronounced to the world

attesting this is a chance
only in the case

was not just a defeat
 and time in the train

and my heart rate
off the edge of the world

Where official policy is to catch and release
A turtle fished out of the lake

of later results
Then the sun isn’t up

of later ruins
Out of the remnant ruins

and my heartrate
Out of the back page ruins

Where I put it beating
Out of the remnants 

of later pages
Out of the remnants of later pages

Out of the remnant pages of later ruins
Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture

dislocated and a person from a distance
Spinning around the heart

That’s when they really take
with my head

hold at intervals riding forward
which I brought down with qualities

path
not back in the results

at intervals while riding forward
In a continuous theme

To that impossible place
Higher up in the results

out of later results
I’ll get there ruins

Out of later results
I’ll get there ruins 

of later pages ruins results
Out of the remnant pages

hovering above standing water
high up in the architecture

emerging this year from standing water
to see the ruins

emerging this year from too much standing water
to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water

to see the patterns on the birds
to see the sunrise

I’ll pull my data
high up in the internet

I am told by the ventillation
So I am told by the ventillation

So that I notice I am the only one
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

Strategy comes before morning
that having been after content

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning
but the sun isn’t up

Strategy comes before goals
out in the snow

What the next step
I see only the back

of the habits I create
upsent in the afternoon

What’s the next step
I see only the back of my habits

Aspirational strategy
I can see only the back of falling values

of the habits they create
I can see only the back of their economic value

That you can see only the back of
then I can see only the back values

they create
increasingly that their economic value

That can’t be glimpsed
in front of the set afternoon

that can’t be glimpsed
their economic value

with implicit regulations
in front of the set of regulations

with internally regulated climate
I tried to feel the key values extending 

into the well controlled climate
I tried to feel the extension of key values

that their economic value 
is a function of the strength 

of the habits they create.
oddly grown over with historic bark

They are called aspirational
your bid to the next highest ranked network

and strategies not tactics
there was no promotion

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I argued the days felt longer

in a regulated climate
off the end myself

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
And as an extension of the values

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
I agrued the days were longer

when watching tv
off the end of the world

aspirating with visions
off the end

My associations
or argued for them at least

I argued that the days were longer
with little reasons to aspiration

embodied aspirations
with little reason to move

I invited most of what came next
I had nightmares though

that I was the arm of this
with full potential to movement

my associations
with little reasons to move

full of aspirations
embodied with little aspirations

The days of private data
Life is with people

aspirating with little visions
I aspirate with little vision

with little reason to aspiration
embodied with little reason

that potential is there for you
across the retinas

That company creates a life
So stay with us

What I do in my liesure
talking into pheasants bending themselves

What would I feel without that goal
What would I feel without a goal

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
– Macbeth

that I can hear
falling off the encoded end

all that I can think I want
without the long time I was accounting

What was the last time
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I even know what I would find
will not be the same

that I hear without trying
falling off the end

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

All that I can think I want
On the other hand

explicit statements
up in the television pleasure

wrapped in static and explicit statements
I cannot clear it also through investiture

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
though as for conversing

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in the simple act of reading

Can I clear it through emphatic seizure
though it is not a simple act

You can clear it also through static seizure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
in the simple act of opening a book

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
You can clear it also through static siezure

You can hear it also through static leisure
You can clear it also through static leisure

I resume attributable visions
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

while wrapped in static
You can hear it also through your leisure

I need an explicit statement
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

it was not just a defeat
advancing the time

for an explicit state
until I purpose the horizon

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
talking into percents bending themselves

like flattening sleep 
which is the long time I was on

like state mirror
I enter the flattening mirror

in the sense of watching
in the sense of sleep

I watch a movie
I get through there

always watching
which is all the time

I swayed a little in my state
in the long time they were on

that will spur me on
in pursuit of the sight

that will try me on 
I get from here through there

I watch a moving afterimage
without ensuing damage

attributable visions
visions that can be attributable

that can be attributable
decisions that can be attributable

of attributable visions
I get here through there

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
here is the site of the battle of maldon

that I saw
Under the grasp principle

of those gathered
Up in the sky

 of those gathered
She lay under the grass

And from that great distance
around the dogs and lillies

that hold and wish to hold
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

And from a great distance
While we’re up in the sky

to catch the spots
I spun around trying to touch the spots

that nothing had gravity
My means without gravity

so that nothing had gravity
without longer damage

That I captured an afterimage
without consumer damage

that of the man with the dyed blond hair
full of the missing words

between that day
I thought

I designated 
in the space that it had

if that has anything
I have a memory between the day

designated 
in the face that I had

The way that she is going
A way formerly like this one

though we are breaking in the space that it had
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

sound inundated for my own purchases
I stand and retrieve the impulse

and found inundated
I send and retrieve the impulse

and drowned inundated
I speak to them

where I am aside at least
for the duration of the answer

for the creation of the universe
for the duration of the universe

burrowed about from repeated travels
deep into pathways from repeated travels

the duration of answers
But my not feeling the memory aside

for the duration of answers
with latency from constituents

only with the latency 
with the latency last night

with a latency last night
knowing the constituents

and latency found
the opinions in my world

latency which doesn’t mean anything
the resemblance

uses for the attention of the brand
to the suggestion

that is by possessed
that is of I am possessed

that is by I am possessed
I speak them of my possessions

that agreed one of rest
in need one in that best own

own that stays brought loyal
that in need one best own

that stays brought loyal
I ask say in that case

When I'm watching my tv 
and that man comes on to tell me 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

what literally moved
in the face that it had

which is what feels most comfortable
in the form filled offered in trust

so still watch them
in the form filled offered trust

stopped light with validated fields
so still them

In what part did I lose trust
To the ends of transactions

the way was water
to the ends of transactions

speech that is of by prospects
by in the sound privacy

we ask say in that case
by in the sounded privacy

I ask say in that case 
I ask say in that phase decisioned

that decisions can be attributable
with her waves

The way that I am going
But my not feeling the memory inside

The way that I was going
with her way

the way that I was going
to the ends of my transactions

battery dawn nights 
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

to the other end battery dawn 
the other end transactions

battery dawn 
Who throws contours away

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
with no constant way

battery dawn nights
with constant ways to the other end

I answered what I thought
formerly my way to the elections

I assumed what I draw
formerly along time they were on

stopped light with validated faces
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

from cables reheated travels
But my feeling the memory aside

at least most days
the least productive of myself

where I’m watching my tv
at least for the duration of the answer

my interfaced stand data
Aligned or not with my interests

battery dawn nights ending themselves
shone from the housing

my standing in data
I answered what I thought about

That are my right to say
the right of my elections

my ethereal economic relations
I stay the right of my elections

to return what I bought
the right of possessions

I learned my location
the right of surcharge

at the site of a purchase
as the right of a surcharge

rendered approximately
I have them lost

I returned to location
I can’t remember them

that their knowing
the tongue and hands

state kept owned impression
We ask say in that case

that agreed home
phrase them

in that I cannot remember 
I assume the offers revisitable

that they were visible
and could be inflected with reasons

So I find myself at home
buy in the sound privacy

that agreed to one the people
that agreed one best

that agreed home to people
the people in own form

visions that can be attainable
I presume the offers

revisions that can be attributable
So I presume the offers already

between the private ambles
the prospects there already

So I found myself at home
the prospects being seen by me

at home brought into private
The prospect of seeing healthily 

at home visions can be attainable
that this is possible

So I presume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home
in privacy that is messageable

I resume at home
presume the offers at 

in that all this in private is messageable
For a while I think I don’t listen

All that I own messageable
but I own all that’s messageable

The prospect for careening attached
between the preambles

that catch
stepping in the middle

that they were divisible
stopping in the middle

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
I have seen more than I can remember

in that decisions can be attributable
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

in that possessive
I presume to others

I assumed that they were divisible
stepping off into the middle
