['au', 'ou', 'th', 'sh']

because it was really dark
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
In a sharp downard turn

I love my daughter still
but would I love her the same
talking into pheasants bending themselves
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

hauling off the end of the world
without the long time I was accounting
What was the last time
and hold and wish to hold

with my daughter
though we are waiting for her
I thought
The way that she is going

My daughter helps too
Though we are waiting for her
the way that I was going
It’s not marshal exactly

my daughter will learn 
buy in the surrounded privacy
bought in the sounded privacy
shone from the housing

the young ripples inaudibly
buy in the sound privacy
phrase them of our possessions
if only on the way to the trash
