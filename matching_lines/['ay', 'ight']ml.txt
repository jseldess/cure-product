['ay', 'ight']

Arrayed
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

On a snow day with my children
variegated reflected light

drifting away
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

who knows the way
stopped light with validated variegated fields

I want to find a way to block it incoming
In the right sense

drifting away needs
Right now I’m the cart

way high up in the inter
blue and sun again a second, then night

I argued the days felt longer
I had nightmares though

The days long aligned
In my sight 

The days were long aligned
battery dawn nights blending themselves

always watching
in pursuit of the sight

we had to say goodbye
I tell you the weight of my purchases

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I tell you the weight of my purposes

The day
dawn already formerly nights 

I have a memory between the day
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

deep into pathways from repeated travels
last night

for not paying redundant
with dawn already formerly nights 

on my way to elections
converting sight

own stays brought loyal
my sight hosting

the way was water
converting sight into a purchase

My daughter with her way
battery dawn nights 

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
nights

with constant ways 
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

with no constant way
battery dawn nights

way I was going 
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

on a way to the elections
stopped light with validated fields

at least most days
battery dawn nights ending themselves

formally a way to the elections
That are my right to say

I stay the right of my elections
to the right of a surcharge

I stay the right of my possessions 
The right of incurred elections

or imagined anyway
to the right marking

I swayed a little in my state
the right of a surcharge

We ask say in that case
