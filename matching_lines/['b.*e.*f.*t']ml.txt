['b.*e.*f.*t']

before we can have a retroactive

before anyone has walked across the opening

to be before the sun

Even before the lesson starts

Even before the skills aquired

rewind before the sun

Back up before the sun

back up before the results

before the sunâ€™s deflections

that having been after content

I believe I can prepare for it

breaking from my constituents

burrowed about from repeated travels

it can be uncomfortable 

which as tracked befitted 

by the sight of the hosting answered about

by the side of the hosting service

by the side of the road

which as tracked befitted phased

behind or out front or up above

and could be inflected with reasons

before I act on them

own best form to ourselves

and maybe forgettable
