['been', 'be']

It has been since
here described

After having been contented
Which can be pronounced to the world

that having been after content
after having been contented Strategy comes before morning

having been graspable
that can be attributable

having been an ungraspable time
having been purchased out

having been purchased out 
having been purchased out of you
