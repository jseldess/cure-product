['before', '^stop', 'ce', 're', 'scanned', 'ct', '^that']

before we can have a retroactive
stopping into the prospect
in the space that it had
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
To the ends of transactions
that is by possessed

before I act on them
stopping in the middle
which is not necessarily possible
I presume the offers
