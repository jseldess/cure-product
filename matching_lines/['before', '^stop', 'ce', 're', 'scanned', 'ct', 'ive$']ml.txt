['before', '^stop', 'ce', 're', 'scanned', 'ct', 'ive$']

before we can have a retroactive
stopping into the prospect
in the space that it had
and to which I’ve agreed
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
To the ends of transactions
where I send and relive

before I act on them
stopping in the middle
which is not necessarily possible
I presume the offers
