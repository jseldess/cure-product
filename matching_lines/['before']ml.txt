['before']

before we can have a retroactive

before anyone has walked across the opening

to be before the sun

Even before the lesson starts

Even before the skills aquired

rewind before the sun

Back up before the sun

back up before the results

before the sunâ€™s deflections

Forecasting the story before dawn

before morning goals

Strategy comes before morning

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning

Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

Its strategy comes before morning goals

Strategy comes before goals

before I act on them
