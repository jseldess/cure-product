Then I cannot see face value
such as I can see

as far as I can see
before we can have a retroactive

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
I can find a way to block it incoming

I can find a way to block incoming 
I can find a way to block it in the incoming stream

I can find a way to block it
how can I know without direction

for how can I know without direction
I can’t fix them without direction

We can wrestle them with their goals
We can rest there in them with their goals

Though how can you know without direction
for how can you know without direction

You can hear it also through your leisure
and can’t presume to need

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

Then I can’t presume to feed others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

at any time it can drift again
But I can’t let myself disregard

Which can be pronounced to the world
which can be pronounced 

Which can be called confidence
where I can lay claim to ruins

where I can claim to see the ruins
from where I can claim

from where I can claim to see the mosquitos
I can see only values falling back

I can see only the back of falling values
then I can see only the back of values

then I can see only the back values
I can see only the back of their economic value

That you can see only the back of
That can’t be glimpsed

since I can imagine movement
since you can imagine movement

I can hear it between bills and stuff
where you can earn more 

that I can hear
all that I can think I want

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I believe I can

I believe I can prepare for it
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I cannot clear it also through investiture
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

but I can hear them
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

I cannot hear it between bills
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

You can clear it also through static seizure
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
You can clear it also through static siezure

You can hear it also through static leisure
You can clear it also through static leisure

visions that can be attributable
that can be attributable

decisions that can be attributable
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

If articles can storm in excess
they can be waived

They can be weighed
which we can pronounce

it can be uncomfortable 
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

that decisions can be attributable
Though we can’t help waiting

Though we can’t help waiting for her
I can’t remember them

in that I cannot remember 
visions that can be attainable

revisions that can be attributable
at home visions can be attainable

Having seen more than I can remember 
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
in that decisions can be attributable

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
Or can have seen offering possession

and can see offering
can have seen offering possession

You can have seen offering
in school and can see offering
