['day', 'day']

On a snow day with my children
One day there is direction

interjecting on a day ambition
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

on a day there will be direction
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

One day was actually
Actually one day there is direction

I argued the days felt longer
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The days long aligned
I argued the days were longer

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

I agrued the days were longer
The days aligned for company

The days are long
The days were long

I argued that the days were longer
The days were long aligned

The days aligned long company
The days lined along company

The days of public quantity
The days of private data

The days of parsing data
embodied everyday

The days of quantity 
The days of public data

The day
between that day

I have a memory between the day
at least most days
