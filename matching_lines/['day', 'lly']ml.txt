['day', 'lly']

On a snow day with my children
I’ll get there eventually

One day there is direction
especially in a child

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
One day was actually

Actually one day there is direction
eventually 

I argued the days felt longer
with internally regulated climate

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
actually considering the end

The day
we had inhabited actually

between that day
and literally moved

I have a memory between the day
though it was most emphatically that

at least most days
also didn’t really move
