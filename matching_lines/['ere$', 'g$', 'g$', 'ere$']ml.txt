['ere$', 'g$', 'g$', 'ere$']

The edge isn’t even there
Rather it itself is rotating
not rotating
with goals I find there

what I find there
bring your child along
bearing children along
I get through there

I get from here through there
even when close to my knowing
of my purpose in conversing
in traversing get through there

get from here through there
of my purpose in versing
When closed to my knowing
And we had to say goodbye to her there

We had to say goodbye there
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
unnerving my wing
or in some imaginary elsewhere

firing and connecting somewhere
ground for not paying
latency which doesn’t mean anything
By my memory elsewhere

in memory elsewhere
radiating from housing
and persisting and replicating
but for memory elsewhere

in memory persisting elsewhere
to the right marking
sung reflexing
