['formerly', 'memory']

already formerly a long time
I have a memory between the day

dawn already formerly nights 
and elsewhere my memory

A way formerly like this one
Elsewhere by my memory

dawn formerly
But my not feeling the memory aside

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
Elsewhere my memory

with dawn already formerly nights 
by my memory

formerly a long time they were on
washed by my memory

which I feel formerly about for
after though thereâ€™s no memory

formerly along time they were on
But my not feeling the memory inside

formerly a way
By my feeling the memory inside

formerly away
By my memory elsewhere

addition were filters formerly
but standing in memory

shone formerly along time
