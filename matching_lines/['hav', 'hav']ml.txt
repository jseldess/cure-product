['hav', 'hav']

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I have entered my phone

before we can have a retroactive
as long as I have access to the code

After having been contented
if you have providence to excess

If you have confidence regardless all else
May I have your zip code

that having been after content
after having been contented Strategy comes before morning

and continue along having 
I have them lost

I have them trust in me
having been graspable

having been an ungraspable time
having been purchased out

having been purchased out 
having been purchased out of you

I have supporters
having supporters 

I have a memory between the day
I have entered my purposes

I have entered my purchases
if you have providence

They have very many choices
useless for not having paid

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
I have turned it off

and have no way
I have seen more than I can remember

Or can have seen offering possession
seen having or offering possession

can have seen offering possession
You can have seen offering
