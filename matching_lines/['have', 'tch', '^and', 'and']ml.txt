We’ll have coffee this morning
Where official policy is to catch and release
and my heart rate
and my heartrate

If you have confidence regardless all else
in the sense of watching
and hold and wish to hold
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

I have supporters
I watch a movie
and we could inhabit the room easy
and to which I’ve agreed

I have a memory between the day
When I'm watching my tv 
and that man comes on to tell me 
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

I have entered my phone
so still watch them
and stand and retrieve and pulse around
Is there a baby and a bear

I have turned it off
where I’m watching my tv
and persisting and replicating
my standing in data

I have them lost
that catch
and maybe regrettable 
and came home to rewind inflections

I have seen more than I can remember
