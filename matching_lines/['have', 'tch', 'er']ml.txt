We’ll have coffee this morning
Where official policy is to catch and release
in a continuous vertiginous dream

If you have confidence regardless all else
in the sense of watching
If I take a different measure

I have them lost
I watch a movie
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

I have supporters
I watch a moving afterimage
unnerving my wing

I have a memory between the day
When I'm watching my tv 
there wasn’t any television 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
so still watch them
my in-laws still wash conserving

I have entered my phone
where I’m watching my tv
where I am aside

I have them trust in me
that catch
I presume the offers

I have seen more than I can remember
