We’ll have coffee this morning
Where official policy is to catch and release

If you have confidence regardless all else
in the sense of watching

I have them lost
I watch a movie

I have supporters
I watch a moving afterimage

I have a memory between the day
When I'm watching my tv 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
so still watch them

I have entered my phone
where I’m watching my tv

I have them trust in me
that catch

I have seen more than I can remember
