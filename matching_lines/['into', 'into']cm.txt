['into', 'into']

into rotating directionless 
into the stream of pictures

into the minority proportion of time
at home brought into privacy

already brought into privacy
interjecting into the stream

interjecting into the stream of pictures
into rotating and directionless space

and then into rotating and directional space
into directionless space

into a brigand and a murderer
into the well controlled climate

into the next level head
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
Then I saw into you

talking into percents bending themselves
wearing trying talking into it

walking into percents blending themselves
walking into percents

talking into the cents
talking into the sense

entered into my purposes
deep into pathways from repeated travels

stopping into the prospect
step by into the prospect

converting sight into a purchase
into liminal reflexing

into an own
into the mouth

into an oral
indented into an own

into my own
at home brought into private

stepping off into the middle
brought messageable into privacy

brought into private messageably
brought into privacy
