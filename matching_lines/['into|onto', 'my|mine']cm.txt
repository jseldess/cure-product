['into|onto', 'my|mine']

into rotating directionless 
I upend my connections to you

into the stream of pictures
So I find myself at home

already brought into privacy
I’ll pull myself another personality type

into the minority proportion of time
on a snow day with my children

interjecting into the stream
and at my desk

into rotating and directionless space
They’re just not mine

and then into rotating and directional space
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

into a brigand and a murderer
I take hold of my finger

into the well controlled climate
I was enjoined to act again myself

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Where I take my liesure

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
in traversing my purchase

Then I saw into you
for to tire as far back as my history

talking into percents bending themselves
What I do in my liesure

wearing trying talking into it
of my purpose in versing

entered into my purposes
washed my memory

deep into pathways from repeated travels
But my not feeling the memory aside

stopping into the prospect
Elsewhere by my memory

step by into the prospect
I speak them of my possessions

converting sight into a purchase
with my daughter

Who throws contours away
To the ends of my transactions

who throws contours a way
to the ends of my transactions

The contours exchange with you
But my not feeling the memory inside

into liminal reflexing
into my own

at home brought into privacy
phrase them of my possessions

at home brought into private
