['last', 'sky', 'ay']

What was the last time
though not many facts up in the sky
always watching

under the last seen principle
Up in the sky
We had to say goodbye there

Under the last principle
My purpose up in the sky
She lay under the grass

Under the last principle of purchasing power
While they’re up in the sky
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

Where in me did I last
