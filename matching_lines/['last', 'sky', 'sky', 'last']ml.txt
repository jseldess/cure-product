['last', 'sky', 'sky', 'last']

What was the last time
though not many facts up in the sky
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
under the last seen principle

Under the last principle 
Up in the sky
My purpose up in the sky
Under the last principle

Under the last principle of purchasing power
While theyâ€™re up in the sky
until I purpose up in the sky
Where in me did I last

last night
