['last', 'sky', 'time', 'up']

What was the last time
though not many facts up in the sky
The long time I had a vision
up in the television pleasure

under the last seen principle
Up in the sky
For an ungraspable time
My purpose up in the sky

Under the last principle of purchasing power
While theyâ€™re up in the sky
And for an ungraspable time
And reached up the screen

Where in me did I last
