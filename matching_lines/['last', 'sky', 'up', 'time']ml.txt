['last', 'sky', 'up', 'time']

What was the last time
though not many facts up in the sky
up in the television pleasure
The long time I had a vision

under the last seen principle
Up in the sky
My purpose up in the sky
For an ungraspable time

Under the last principle
While theyâ€™re up in the sky
until I purpose up in the sky
And for an ungraspable time

Where in me did I last
