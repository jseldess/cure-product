['like', '^and']

I would like your zip code
and my heart rate

like flattening sleep 
and hold and wish to hold

A way formerly like this one
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

like a shirt
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

Formerly a way like this one
and end up in Bach

To the other end of transactions like this
and have no way

The other end of transactions like this
and it doesn’t take long
