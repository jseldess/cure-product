The dogs and lillies
I step off the edge
variegated reflected light
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
into the stream of pictures
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
stopped light with validated variegated fields

Then fall then summer from my face
Falling from this distance
before the sun’s deflections
Higher up in the results

I’ll get there ruins
I am first in the office 
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I hear it between bills and stuff
I was enjoying acting against myself
flattening my reception
battery dawn nights blending themselves

which is all the time
I have them lost
reflexing indented in my phone
in pursuit of the sight

that will spur me on
I came after my past
The floor slanted in places
with dawn already formerly nights 

in the form filled offered in trust
Where in me did I host
sung reflexing
the right of surcharge

between bills and stuffed animals
own best form
and came home to rewind inflections
at home brought into privacy

my daughter will learn 
bills and stuffed animals
and could be inflected with reasons
converting sight

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
stopping off in all directions
and come home to remind inflections
