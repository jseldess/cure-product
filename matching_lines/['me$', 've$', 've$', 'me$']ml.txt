['me$', 've$', 've$', 'me$']

into the minority proportion of time
In the light of retroactive
before we can have a retroactive
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

All of the time
with little reason to move
with little reasons to move
but would I love her the same

Would I love the same
where I stand and relive
where I stand and retrieve
already formely a long time

already formerly a long time
where I send and relive
where I stand aside and retrieve
and move them literally with me

pre-worn in me
when I move
where I stand and retrieve relive
my daughter’s squirrel and chickadee joined me

shone formerly along time
behind or out front or up above
in that possessive
