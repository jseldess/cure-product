['memory']

I have a memory between the day

Elsewhere by my memory

washed by my memory

by my memory

and elsewhere my memory

and elsewhere my memory of you

But my not feeling the memory aside

and elsewhere my memory 

Elsewhere my memory

washed my memory

But my not feeling the memory inside

by my memory 

By my memory elsewhere

after though thereâ€™s no memory

By my feeling the memory inside

But my feeling the memory aside

in memory elsewhere

but for memory elsewhere

in memory persisting elsewhere

but standing in memory
