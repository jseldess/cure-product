['min', 'min']

into the minority proportion of time
It keeps coming down thankfully
I want to find a way to block it incoming
I want to find a way to block incoming
I can find a way to block it incoming
I can find a way to block incoming 
I can find a way to block it in the incoming stream
than in the incoming stream
from the incoming stream
or the incoming stream
Theyâ€™re just not mine
The third letter from the end is mine
The ads in mine
articles all around storming around
I let it remind me again
while consuming damage
abjure them with determining 
To the right of determined elections
determined by elections
into liminal reflexing
and come home to remind inflections
remind in possessive terms
