['min', 'mor']

into the minority proportion of time
We’ll have coffee this morning

It keeps coming down thankfully
But in more 

The third letter from the end is mine
tomorrow

The ads in mine
where you can earn more 

articles all around storming around
I have a memory between the day

abjure them with determining 
3 – Memories 

and come home to remind inflections
