We’ll have coffee this morning
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

When I woke up in the morning
But in more 

tomorrow
before morning goals

Strategy comes before morning
after having been contented Strategy comes before morning

Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
It’s morning 

Tomorrow 
Its strategy comes before morning goals

I walk up and don’t work anymore
I have a memory between the day

Elsewhere by my memory
washed by my memory

by my memory
and elsewhere my memory

and elsewhere my memory of you
But my not feeling the memory aside

and elsewhere my memory 
Elsewhere my memory

washed my memory
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

But my not feeling the memory inside
which feels more comfortable

Having seen more than 
by my memory 

By my memory elsewhere
after though there’s no memory

By my feeling the memory inside
But my feeling the memory aside

in memory elsewhere
but for memory elsewhere

in memory persisting elsewhere
but standing in memory

3 – Memories 
more to ourselves insure

form to more ourselves
Having seen more than I can remember 

I have seen more than I can remember
