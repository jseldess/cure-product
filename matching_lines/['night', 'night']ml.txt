['night', 'night']

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

battery dawn nights blending themselves
blue and sun again a second, then night

I had nightmares though
dawn already formerly nights 

last night
with the latency last night

with a latency last night
with dawn already formerly nights 

battery dawn nights 
nights

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
battery dawn nights

battery dawn nights ending themselves
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

dawn formerly nights ended themselves
