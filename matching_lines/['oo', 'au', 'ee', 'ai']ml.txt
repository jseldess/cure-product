The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
because it was really dark
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
at any time it can drift again

Looking back while I should be sleeping
I love my daughter still
I can hear it between bills and stuff
may not be ingrained

in the simple act of opening a book
with my daughter
Having seen more than 
though we are waiting for her

Selma knows too 
My daughter helps too
But my not feeling the memory inside
not needing to wait

Choose a line
my daughter will learn 
between tracked and buffered
visions that can be attainable

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
