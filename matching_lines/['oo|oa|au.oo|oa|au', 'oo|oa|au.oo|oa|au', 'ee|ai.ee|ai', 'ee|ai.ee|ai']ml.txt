The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
because it was really dark
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
too sunny to eat ice cream
So I went back to sleep
Then I cannot see face value

In the retroactive light
of retroactive observations
such as I see
such as I can see

In the light of retroactive conversations
In the light of retroactive
as far as I can see
conversations with our feelings

before we can have a retroactive
Though there are quarters goals
does not feel an exception
drifting does not feel an exception

and without quartely goals
There are quarterly goals
I was enjoined to act again myself
It has been since

Looking back while I should be sleeping
emerging this year from too much standing water
to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water
to see the patterns on the birds

Booked with a meeting
before morning goals
and email
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

learned without too much difficulty to code
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
I see only the back of falling values
blue and sun again a second, then night

upsent in the afternoon
an upsent afternoon
I see only the back
I see the back of the planning process

in front of the set afternoon
not goals
I see only the back of my habits
I see the back of falling values

Not goals or tactics
Running above broadway
I can hear it between bills and stuff
What would I feel without that goal

What would I feel without a goal
I love my daughter still
may not be ingrained
may not be engrained

hauling off the end of the world
in the simple act of opening a book
I need an explicit statement
which I needed for an explicit state

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
So I look up and don’t walk any
You need history
like flattening sleep 

I shivered looking up
I see you knitting uproars with a bow
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

we had to say goodbye
And we had to say goodbye to her there
Sweets and coffee and juice
Sweets and coffee

We had to say goodbye there
and we could inhabit the room easy
Though we are waiting for her
between that day

and to which I’ve agreed
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

The floor slanted in places
by the side of the road
which I feel formerly about for
Having seen more than 

my daughter will learn 
with my daughter
But my not feeling the memory inside
Though we can’t help waiting

Selma helps too
My daughter helps too
By my feeling the memory inside
speech my possession of my children

my daughter’s squirrel and chickadee joined me
reflexing indented in my moan
after having been contented
speech that is of by prospects

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
in school and can see offering
Or can have seen offering possession
seen having or offering possession
