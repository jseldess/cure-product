The prospects there already
Before we walk across the wide field

Before we walk across the wide opening
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Before anyone walks across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the field
Without a proposed budget

and without a proposed budget
by no ventillation my purpose

until my purpose up in the sky
though it was most emphatically that

You use the most essential parts
To that impossible place

from where I can claim to see the mosquitos
to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water

across the retinas
I invited most of what came next

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
until I purpose the horizon

of my purpose in versing
of my purpose in conversing

in traversing my purpose
I have them lost

in conversing of my purpose
in pursuing my purpose

even when close to my owning
even when close to my knowing

even when closed
When closed to my knowing

of those gathered
My purpose up in the sky

Until my purpose 
 of those gathered

I tell you my purposes
until I purpose up in the sky
