['p$', 'm$', 'm$', 'p$']

So I went back to sleep
too sunny to eat ice cream
I can find a way to block it in the incoming stream
The sun isn’t up

I’ll pull my data higher up
for not voting for him
I want to cite a poem
Then the sun isn’t up

So I was advised to back up
from where I can claim
The sun shielding from
I’ll pull myself higher up

but the sun isn’t up
but I can hear them
the opacity given to them
like sleep

which is like sleep
I could consume the dream
Then I continued to dream
– Rosmarie Waldrop

I shivered looking up
I speak to them
the point where I am
in being offered help
