['ple', 'ple']

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Which is a pleasure to never live out

Life is with people
there was no walking along the pleasure

up in the television pleasure
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

simple black spots
Though it is not many simple acts

not the simple act
Though it is not a simple act

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in the simple act of reading

though it is not a simple act
The simple act opening surmounted

The simple act of opening surmounted
the simple act of honoring an accountant

the simple act of opening surmounted
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

in the simple act of opening a book
in the simple act of opening an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
