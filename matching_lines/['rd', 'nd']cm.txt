['rd', 'nd']

in a sharp downward turn 
The dogs and lillies

In a sharp downard turn
and not falling at all

sudden downward turn
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
into a brigand and a murderer

If you have confidence regardless all else
Coffe and

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
and my heart rate

hold at intervals riding forward
and could be mapped and weighed

at intervals while riding forward
appendage

to see the patterns on the birds
And as an extension of the values

It’s the third letter from the end
The third letter from the end is mine

as far back as my history heard
I reuse indelible tracks

falling off the end of the word
falling off the end of the world

Toward the start informally given my reasons
So I work and don’t look any

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
talking into percents bending themselves

missing words
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

missing words 
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

full of the missing words
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

passwords 
reflexing indented in my phone
