['rd', 'rn']

in a sharp downward turn 
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

In a sharp downard turn
in light of learning what we see

sudden downward turn
higher up in the internet

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
When we had jobs that were to earn

into a brigand and a murderer
I keep turning back again myself

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
I spend time online learning to code

hold at intervals riding forward
I keep turning back

at intervals while riding forward
high up in the internet

to see the patterns on the birds
way high up in the internet

It’s the third letter from the end
upsent in the afternoon

as far back as my history heard
worn as it was designed

If you have confidence regardless all else
decisioned to learn 

passwords 
I learned my location
