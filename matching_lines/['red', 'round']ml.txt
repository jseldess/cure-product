['red', 'round']

I have entered my phone
Spinning around the heart

Even before the skills aquired
no solid ground to continue along

until I could not be tired
around my country 

until I could not be hired
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
Articles all around us

of those gathered
articles all around storming around

 of those gathered
around the dogs and lillies

I captured an afterimage
I spin around

I could in effect credit
More reasons around my country 

I have entered my purposes
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

answered about 
and around redundant

and found redundant
ground for not paying

in the form filled offered in trust
buy in the surrounded privacy

between tracked and buffered
bought in the surrounded privacy 

I answered what I thought
