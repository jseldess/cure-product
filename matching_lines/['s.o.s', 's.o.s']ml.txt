white spots on a black surface

I reuse unassimilable visions

all the spots
to catch the spots

I spun around trying to touch the spots
There are spots waiting

I speak to them my possessions

I speak them of my possessions
forgetting decisions 

speak them of my possessions
phrase them of my possessions

that decisions can be attributable
I stay the right of my possessions 

To the right of interned possessions
to the right of possessions

the right of possessions
Possessions 

Possessions people
phrase them of our possessions
