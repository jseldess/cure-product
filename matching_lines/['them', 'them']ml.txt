['them', 'them']

battery dawn nights blending themselves
That’s exaclty what I want for them

I can’t fix them without direction
We can wrestle them with their goals

We can rest there in them with their goals
In a continuous theme

or argued for them at least
I had to tell them the news

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I can hear them between bills and stuff

but I can hear them
the opacity given to them

Then I saw them interview
talking into percents bending themselves

walking into percents blending themselves
I have them lost

I have them trust in me
I designed them to hold up my underwear

I speak to them
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

I speak to them my possessions
and move them literally with me

I literally move them
I speak them of my possessions

speak them of my possessions
pre-worn and still wash them

so still watch them
so still them

 them
phrase them of my possessions

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
where rights ended themselves

where lights blended themselves
battery dawn nights ending themselves

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

dawn formerly rights blended themselves
drawn formerly rights blended themselves

dawn formerly nights ended themselves
ended themselves

drawn formerly rights ended themselves
abjure them with determining 

I can’t remember them
phrase them of our possessions

phrase them
before I act on them
