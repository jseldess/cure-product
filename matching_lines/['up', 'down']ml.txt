['up', 'down']

I upend my connections to you
in a sharp downward turn 

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
In a sharp downard turn

The sun isn’t up 
It keeps coming down thankfully

Before anyone buys up the opening
to the down arrow

over the long time up in the sky
I brought my head down

Then the sun isn’t up
I brought my qualities down

Back up through the results
which I brought down with qualities

back up through results
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

One was up where it should be down
