['up', 'side']

I upend my connections to you
But that is beside the point

I upend live connections to you
Whereas direction is beside the point

The sun isn’t up 
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
I’m simply inside

The sun isn’t up
aside from the retinas

and support digestion
actually considering the end

not many face up
But my not feeling the memory aside

they should rise up
But my not feeling the memory inside

I end up in Bach 
By my feeling the memory inside

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
44 seconds inside

and end up in Bach
where I send and relive aside

behind or out front or up above
