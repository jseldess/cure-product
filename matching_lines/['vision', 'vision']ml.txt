['vision', 'vision']

I had me a vision
The planning process for visions

The planning process is for visionaries only
aspirating visions

aspirating with visions
embodied with little visions

little visions
aspirating with little visions

I aspirate with little vision
I reuse unassimilable visions

The long time I had a vision
there wasnâ€™t any television 

I resume unassimilable visions
up in the television pleasure

up in the television
there was no television to hear

I resume attributable visions
The long time I was a vision

I had a vision
attributable visions

visions that can be attributable
of attributable visions

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
joined in my television

joined in my wasting vision
joined me in wasting my vision

visions that can be attainable
revisions that can be attributable

at home visions can be attainable
