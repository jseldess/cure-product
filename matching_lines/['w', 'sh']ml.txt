Ask who I am to suspend
You should ask who I am

Arrayed out in such a nested way
in a sharp downward turn 

where I sleep at times
I told her a story, she drew waves.

So I went back to sleep
In a sharp downard turn

on a snow day with my children
I shake violently

It keeps coming down thankfully
who are so fresh and agile

off the edge of the world
in short

nor work in this way daily
While I should be sleeping

I brought my head down
A turtle fished out of the lake

I brought my qualities down
While I should be sleeping 

I search with my head
Looking back while I should be sleeping

at intervals while riding forward
I wish my desires were open

and could be mapped and weighed
While I should sleep not back in the results

with my head
shielding from the bandwidth

Forecasting the story before dawn
The sun shielding 

Booked with a meeting
The ventillation rushes on

Tomorrow 
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

without the long time I was accounting
and hold and wish to hold

in the long time they were on
I shivered looking up

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
she lay under the grass

Sweets and coffee and juice
that hold and wish to hold

And from a weak distance
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

They can be waived
One was up where it should be down

I tell you the weight of my purposes
washed by my memory

worn as it was designed
washed my memory

people would be helped
washed my purchases

elsewhere my purposes
The way that she is going

A way formerly like this one
they should rise up

for my own purchases
the constituents should rise up

For my own purchases
like a shirt

still wash conserving
pre-worn and still wash them

so still watch them
my in-laws still wash conserving

Where in me pre-worn
washed

who knows the way
washed I answered about

so still washed
It’s not marshal exactly

who knows how to turn it off
It’s not marshall exactly

formerly a way like this one
shone formerly a long time

formerly my way to the elections
shone from the housing

I answered while interfaced
shone formerly along time

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
if only on the way to the trash

between the preambles
