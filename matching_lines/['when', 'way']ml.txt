['when', 'way']

when we had jobs that was to churn some bread
nor work in this way daily

That’s when they really take
way high up in the inter

when trying to feel the extension of key values
Running above broadway

even when close to my owning
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

when it is not literal
on my way to elections

when I move
who knows the way
