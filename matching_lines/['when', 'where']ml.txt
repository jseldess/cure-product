['when', 'where']

when we had jobs that was to churn some bread
where I can lay claim to ruins

when trying to feel the extension of key values
where you can earn more 

even when close to my owning
where I need gravity

when it is not literal
Elsewhere my memory

when I move
Elsewhere by my memory
