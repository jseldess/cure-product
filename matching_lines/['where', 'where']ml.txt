['where', 'where']

where I sleep at times
That’s where I sleep at times

where I can lay claim to ruins
where I can claim to see the ruins

from where I can claim
from where I can claim to see the mosquitos

where you can earn more 
but where is it

where I need gravity
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
One was up where it should be down

I tell you where I need gravity
Elsewhere by my memory

and elsewhere my memory
and elsewhere my memory of you

where I send and relive aside
where I stand and relive

where I end
where I send and retrieve aside

where I stand aside
where I stand and retrieve

where I stand aside and retrieve
where I stand and retrieve relive

and elsewhere my memory 
Elsewhere my memory

elsewhere my purposes
where I send and relive would be held

where I send and relive
where I am aside at least

the point where I am
where I send and retrieve relive

where I stand and retrieve and relive
where I am aside

where I end and relive
firing and connecting somewhere

where I send and receive
where I blend and relive

where in me pre-worn
By my memory elsewhere

where rights ended themselves
where lights blended themselves

where I’m watching my tv
where I am aside increased

where I am decided least
in memory elsewhere

but for memory elsewhere
in memory persisting elsewhere

I learned the point where I am
where the tongue rippled
