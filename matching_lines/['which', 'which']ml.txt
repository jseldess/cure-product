['which', 'which']

which can be pronounced 
which I brought down with qualities

from which to step off
which I needed for an explicit state

which is the long time I was on
which is like sleep

which is all the time
and to which I’ve agreed

which we can pronounce
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

which ran to be told
which had on honor to be told

latency which doesn’t mean anything
and for which the plan agreed

which feels most comfortable
which feels more comfortable

which as tracked befitted 
and to which the plan agreed

which is what feels most comfortable
which I feel formerly about for

which as tracked befitted  
which as tracked befitted

which as tracked befitted phased
which as 

 as points which are my interest 
which is not necessarily possible
