['will', 'will']

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
on a day there will be direction

On a day there will be direction
will not be the same

will no be ingrainded 
that will spur me on

that will try me on 
would only willingly break

would only speak willingly
would speak willingly 

would speak willingly only
would only willingly speak

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
my daughter will learn
