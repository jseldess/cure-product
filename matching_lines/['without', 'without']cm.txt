['without', 'without']

how can I know without direction
for how can I know without direction

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
Though how can you know without direction

for how can you know without direction
and without quartely goals

and without a proposed budget
without imparting the cynicism

learned without too much difficulty to code
without the long time I was accounting

What would I feel without that goal
What would I feel without a goal

that I hear without trying
without the long time I was on accounting

without accounting the long time I was on
without accounting for credit

without ensuing damage
without consumer damage

My means without gravity
without longer damage

without any further damage
without any longer damage

without really agreeing
without really speaking

without really breaking
without really branding 

without really binding myself
without really binding

without their agreement
without really needing
