['would', 'could']

over the long line I would honor
and could be mapped and weighed

but would I love her the same
until I could not tire 

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
and we could inhabit the room easy

all parties would be held
And we could inhabit the room easy

people would be helped
and could be inflected with reasons
