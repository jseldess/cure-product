Where I sleep at times
I am to end my connections suspended live
Ask who I am to suspend
But that is beside the point
I assumed it was visible
into rotating directionless 
into the stream of pictures
If he had not carried one virtue
to be before the sun
nor work in this way daily
was not just a defeat
Then I cannot see face value
But not to me directly
dislocated and a person from a distance
Where I put it beating
Then blue and sun again a second, then night
off the edge of the world
Even before the lesson starts
and could be mapped and weighed
On the bandwidth I was on
Thatâ€™s when they really take
That you can see only the back of
I tried to feel the key values extending 
The sun high enough to enter directly 
over the roof of the buildings across the alley
Then I saw into you
under the last seen principle
after having been contented
we had to say goodbye
My purpose up in the sky
And need out in front purchase
I came back to me
in the form filled offered in trust
the impulse for my own prospects

and elsewhere my memory 
I have entered my purposes
where I send and relive would be held
they should rise up
and literally unproved
and drowned inundated
I speak to them
which had on honor to be told
for not paying redundant
on my way to elections
washed by my memory
it can be uncomfortable 
not literally moved about
pre-worn and still wash them
Where in me did I lose trust
To the ends of transactions
to the ends of my transactions
dawn already formerly nights 
Having seen more than 
I ask say in that case
speech that is of by prospects
The contours exchange with you
to their other end
iced coffee and sun position
which I feel formerly about for
The right of incurred elections
being seen by me
the prospects being seen by me
