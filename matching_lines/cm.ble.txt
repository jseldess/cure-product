I assumed it was visible
brought messageable to you
by the private preambles

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
And make myself a visible

and invaluable partner
Then the sun isn’t available
or available

Visible or
Regrettable or
Reliable or

Revisitable or
Revisable or
Divisible or

Attributable or
Assimilable or
an unassimilable desire against me

To that impossible place
or an available resource
available

I reuse unassimilable visions
I resume unassimilable visions
I reuse indelible tracks 

The first falling syllable
I reuse indelible tracks
The first syllable 

I refuse indelible tracts
I refuse indelible tracks
I refuse indelible contracts

I resume indelible tracks
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
I resume attributable visions

walking into percents blending themselves
an irretrievable advantage
attributable visions

attributable decisions
visions that can be attributable
having been graspable

that can be attributable
decisions that can be attributable
of attributable visions

having been an ungraspable time
for an ungraspable purchase
For an ungraspable time

For an ungraspable purchase
And for an ungraspable time
from cables reheated travels

where I blend and relive
which feels most comfortable
it can be uncomfortable 

which feels more comfortable
most comfortable
which is what feels most comfortable

that decisions can be attributable
where lights blended themselves
along cables

mostly along cables
dawn formerly rights blended themselves
drawn formerly rights blended themselves

I assume the offers reliable
and maybe regrettable 
I assume the offers revisitable

revisable
I assume the offers divisible
that they were visible

which is not necessarily possible
visions that can be attainable
advised to be retainable

revisions that can be attributable
revised to be attainable
between the private ambles

between the preambles
at home visions can be attainable
that this is possible

brought messageable into privacy
in privacy that is messageable
in that all this in private is messageable

All that I own messageable
but I own all that’s messageable
careening between the preambles

between the preamble
between the preambles 
forgettable

that they were divisible
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
in that decisions can be attributable

I assumed that they were divisible
and maybe forgettable
