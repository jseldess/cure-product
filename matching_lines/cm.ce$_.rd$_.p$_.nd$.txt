COMMON MEASURE [.ce$, .rd$, .p$, .nd$]

Then fall then summer from my face
But I can’t let myself disregard
The sun isn’t up
Coffe and

A person from a distance
hold at intervals riding forward
Then the sun isn’t up
I was advised to rewind

To that impossible place
as far back as my history heard
not many face up
On the other hand

white spots on a black surface
