COMMON MEASURE [.ds$, .ght$, .ere$, .ght$]

stopped light with validated variegated fields
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
The edge isnâ€™t even there
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

drifting away needs
blue and sun again a second, then night
I get through there
in pursuit of the sight

missing words
I thought
firing and connecting somewhere
last night

stopped light with validated fields
converting sight
By my memory elsewhere
I answered what I thought

the tongue and hands
