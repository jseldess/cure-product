COMMON MEASURE [.ds$, .t$, .ere$]

stopped light with validated variegated fields
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
The edge isnâ€™t even there

drifting away needs
I let myself treat
I get through there

missing words
I came after my past
And we had to say goodbye to her there

full of the missing words
Then blue and sun again a second, then night
firing and connecting somewhere

stopped light with validated fields
I answered about
By my memory elsewhere

the tongue and hands
I have them lost
