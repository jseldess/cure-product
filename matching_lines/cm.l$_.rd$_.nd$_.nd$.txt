COMMON MEASURE [.l$, .rd$, .nd$, .nd$]

and not falling at all
But I canâ€™t let myself disregard
Coffe and
Two hours and

impulse control
hold at intervals riding forward
I was advised to rewind
So I was advised to rewind

and email
as far back as my history heard
eroded off the end
encoded off the end

I take it out in the snow fall
falling off the end of the word
actually considering the end
falling off the encoded end

I want to cite a poem so usual
