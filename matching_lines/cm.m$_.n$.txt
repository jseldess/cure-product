COMMON MEASURE [.m$, .n$, .n$, .m$]

You should ask who I am
Ask who I am to end my live connection
On a snow day with my children
too sunny to eat ice cream

I can find a way to block it in the incoming stream
if not directly on my skin
of not directly from my skin
or the incoming stream

interjecting into the stream
One day there is direction
On a day there will be direction
attempted anachronism

but not impart cynicism
as pure as my children Walt Whitman
as a cure to my children
I want but not to impart cynicism

But not to impart cynicism
For whom drifting does not feel an exception
To my children Walt Whitman
and imparting cynicism

without imparting the cynicism
at any time it can drift again
sudden downward turn
for not voting for him

I want to cite a poem
 and time in the train
to be before the sun
In a vertiginous dream

in a continuous vertiginous dream
I brought my qualities down
I brought my head down
from where I can claim

The sun shielding from
I am told ventillation
on the time line I was on
but I can hear them

the opacity given to them
The long time I had a vision
The long time I was a vision
I could consume the dream

Then I continued to dream
Then I continue to dream then
Even the children
I speak to them

the point where I am
to the suggestion
formerly a long time they were on
pre-worn and still wash them

so still watch them
Where in me pre-worn
formerly along time they were on
I learned the point where I am

I canâ€™t remember them
in the long time they were on
I learned my location
phrase them

own best form
the people in form own
in need one in that best own
before I act on them
