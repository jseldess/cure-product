into the minority proportion of time
We’ll have coffee this morning
off the edge of the world
Before we walk across the wide field

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
I told her a story, she drew waves.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

When I woke up in the morning
not calling or echoing for once
Before we walk across the wide opening
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

before we can have a retroactive
Before anyone buys up the opening
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
Before anyone walks across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the opening
before anyone has walked across the opening
That’s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field

for how can I know without direction
for how can you know without direction
For whom drifting does not feel an exception
For whom drifting is not an exception

For whom 
There are performance reviews
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
But in more 

to be before the sun
over the long line I would honor
Which can be pronounced to the world
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

The world

nor work in this way daily

nor envy honest work

Back up before the sun

tomorrow
Forecasting the story before dawn
for the length of the sun
before morning goals

Tomorrow
Having transitioned from leisure to work
Strategy comes before morning
Before morning goals

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
It’s morning 
Tomorrow 

Its strategy comes before morning goals
Strategy comes before goals
The planning process for visions
The planning process is for visionaries only

the planning process for decisions
oddly grown over with historic bark
Not goals or tactics
your bid to the next highest ranked network

or argued for them at least
The days aligned for company
that potential is there for you

where you can earn more 
and support digestion
hauling off the end of the world
as far back as my history heard

falling off the end of the world
tomorrow 
I believe I can prepare for it
falling off the end of the word

I need the work
though as for conversing
the simple act of honoring an accountant
of honoring surmounted

which I needed for an explicit state
I walk up and don’t work anymore
Toward the start informally given my reasons
So I work and don’t look any

More reasons 
You need history
for an explicit state
for to tire as far back as my history

you need history
for as far back as my history
until I purpose the horizon
the clouds hinged the horizon

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
like state mirror
I enter the flattening mirror
without accounting for credit

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
missing words
With a fervor 
storing in surfeit

for an ungraspable purchase
For an ungraspable time
If articles can storm in excess
articles all around storming around

Articles all around stores in surfeit
Articles all around storming around
For an ungraspable purchase
And for an ungraspable time

I have supporters
having supporters 
I click or my zipcode
Is the weight of my click or zipcode

missing words 
full of the missing words
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

Though we are waiting for her
already formerly a long time
I have a memory between the day
in the form filled offered in trust

Elsewhere by my memory
washed by my memory
worn as it was designed
by my memory

dawn already formerly nights 
formerly a long time they were on
and elsewhere my memory
For Mitt Romney

More reasons around my country 
and elsewhere my memory of you
But my not feeling the memory aside
the impulse for my own prospects

the impulse for my own purposes
the impulse for my own purchases
and elsewhere my memory 
Elsewhere my memory

washed my memory
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
A way formerly like this one

found dated for my own purchases

All parties would be held for my own purchases

But my not feeling the memory inside

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
for the duration of answers

the opinions in my world
which had on honor to be told
for not paying redundant
for not paying sound overwhelmed

ground for not paying
useless for not having paid

and for which the plan agreed

which feels most comfortable
it can be uncomfortable 
which feels more comfortable
The floor slanted in places

Having seen more than 
forgetting decisions

which is what feels most comfortable
by my memory 
in the form filled offered trust

elsewhere by my memory
where in me pre-worn
pre-worn and still wash them
Where in me pre-worn

By my memory elsewhere

in the form help sale offered
in help in the form of a sale offered

Formerly a way like this one

Though we can’t help waiting for her
formerly a way
formerly a way like this one
Formerly away there are constant ways

Aligned or not with my interests

The prospect for careening healthily

Having seen more than I can remember 
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
I have seen more than I can remember
seen having or offering possession
