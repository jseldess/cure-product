COMMON MEASURE [.ore, .ll, .ch, .ll]

Before we walk across the wide field
I’ll get there eventually
asynchronous 
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Before we walk across the wide opening
Then fall then summer from my face
about my children’s consumption
Then fall then summer

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
on a snow day with my children
especially in a child

But in more 
Then I constellate my time family country
Which is a measure to never live out
So I constellate the time family country

to be before the sun
I am told by no ventillation
Which can be pronounced to the world
The dogs and lillies

Even before the lesson starts
Even before the skills aquired
I search with my head
That’s when they really take

rewind before the sun
I’ll get there ruins
Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
I hear it between bills and stuff

Forecasting the story before dawn
the dogs and lillies
learned without too much difficulty to code
I am told by the ventillation

Strategy comes before morning
I see only the back of falling values
when watching tv
I am full of potential

where you can earn more 
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
in traversing my purchase
I take it out in the snow fall

I walk up and don’t work anymore
though it was most emphatically that
attesting this is a chance
If you have confidence regardless all else

Articles all around stores in surfeit
articles all around us
And need out in front purchase
Articles all around us

though we are still breaking in

between the drug store and the 
would only willingly break
which ran to be told
without really branding 

which feels more comfortable
without really needing
latency which doesn’t mean anything
in the form filled offered in trust

Having seen more than 
my daughter will learn 
my possession of my children
It’s not marshall exactly

before I act on them
between bills and stuffed animals
speech that is of by prospects
bills and stuffed animals

Having seen more than I can remember 
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
in school and can see offering
