COMMON MEASURE [.p$, .nd$, .p$, .d$]

So I went back to sleep
Coffe and
Then the sun isn’t up
off the edge of the world

So I was advised to back up
So I was advised to rewind
I’ll pull myself higher up
After having been contented

but the sun isn’t up
It’s the third letter from the end
What the next step
That can’t be glimpsed

What’s the next step
off the end
not many face up
On the other hand

though not many freeze up
articles all around storming around
– Rosmarie Waldrop
they can be waived

I shivered looking up
where I end
they should rise up
and literally unproved

the constituents should rise up
I stand and retrieve the impulse around
in being offered help
that is by possessed
