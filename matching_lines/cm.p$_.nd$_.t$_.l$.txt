COMMON MEASURE [.p$, .nd$, .t$, .l$]

So I went back to sleep
Coffe and
Then blue and sun again a second, then night
impulse control

Then the sun isn’t up
I was advised to rewind
high up in the internet
and not falling at all

but the sun isn’t up
It’s the third letter from the end
blue and sun again a second, then night
out in the snow fall

What’s the next step
off the end
I was enjoined to act
I am full of potential

not many face up
On the other hand
I need an explicit statement
I want to cite a poem so usual

like sleep
articles all around storming around
Articles all around stores in surfeit
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

I shivered looking up
where I end
I thought
to take the call

in being offered help
sizes track for asking sound
I answered what I thought
own stays brought loyal
