So I went back to sleep
What is an impure product
Coffe and
impulse control

Then the sun isn’t up
Then blue and sun again a second, then night
It’s the third letter from the end
out in the snow fall

What’s the next step
I was enjoined to act
off the end
I am full of potential

not many face up
all that I can think I want
On the other hand
I want to cite a poem so usual

like sleep
versing my circuit
articles all around storming around
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

I shivered looking up
I thought
where I end
to take the call

in being offered help
In my heart did I lose trust
sizes track for asking sound
The many transparent pixels call
