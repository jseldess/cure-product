COMMON MEASURE [.p$, .w$, .w$, .p$]

So I went back to sleep
to the down arrow
to the pillow
The sun isn’t up

I’ll pull my data higher up
out in the snow
tomorrow
I’ll pull myself higher up

Then the sun isn’t up
Tomorrow
Then I saw them interview
like sleep

which is like sleep
I see you knitting uproars with a bow
that I saw
– Rosmarie Waldrop

I shivered looking up
I assumed what I draw
