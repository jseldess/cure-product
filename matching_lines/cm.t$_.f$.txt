COMMON MEASURE [.t$, .f$, .f$, .t$]

But that is beside the point
I was enjoined to act again myself
I keep turning back again myself
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
I hear it between bills and stuff
That you can see only the back of
I was enjoined to act

or argued for them at least
off the end myself
I was bid to act again myself
I was enjoined to act against

Since I can imagine movement
I was enjoying acting against myself
from which to step off
with full potential to movement

since you can imagine movement
I can hear it between bills and stuff
Would I love the same stuff
all that I can think I want

I believe I can prepare for it
I can hear them between bills and stuff
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
not the simple act

Though it is not a simple act
myself
without really binding myself
and literally moved about

Where in me did I host
who knows how to turn it off
Bach helps turn it off
I thought

I answered what I thought
the least productive of myself
the least instructive of myself
where I am aside at least

I am requesting my point
