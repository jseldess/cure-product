COMMON MEASURE: (a=ve, b=le, c=ry)

I am to end my connections suspended live
I assumed it was visible
Then I constellate my time family country
who are so fresh and agile

with little reason to move
Life is with people
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
under the last seen principle

where I stand and relive
which feels most comfortable
Elsewhere my memory
which feels more comfortable

when I move
most comfortable
Elsewhere by my memory
that decisions can be attributable

where I send and relive
People
