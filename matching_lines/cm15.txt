COMMON MEASURE: (a=ne, b=in, c=on)

I have entered my phone
if not directly on my skin
Of course there is a direction
of not directly from my skin

Theyâ€™re just not mine
at any time it can drift again
For whom drifting does not feel an exception
 and time in the train

The timeline
I am bid to act again
I had me a vision
I am enjoined to act again

The ads in mine
I let it remind me again
here is the site of the battle of maldon
though we are still breaking in

A way formerly like this one
phase decision step in
formerly along time they were on
