COMMON MEASURE FUZZY: ['un', 'ou', 'ble']

But in more 
who
here described

ring
months
execute breath

Then
out in the snow
or available

ink
whom 
the latter

Two hours and
of later results
of later ruins

Ruins results
to see the ruins
The timeline

sun
summer
And make myself a visible

barely outlines
out in the snow 
and key value

but it continued
So stay with us
embodied with little reason

You need history
you need history
like un

abundance
I spin around
And for an ungraspable time

around 
I spin around 
all the spots

The constituents 
I thought
from cables reheated travels

constituents
 to
by my memory

redundant
about the site
by my memory 

redundancy
answered about
like a shirt

I end up in Bach 
I answered about
where I blend and relive

But my not 
about 
the bill my detuning 

out front
people 
sung reflexing

I returned
tongue reflexing
lung reflexing
