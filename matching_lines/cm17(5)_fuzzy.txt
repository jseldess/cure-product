COMMON MEASURE FUZZY: ['un', 'ou', 'ble']

Ask who I am to suspend
I am to end my connections suspended live
I intend my connections

But that is beside the point
Arrayed out in such a nested way
I suspend live connections to you

I upend my connections to you
I upend live connections to you
Where I sleep at times

You should ask who I am
I suspend my connections to you
The dogs and lillies

I assumed it was visible
into rotating directionless 
We’ll have coffee this morning

My live connections to you
Suspended live in connections to you
Whereas direction is beside the point

into the stream of pictures
The sun isn’t up 
So I presume the offers already

at home brought into privacy
So I find myself at home
The prospects there already

between bills and stuffed animals
brought messageable to you
by the private preambles

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
off the edge of the world
On a snow day with my children

Then I constellate my time family country
reasons resources
where I sleep at times

an impure product
asynchronous 
slow

Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?
No! 
as pure as my children

as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
I step off the edge
on a snow day with my children

So I went back to sleep
because it was really dark
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

Between the face of pure joy and an interface.
What is an impure product
Before we walk across the wide field

When I woke up in the morning
it was really sunny
too sunny to eat ice cream

Because it was really dark
my children’s consumption
not calling or echoing for once

I have entered my phone
who knows the way
stopped light with validated variegated fields

In a sharp downard turn
I shake violently 
Then fall then summer from my face

and not falling at all
Falling from this distance
Falling from my face

value falling off the edge of the face
about my children’s consumption
Then I cannot see face value

Then fall then summer
In the retroactive light
I shake violently

of retroactive observations
such as I see
such as I can see

as far as I can see
In the light of retroactive
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

In the light of retroactive 
conversations with our purchase
When I want something

conversation with our feelings
Before anyone buys up the opening
I want to find a way to block it

By being so concerned
All of the time
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

if not directly on my skin
Of course there is a direction
One day there is direction

than in the incoming stream
from the incoming stream
as long as I have access to the code

or the incoming stream
love of breadth
especially in a child

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
interjecting into the stream of pictures
I’m simply inside

and at my desk
One day was actually
Actually one day there is direction

Put in place as stationary destinations
how can I know without direction
The edge is put in place

Stationary destination
That is itself not still
And put in place as though stationary

wrestling to stay still
not rotating
wrestling me to stay still

russling to stay still
I can’t fix them without direction
there are quarters 

Though how can you know without direction
With goals 
I step over the edge

They’re just not mine
with goals I find there
If I step on the edge

or not even rotating
for how can you know without direction
If I step over the edge

into directionless space
not even rotating
what I find there

slow asynchronous
attempted anachronism
does not feel an exception

but not impart cynicism
others desires
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

as a cure to my children
To my children Walt Whitman
as a cure product

The sun isn’t up
as a pure product
drifting does not feel an exception

I want but not to impart cynicism
You can hear it also through your leisure
I’ll get there eventually

Which is a measure to never live out
as an impure product
If I let myself see others desires

But I can’t let myself treat 
Without a proposed budget
Without a head

and without quartely goals
and without a proposed budget
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

in a sharp downward turn 
But not to impart cynicism
To my chidren

Walt Whitman
To my children
Being grown

and imparting cynicism
Without imparting cynicism 
bring your child along

without imparting the cynicism
bearing children along
What does it mean to drift

and bear children along
who are so fresh and agile
Walt Whitman drifted

Puffs of air
or currents of air
I am first in the office 

I’ll pull myself another personality type
over the long time up in the sky
drifting away needs

There are quarterly goals
And as an extension of the values

I let myself treat

drifting away from the task
sudden downward turn
But I can’t let myself disregard

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

So I constellate the time family country

Falling off the edge of the face

high up in the internet
I am told ventillation

Face falling off the edge of the face

The value falling off the edge of the face
over the time line I was on
by no ventillation my purpose

over the long line up in the sky
over the long line I would honor

until my purpose up in the sky
out in the snow
Then the sun isn’t available

I am first in the office
After having been contented

Which can be pronounced to the world
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Did he carry one virtue to excess
It has been since

upset by Gingrich
which can be pronounced 

I take hold of my finger
though it was most emphatically that
I constellate the time

with reasons
not one virtue to excess
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

for not voting for him
when we had jobs that was to churn some bread
The world 

I want to cite a poem
into a brigand and a murderer
attesting this is a chance

If you have confidence regardless all else

May I have your zip code
I would like your zip code

While I should be sleeping
In a vertiginous dream
I keep turning back again myself

Then the sun isn’t up
I brought my head down
I brought my qualities down

and my heart rate
the dogs and lillies
Where official policy is to catch and release

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
Some disease effecting the tree out front
fish pulled out of the lake

in a continuous vertiginous dream
out of remnant pages
of later results

Out of remnant pages
of later ruins
Out of the remnant ruins

and my heartrate
Out of the back page ruins
low in the content architecture

Where I put it beating
my desires were open
Out of the remnants 

Out of the remnants of later pages
Ruins results
results

Out of the remnant pages
Out of the remnant pages of later ruins
Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture

A person from a distance
The CEO tells me to embody values
But not to me directly

Or the company
Spinning around the heart
While I should be sleeping 

You use the most essential parts
Even before the skills aquired
When they really take hold of my finger

Looking back while I should be sleeping
which I brought down with qualities
In a continuous theme

I logged in
I put my bread down
I brought my count down

I put my head down
I wish my desires were open
and could be mapped and weighed

could map to the dimnsions of a graph
On the bandwidth I was on
and the graph ahead of me

I keep turning back
impulse control
hold at intervals riding forward

a similar desire against me
not back in the results
While I should sleep not back in the results

Remnant continuous pages
Back in the results pages
remnant continuous pages

Back up through the results
out of remnant ages
I was advised to rewind

back up through results
higher up in the results
rewind before the sun

So I was advised to rewind
Back up before the sun
back up the results

back up through the results
back up before the results
before the sun’s deflections

Higher up in the results
So I was advised to back up
out of later results

I’ll get there ruins
Out of later results
Eventually

Out of remnant pages 
results eventually
of later pages ruins results

out of the remnant ruins
out of the back page ruins
out from below the fold

out of the fifth page ruins
high up in the results
hovering above standing water

high up in the architecture
where I can claim to see the ruins
from where I can claim

to see the ruins
from where I can claim to see the mosquitos
to see the sunrise

high up in the content architecture
I had me a vision
there was no promotion

On the timeline I was on
The sun shielding 
I’ll pull myself higher up

Then the sun isn’t up 
eventually
or an available resource

sun
for the length of the sun
summer

The sun shielding from
Shielding from it
Booked with a meeting

And make myself a visible
over the long time I was on
I am told by no ventillation

before morning goals
Tomorrow
barely outlines

and email
learned without too much difficulty to code
Having transitioned from leisure to work

Then I am learning to code
I am learning to code
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

The ventillation rushes on
Before morning goals
after having been contented

It’s morning 
Tomorrow 
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

but the sun isn’t up
Strategy comes before goals
competition

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
I just got a letter
It’s the third letter from the end

blue and sun again a second, then night
upsent in the afternoon
then I cannot see face value

I see only the back
of my economic value
I see the back of the planning process

I can see only values falling back
an upsent afternoon
out in the snow 

What the next step
I see the back of falling values
The planning process for visions

is pressing
of the habits I create
I can see only the back of falling values

is passing
out in the snow fall
out in the snow falling face value

I tried to feel the key values extending 
and strategies not tactics
not goals

Aspirational strategy
then I can see only the back of values
I am not allowed to see their face

of the economic value
then I can see only the back values
of the habits they create

Their economic value
That you can see only the back of
The strength of the habits

is a function of the strength
their economic value
and key value

and key value pairs
with key value pairs
with four key value pairs

with implicit regulations
in a regulated climate
with internally regulated climate

I argued the days felt longer
when trying to feel the extension of key values
the strength of the habits

Companies increasingly find 
that their economic value 
of the habits they create.

The next step 
Not goals or tactics
The planning process is for visionaries only

your bid to the next highest ranked network
the next network in your ranking
into the next level head

off the end of the world
aspirating visions
into the well controlled climate

in front of the set of regulations
I am bid to act again
off the end myself

The days long aligned
I was enjoined to act
I argued the days were longer

I agrued the days were longer
tomorrow
I hear it between bills and stuff

The entire company
aspirating with visions
but it continued

I am enjoined to act again
I was big to act again
off the end

My associations
or argued for them at least
The days aligned for company

I am full of potential
since you can imagine movement
The days are long

with little reason to move
across the retinas
The days were long

aside from the retinas
my associations
with little reasons to aspiration

with little reasons to move
embodied with little reason
embodied aspirations

with full potential to movement
I had nightmares though
that I was the arm of this

I argued that the days were longer
full of aspirations
embodied with little aspirations

little visions
full of potential
The days were long aligned

The days of public quantity
The days of private data
The days of parsing data

That company creates a life
Life is with people
aspirating with little visions

In my sight 
I had to tell them the news
but it continued rippling muscle

The days of quantity 
The days of public data
I aspirate with little vision

Running above broadway
from which to step off
Would I love the same stuff

falling off the encoded end
white spots on a black surface
black spots on a white surface

I love my daughter still
but would I love her the same
in traversing my purchase

What I do in my liesure
without the long time I was accounting
Where I take my liesure

I take it out in the snow fall
What would I feel without that goal
What would I feel without a goal

Would I love the same
Undoubtedly 
But would I love her the same

there was no walking along
promoting from home
no solid ground to continue along

where you can earn more 
and continue along having 
and support digestion

than solid ground
because there was no solid ground to continue along
from home

walking along the measure
walking from home along the measure
there wasn’t any television 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
If I take some different measure
I resume unassimilable visions

I reuse indelible tracks 
The first language
falling off the end

The first falling syllable
encoded off the end
First language

that I can hear
may not be ingrained
I can hear it between bills and stuff

but they are black spots
may not be engrained
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I reuse indelible tracks
eroded off the end
The first track

I believe I can
I even know what I would find
I believe I can prepare for it

will not be the same
will no be ingrainded 
falling off the end of the world

that I hear without trying
I cannot clear it also through divestiture
What was the last time

I refuse indelible tracts
I refuse indelible tracks
I can hear them between bills and stuff

all that I can think I want
not many face up
On the other hand

I need the work
though not many freeze up
though not many face up

explicit statements
up in the television pleasure
The long time I had a vision

until I could not tire 
though not many facts up in the sky
I resume indelible tracks

I cannot clear it also through investiture
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
wrapped in static implicit statements

though as for conversing
up in the television
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

but I can hear them
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
there was no television to hear

and stuff up in the sky
Though in not many acts
simple black spots

Though in not many acts up in the sky
though in not many acts up in the sky
Though it is not many simple acts

not the simple act
Though it is not a simple act
ed animals

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Can I clear it through emphatic seizure
Between bills and stuffed animals

Seizure
though it is not a simple act
You can clear it also through static seizure

The simple act opening surmounted
The simple act of opening surmounted
the simple act of honoring an accountant

of honoring surmounted
the simple act of opening surmounted
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

in the simple act of opening an accountant
You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
You can clear it also through static siezure

You can hear it also through static leisure
You can clear it also through static leisure
I resume attributable visions

until I could not tire
until I could not be tired
as far back as my history heard

while wrapped in static
I want to cite a poem so usual
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

I walk up and don’t work anymore
So I look up and don’t walk any
it was not just a defeat

advancing the time
the opacity given to them
More reasons 

around my country 
but where is it
Then I saw into you

Then I saw them interview
You need history
for an explicit state

you need history
flattening my reception
while we’re wrapped in static

until I could not be hired
until I purpose the horizon
the clouds hinged the horizon

I had a vision
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
like flattening sleep 

like un

under pillowing a loud 

the cloud
billowing in the cloud
without the long time I was on accounting

without accounting the long time I was on
without accounting for credit
which is the long time I was on

walking into percents
talking into the cents
battery dawn nights blending themselves

talking into the sense
in the sense of watching
I watch a movie

in the sense of sleep
of my purpose in versing
versing my circuit

I get through there
in versing my surfeit
always watching

the long time I was on
they were on
I could in effect credit

and hold and wish to hold
I could effect credit
in traversing my purpose

of my purpose in conversing
I have them lost
I have them trust in me

an irretrievable advantage
in traversing my circuit
in pursuit of the sight

that will spur me on
in conversing of my purpose
in pursuing my purpose

that will try me on 
I get from here through there
I get here through there

I captured an afterimage
I watch a moving afterimage
without ensuing damage

under the last seen principle
in traversing get through there
I came after my past

get from here through there
In conversing of my purpose
I continue to presume

attributable visions
attributable decisions
visions that can be attributable

having been graspable
that can be attributable
decisions that can be attributable

of attributable visions
I continue to subsume
I continue to consume

even when closed
When closed to my knowing
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

a futile joyous white sun
I shivered looking up
As a clone, illegally conceived

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I came back to me
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

Then I continue to dream then
I could consume the dream
Under the last seen principle

Under the grass principle
I continue to consume 
Then I continued to dream

purchased out
missing words
Under the grasp principle

having been purchased out
With a fervor 
having been purchased out 

Under the last principle 
having been purchased out of you
Articles all around us

storing in surfeit
we had to say goodbye
Under the last principle of purchasing power

she lay under the grass
of those gathered
even my child

Up in the sky
for an ungraspable purchase
My purpose up in the sky

Sweets and coffee and juice
For an ungraspable time
articles all around us

under the grasp principle
We had to say goodbye there
If articles can storm in excess

articles all around storming around
Articles all around stores in surfeit
under the past principle

under the grass principle
Articles all around storming around
abundance

absence glut
Sweets and coffee
 and juice

Under the past principle
We had to buy there
Under the last principle

And need out in front purchase
And read out in front
Even the children

Until my purpose 
For an ungraspable purchase
up in the sky

Even my child
 of those gathered
She lay under the grass

And from a weak distance
I tell you my purposes
And for an ungraspable time

they can be waived
I have supporters
While they’re up in the sky

until I purpose up in the sky
my purchase up in the sky
until I purchase up in the sky

While we’re up in the sky 
And reached up the screen
– The Pixies

I wear suspenders
around the dogs and lillies
unnerving my wing

I let it remind me again
while consuming damage
I used my technology

I continued to dream then
I spin around
where I need gravity

until I purchase up the sky
around 
designed to hold up my underwear

I designed them to hold up my underwear
having supporters 
suspenders

that hold and wish to hold
I spin around 
And from a great distance

While we’re up in the sky
my purpose up in the sky
until I purchase the sky

I spun around trying to touch the spots
There are spots waiting
until my purchase up in the sky

my purchse up in the sky
I tell you the weight of my purchases
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

They can be waived
One was up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes

weight of my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity
Is the weight of my click or zipcode

Where I need gravity
I click or my zipcode
They can be weighed

missing words 
without consumer damage
My means without gravity

I capture an afterimage
without longer damage
without any further damage

to any consumer damage
so that nothing had gravity
until the bill came

That I captured an afterimage
without any longer damage
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses

full of the missing words
I see you knitting uproars with a bow
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
some sort of a futile joyous white sun
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

we had inhabited actually
and we could inhabit the room easy
or alter of course the time anyway

Though we are waiting for her
I thought
already formerly a long time

We had inhabited actually
And we could inhabit the room easy
Or alter of course the time anyway

Selma’s squirrel and chickadee

my daughter’s squirrel and chickadee joined me
which I feel formerly about for
Aligned or not with my interests

I turn not sad exactly
I had entered my phone
stopped light with validated fields

in memory elsewhere
radiating from housing
in the long time they were on

shone from the housing
but for memory elsewhere
by my standing

but standing in memory
shone formerly along time
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

drawn formerly rights
My say to the elections
That are my right to say

the right of my elections
between cereal and economic
my ethereal economic relations

about 
in welfare and hope
My interesting politics

I return not sad exactly
not literally moved
for my own purposes

stay to my elections
to the right of a surcharge
the bill my detuning 

abjure them with determining 
I returned not sad exactly
aligned or not with my interests

The right of incurred elections
determined by elections
To the right of deterred elections

interned 
to the right of possessions
to return what I bought

the right of possessions
behind or out front or up above
or imagined anyway

to the right marking
out front
waiting out front or up above 

in the space out front
waiting out front or up above or behind
in the fill space out front

I learned my location

Possessions 
People

the right of surcharge
at the site of a purchase
I returned to location

as the right of a surcharge
I learned my point
I learned the point where I am

I learned my approval
rendered approximately
I learned my approximate point

requesting my standing
Possessions people
that having been after content

I returned
the right of a surcharge
3 – MEMORIES

possessions people
passwords 
I swayed a little in my state

that their knowing
lung reflexing
My state kept loaned impression

tongue reflexing
state indented in my own
devoid kept moaned reflexing

in my 
into liminal reflexing
the tongue and hands

into the mouth
where the tongue rippled
into an oral

the young ripples inaudibly
My void
and advantaged irretrievably

into an own
indented into an own
indented in my own

Choose a line
buy in the sound privacy
phrase them

possessions
people
that agreed home

own best form
3 – Memories 
I can’t remember them

and maybe regrettable 
in that I cannot remember 
I assume the offers revisitable

and could be inflected with reasons
and came home to rewind
stopping in the middle

before I act on them
already brought into privacy
We ask say in that case

phrase them of our possessions
own best form to ourselves
that agreed one best

home stays brought loyal
the people in home form
ensure to ourselves

and our 
posterity
that agreed to one the people

the people in own form
more to ourselves insure
form to more ourselves

the people in form own
inure tranquility
that agreed home to people

home rest form to ourselves 
own stays bought loyal
bought stays own loyal

bills and stuffed animals
advised to be retainable
I presume the offers

revised to be attainable
the prospects there already
between the private ambles

being seen by me
So I found myself at home
the prospects being seen by me

at home brought into private
the offers there already
revisions that can be attributable

stepping in the middle
So I resume the offers already
at home visions can be attainable

I offer to you
that this is possible
So I presume the offers

brought messageable into privacy
brought into private messageably
I resume the offers at home already

brought into privacy
for a while to listen 
in privacy that is messageable

I resume at home
for a while not to listen
presume the offers at 

All that I own messageable
less only money
between the preambles

between the preamble
forgettable
revisable

in that possessive
and can see offering
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

You can have seen offering
I presume to others 
in school and can see offering

remind in possessive terms
and maybe forgettable
revisital

I assume possession to others
