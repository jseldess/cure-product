Arrayed
Iâ€™ll get there eventually
too sunny to eat ice cream
I shake violently

By being so concerned
One day was actually
In a vertiginous dream
But not to me directly

Even before the skills aquired
Eventually
I could consume the dream
we had inhabited actually

worn as it was designed
We had inhabited actually
the point where I am
would only speak willingly

and literally unproved
would speak willingly only
I learned the point where I am
rendered approximately

after having been contented
and advantaged irretrievably
