['[i|I]f', '[i|I]f']

drifting away
if not directly on my skin

If I step on the edge
If I step over the edge

drifting does not feel an exception
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
at any time it can drift again

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
For whom drifting is not an exception

What does it mean to drift
the drifting is not something special

Walt Whitman drifted
drifting away needs

drifting away from the task
in a moment of drifting away from the task

If he had not carried one virtue
if you have providence to excess

If you have confidence regardless all else
if he had not carried one virtue 

out of the fifth page ruins
learned without too much difficulty to code

That company creates a life
Life is with people

If I take a different measure
If I take some different measure

if I take a different measure
If articles can storm in excess

if there is anything 
if that has anything

if you have providence
if only on the way to the trash
