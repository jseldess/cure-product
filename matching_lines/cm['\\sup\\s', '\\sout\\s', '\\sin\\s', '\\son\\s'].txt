The sun isn’t up 
Arrayed out in such a nested way
Suspended live in connections to you
if not directly on my skin

The sun isn’t up
Which is a measure to never live out
I am first in the office 
on the time line I was on

way high up in the internet
Which is a pleasure to never live out
But in more 
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Then the sun isn’t up
A turtle fished out of the lake
low in the content architecture
On the bandwidth I was on

Back up through the results
I take it out in the snow fall
What I do in my liesure
white spots on a black surface

not many face up
purchased out
I could in effect credit
black spots on a white surface

My purpose up in the sky
And need out in front purchase
And read out in front
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

I shivered looking up
behind or out front or up above
I have them trust in me
in the long time they were on
