Arrayed
Then fall then summer

and not falling at all
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

an impure product
soft paper

as an impure product
way high up in the inter

And make myself a visible
and invaluable partner

After having been contented
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

attesting this is a chance
I take hold of my finger

and my heart rate
When they really take hold of my finger

at intervals while riding forward
hovering above standing water

And as an extension of the values
summer

and email
I just got a letter

an upsent afternoon
I argued the days felt longer

and testing the edge and gravity
I argued the days were longer

aspirating visions
I agrued the days were longer

aspirating with visions
I argued that the days were longer

across the retinas
Under the last principle of purchasing power

And we had to say goodbye to her there
Though we are waiting for her

already formerly a long time
for the duration of the answer

and it doesn’t take long
though we are waiting for her

a precision for learning
the way was water

A baby and a bear
Though we can’t help waiting for her

actions
at least for the duration of the answer

also didn’t really move
I have seen more than I can remember

and can see offering
