['^[i|I]f', '^[i|I]f']

if not directly on my skin
If I step on the edge

If I step over the edge
If I let myself see others desires

If he had not carried one virtue
if you have providence to excess

If you have confidence regardless all else
if he had not carried one virtue 

If I take a different measure
If I take some different measure

if I take a different measure
If articles can storm in excess

if there is anything 
if that has anything

if you have providence
if only on the way to the trash
