love of breadth
on a snow day with my children
Theyâ€™re just not mine
low in the content architecture
I spend time online learning to code

Looking back while I should be sleeping
I wish my desires were open
The timeline
learned without too much difficulty to code
I am told by the ventillation

little visions
Then I continue to dream then
I have entered my phone
literally unproved 
I speak to them

latently from constituents 
my possession of my children
A way formerly like this one
Like this one other end of transactions
I end up Bach

lung reflexing
speech my possession of my children
