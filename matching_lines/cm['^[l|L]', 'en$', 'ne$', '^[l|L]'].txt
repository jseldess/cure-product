love of breadth
on a snow day with my children
Theyâ€™re just not mine
low in the content architecture

Looking back while I should be sleeping
I wish my desires were open
The timeline
learned without too much difficulty to code

little visions
Then I continue to dream then
I have entered my phone
literally unproved 

latently from constituents 
my possession of my children
A way formerly like this one
Like this one other end of transactions

Like this one the other end of means
speech my possession of my children
I had entered my phone
lung reflexing

less only money
