My live connections to you
over the long line I would honor
Then fall then summer
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

months
Credit or
I take hold of my finger
I am first in the office 

my desires were open
like state mirror
Under the last principle of purchasing power
If articles can storm in excess

My purpose up in the sky
which I feel formerly about for
though we are waiting for her
I end up in Bach 

my possession of my children
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor
for the duration of the answer
I am requesting my point

mostly along cables
