No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
slow

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
So I went back to sleep

not calling or echoing for once
stopped light with validated variegated fields

not rotating
slow asynchronous

not one virtue to excess
Some disease effecting the tree out front

not back in the results
So I was advised to back up

not goals
Since I had to hold the entire company

no solid ground to continue along
simple black spots

not the simple act
Seizure

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
So I constellate the time family country

nor work in this way daily
sound inundated for my own purchases

not needing to wait
speech my possession of my children

need one in best own
speak them of my possessions

not literally moved about
so still them

nights
shone formerly a long time

not literally moved
stay to my elections
