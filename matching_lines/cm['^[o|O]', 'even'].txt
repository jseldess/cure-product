['^[o|O]', 'even']

off the edge of the world
I’ll get there eventually

On a snow day with my children
The edge isn’t even there

or not even rotating
not even rotating

others desires
eventually 

on the time line I was on
results eventually

On the bandwidth I was on
eventually

or an available resource
I even know what I would find

On the other hand
even when close to my owning

of my purpose in conversing
even when close to my knowing

of attributable visions
even when closed

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
even my child

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
Not even a [blank] would elect to be

or alter of course the time anyway
people would prevent

only from constituents
