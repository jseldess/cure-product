['^[p|P]', 'even']

PREFACE
The edge isn’t even there

Puffs of air
I’ll get there eventually

path
results eventually

promoting from home to a new job
I even know what I would find

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
even when close to my owning

purchased out
even my child

POST SONG
Not even a [blank] would elect to be

Please neither study
people would prevent

people would be helped
