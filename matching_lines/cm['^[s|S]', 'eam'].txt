['^[s|S]', 'eam']

Suspended live in connections to you
into the stream of pictures

So I presume the offers already
by the private preambles

slow
too sunny to eat ice cream

So I went back to sleep
I can find a way to block it in the incoming stream

Stationary destination
In a vertiginous dream

Some disease effecting the tree out front
in a continuous vertiginous dream

Spinning around the heart
Then I continue to dream then

storing in surfeit
I could consume the dream

suspenders
I continued to dream then

so that nothing had gravity
between the preambles

stepping in the middle
careening between the preambles

stepping off into the middle
