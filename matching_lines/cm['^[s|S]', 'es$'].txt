['^[s|S]', 'es$']

Suspended live in connections to you
Where I sleep at times

So I presume the offers already
by the private preambles

slow
The dogs and lillies

So I went back to sleep
battery dawn nights blending themselves

such as I see
into the stream of pictures

Stationary destination
others desires

slow asynchronous
If I let myself see others desires

soft paper
where I sleep at times

sudden downward turn
reasons resources

So I constellate the time family country
the dogs and lillies

Some disease effecting the tree out front
out of remnant pages

Spinning around the heart
which I brought down with qualities

So I was advised to back up
Out of the remnants of later pages

shielding from the bandwidth
barely outlines

So I am told by the ventillation
I see only the back of falling values

Since I had to hold the entire company
And as an extension of the values

since I can imagine movement
As an extension of the values

since you can imagine movement
talking into pheasants bending themselves

simple black spots
talking into percents bending themselves

storing in surfeit
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

suspenders
I tell you my purposes

SOCIAL
I tell you the weight of my purposes

so that nothing had gravity
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
Where I host my purposes

sound inundated for my own purchases
All parties would be held for my own purchases

speech my possession of my children
– The Rolling Stones

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
The floor slanted in places

service
tracked between buffered and sizes

Selma knows too 
with no constant waves

shone formerly a long time
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

stopped light with validated fields
for my own purchases

stopped light with validated faces
impulse for my own purchases

Selma’s squirrel and chickadee
battery dawn nights ending themselves

shone from the housing
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

stay to my elections
for my own purposes

sung reflexing
own best form to ourselves

speech that is of by prospects
between the private ambles

So I find myself at home
between the preambles

stepping in the middle
careening between the preambles

stepping off into the middle
