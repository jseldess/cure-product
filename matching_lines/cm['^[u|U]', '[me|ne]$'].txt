['^[u|U]', '[me|ne]$']

until my purpose up in the sky
Then I cannot see face value

upset by Gingrich
If he had not carried one virtue

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
I am the first in the office

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
The third letter from the end is mine

upsent in the afternoon
then I cannot see face value

Undoubtedly 
But would I love her the same

up in the television pleasure
If I take a different measure

until I could not tire 
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

up in the television
but I can hear them

until I could not tire
You can hear it also through static leisure

until I could not be tired
You can hear it also through your leisure

until I could not be hired
until I purpose the horizon

under pillowing a cloud
without accounting the long time I was on

under the last seen principle
in traversing get through there

Under the last seen principle
Under the grass principle

Under the grasp principle
black spots on a white surface

Under the last principle 
we had to say goodbye

Under the last principle of purchasing power
And we had to say goodbye to her there

Up in the sky
for an ungraspable purchase

under the grasp principle
Under the past prinicple

under the past principle
under the grass principle

Under the past principle
abundance

Under the last principle
For an ungraspable time

Until my purpose 
Even the children

up in the sky
And from a weak distance

until I purpose up in the sky
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

unnerving my wing
I let it remind me again

until I purchase up the sky
And from that great distance

until I purchase the sky
And from a great distance

until the bill came
I captured an afterimage

Um, upset by Gingrich
We got paid one way by a voice

until a happier time found
the resemblance

useless for not having paid
to the suggestion
