['^[u|U]', '^[b|B]']

until my purpose up in the sky
by no ventillation my purpose

upset by Gingrich
BREAK

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
before morning goals

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
but the sun isnâ€™t up

upsent in the afternoon
blue and sun again a second, then night

Undoubtedly 
But would I love her the same

up in the television pleasure
but I can hear them

until I could not tire 
black spots on a white surface

until I could not tire
but where is it

until I could not be tired
billowing in the cloud

under the last seen principle
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses

Under the last seen principle
between that day

Um, upset by Gingrich
But my not feeling the memory aside

until a happier time found
by my memory
