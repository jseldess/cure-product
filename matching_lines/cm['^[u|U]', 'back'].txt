['^[u|U]', 'back']

until my purpose up in the sky
I keep turning back again myself

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
I see only the back of falling values

upsent in the afternoon
I see only the back

Undoubtedly 
as far back as my history heard

up in the television pleasure
for to tire as far back as my history

until I could not be tired
for as far back as my history

until I could not be hired
I came back to me

under the last seen principle
decisioned to learn back
