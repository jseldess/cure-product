['^[u|U]', 'me$|ne$']

until my purpose up in the sky
I constellate the time

upset by Gingrich
In a continuous theme

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
So that I notice I am the only one

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
The third letter from the end is mine

upsent in the afternoon
The ads in mine

Undoubtedly 
But would I love her the same

up in the television pleasure
What was the last time

up in the television
advancing the time

until I could not be tired
which is all the time

under the last seen principle
I came back to me

Under the last seen principle
having been an ungraspable time

Under the grass principle
For an ungraspable time

under the grasp principle
And for an ungraspable time

until I purpose up in the sky
until the bill came

Um, upset by Gingrich
I have entered my phone

until a happier time found
already formerly a long time
