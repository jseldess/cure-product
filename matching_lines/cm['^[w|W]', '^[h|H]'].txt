Where I sleep at times
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

When I want something
how can I know without direction

wrestling to stay still
here described

where I sleep at times
higher up in the internet

way high up in the inter
hold at intervals riding forward

with my head
higher up in the results

where I can lay claim to ruins
hovering above standing water

where I can claim to see the ruins
high up in the internet

way high up in the internet
Having transitioned from leisure to work

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
hauling off the end of the world

white spots on a black surface
having been graspable

When closed to my knowing
here is the site of the battle of maldon

without ensuing damage
having been an ungraspable time

With a fervor 
having been purchased out 

we had to say goodbye
Having been purchased out of you

We had to say goodbye there
having supporters 

where I need gravity
Having seen more than 

which as tracked befitted 
He has turned it off

with constant ways 
home stays brought loyal

We ask say in that case
Having seen more than I can remember
