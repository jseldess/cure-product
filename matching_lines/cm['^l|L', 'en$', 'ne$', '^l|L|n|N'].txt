love of breadth
on a snow day with my children
They’re just not mine
Actually one day there is direction

ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’
my desires were open
The timeline
shielding from the bandwidth

learned without too much difficulty to code
Then I continue to dream then
I have entered my phone
I have entered my purposes

literally unproved 
my possession of my children
A way formerly like this one
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR
speech my possession of my children
I had entered my phone
battery dawn nights blending themselves

lung reflexing
for a while not to listen
