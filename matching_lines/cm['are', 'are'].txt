Though there are quarters goals
Though there are quarters goals 

there are quarters 
though there are quarters with goals

who are so fresh and agile
There are quarterly goals

There are performance reviews
barely outlines

They are called aspirational
The days are long

I had nightmares though
but they are black spots

I believe I can prepare for it
There are spots waiting

Though we are waiting for her
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

though we are still breaking in
though we are breaking in the space that it had

Though we are breaking 
Though we are breaking

Though we are waiting 
still carefully

 still carefully
though we are waiting for her

There are constant ways
Formerly away there are constant ways

The many transparent pixel calls
The many transparent pixels call

of the many transparent pixel calls
There are no constant waves

There are no constant ways
That are my right to say

 as points which are my interest 
in welfare and hope

careening between the preambles
The prospect for careening attached

The prospect for careening healthily
