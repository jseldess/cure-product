['back', 'back']

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
So I went back to sleep

I keep turning back again myself
Out of the back page ruins

Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
Looking back while I should be sleeping

I keep turning back
not back in the results

While I should sleep not back in the results
back up through results

So I was advised to back up
back up the results

back up through the results
back up before the results

out of the back page ruins
I see only the back of falling values

I see only the back
I see the back of the planning process

I see the back of falling values
I can see only values falling back

I see only the back of my habits
I can see only the back of falling values

then I can see only the back of values
then I can see only the back values

I can see only the back of their economic value
That you can see only the back of

as far back as my history heard
for to tire as far back as my history

for as far back as my history
I came back to me

decisioned to learn back
