Then I cannot see face value
in a sharp downward turn 

as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
I told her a story, she drew waves.

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
In a sharp downard turn

Then fall then summer from my face
I shake violently

Falling from this distance
who are so fresh and agile

I am first in the office 
in short

to excess
While I should be sleeping

A person from a distance
While I should be sleeping 

To that impossible place
shielding from the bandwidth

or an available resource
The sun shielding from

Falling from my face
The ventillation rushes on

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

white spots on a black surface
and hold and wish to hold

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
I shivered looking up

As a clone, illegally conceived
she lay under the grass

Sweets and coffee and juice
that hold and wish to hold

And from a weak distance
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

black spots on a white surface
washed by my memory

in the space that it had
washed my memory

They have very many choices
washed my purchases

in the face that I had
The way that she is going

though we are breaking in the space that it had
they should rise up

where I send and receive
like a shirt

stopped light with validated faces
shone from the housing

I interfaced
shone formerly along time

wealth and the pace of digestion
if only on the way to the trash

which is not necessarily possible
