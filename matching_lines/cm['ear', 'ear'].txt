['ear', 'ear']

in light of learning what we see
You can hear it also through your leisure

bearing children along
and bear children along

When we had jobs that were to earn
One year or

and my heart rate
and my heartrate

I spend time online learning to code
Spinning around the heart

I search with my head
I log in and search with my head

emerging this year from standing water
emerging this year from too much standing water

I hear it between bills and stuff
learned without too much difficulty to code

Then I am learning to code
I am learning to code

I can hear it between bills and stuff
where you can earn more 

that I can hear
as far back as my history heard

I can hear them between bills and stuff
that I hear without trying

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
I cannot clear it also through investiture

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
but I can hear them

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
there was no television to hear

I cannot hear it between bills
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Can I clear it through emphatic seizure
You can clear it also through static seizure

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure

You can clear it also through static siezure
You can hear it also through static leisure

You can clear it also through static leisure
wearing trying talking into it

I wear suspenders
designed to hold up my underwear

I designed them to hold up my underwear
A baby and a bear

decisioned to learn 
decisioned to learn back

In my heart did I lose trust
phase decision for learning

for learning by the prospect
a precision for learning

my daughter will learn 
Is there a baby and a bear

I learned my location
I learned my point

I learned the point where I am
I learned the point of standing

I learned my approval
I learned my approximate point
