['for', 'else']

Before we walk across the wide field
If you have confidence regardless all else

to be before the sun
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

And for an ungraspable time
or in some imaginary elsewhere

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
and elsewhere my memory

the impulse for my own prospects
and elsewhere my memory 

Though we are waiting for her
elsewhere by my memory

in the form filled offered trust
By my memory elsewhere

which I feel formerly about for
by my memory elsewhere

but for memory elsewhere
in memory persisting elsewhere

addition were filters formerly
