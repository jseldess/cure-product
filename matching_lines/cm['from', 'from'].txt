['from', 'from']

Then fall then summer from my face
Falling from this distance

Falling from my face
from the incoming stream

of not directly from my skin
drifting away from the task

in a moment of drifting away from the task
A person from a distance

dislocated and a person from a distance
out from below the fold

emerging this year from standing water
from where I can claim

from where I can claim to see the mosquitos
emerging this year from too much standing water

to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water
shielding from the bandwidth

The sun shielding from
Shielding from it

Having transitioned from leisure to work
Itâ€™s the third letter from the end

The third letter from the end is mine
aside from the retinas

from which to step off
promoting from home to a new job

promoting from home
from home

walking from home along the measure
I get from here through there

get from here through there
And from a weak distance

And from that great distance
And from a great distance

breaking from my constituents
from no one point

and relive from burrowed travels
burrowed about from repeated travels

from cables reheated travels
deep into pathways from repeated travels

from my constituents
and latently from constituents

latently from constituents 
only from constituents

with latency from constituents
radiating from housing

shone from the housing
