['have', 'so']

We’ll have coffee this morning
I’ll pull myself another personality type

I have entered my phone
When I want something

before we can have a retroactive
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

as long as I have access to the code
You can hear it also through your leisure

if you have providence to excess
I want to cite a poem so usual

If you have confidence regardless all else
A person from a distance

I have them lost
If I take some different measure

I have supporters
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I have a memory between the day
reasons resources

I have entered my purposes
sound inundated for my own purchases

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
so still watch them

I have turned it off
by in the sound privacy

I have them trust in me
buy in the sound privacy

I have seen more than I can remember
and could be inflected with reasons

Or can have seen offering possession
