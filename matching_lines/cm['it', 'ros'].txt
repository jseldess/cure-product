I assumed it was visible
The prospects there already

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
Before we walk across the wide field

On a snow day with my children
Before we walk across the wide opening

stopped light with validated variegated fields
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

conversations with our reactions
Before anyone walks across the opening

I want to find a way to block it incoming
Before anyone has walked across the opening

I can find a way to block it in the incoming stream
before anyone has walked across the opening

I can find a way to block it
across the retinas

There was very little physical activity
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

it was not just a defeat
the impulse for my own prospects

The constituents 
stopping into the prospect

which as tracked befitted 
speech that is of by prospects

which as tracked befitted  
decisioned by the prospect

which as tracked befitted
for learning by the prospect

with her waves
step in by the prospect

which as tracked befitted phased
step by into the prospect

stopped light with validated fields
phase decisioned by the prospect

I assume the offers revisitable
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

and could be inflected with reasons
