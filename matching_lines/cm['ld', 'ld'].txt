['ld', 'ld']

You should ask who I am
off the edge of the world

On a snow day with my children
Before we walk across the wide field

as pure as my children
on a snow day with my children

I told her a story, she drew waves.
a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i

my children’s consumption
stopped light with validated variegated fields

about my children’s consumption
Before anyone has walked across the field

especially in a child
only fragments of time with my children

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
as a cure to my children

To my children Walt Whitman
To my children

bring your child along
bearing children along

and bear children along
I am told ventillation

I am told by no ventillation
over the long line I would honor

Which can be pronounced to the world
The world 

I take hold of my finger
I would like your zip code

While I should be sleeping
While I should be sleeping 

When they really take hold of my finger
hold at intervals riding forward

Looking back while I should be sleeping
and could be mapped and weighed

could map to the dimnsions of a graph
While I should sleep not back in the results

out from below the fold
shielding from the bandwidth

The sun shielding 
The sun shielding from

Shielding from it
I am told by the ventillation

So I am told by the ventillation
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

off the end of the world
Since I had to hold the entire company

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
Would I love the same stuff

but would I love her the same
What would I feel without that goal

What would I feel without a goal
Would I love the same

But would I love her the same
hauling off the end of the world

falling off the end of the world
I even know what I would find

until I could not tire 
until I could not tire

until I could not be tired
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

until I could not be hired
I could in effect credit

and hold and wish to hold
I could effect credit

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
here is the site of the battle of maldon

I could consume the dream
even my child

Even the children
Even my child

– Rosmarie Waldrop
designed to hold up my underwear

I designed them to hold up my underwear
that hold and wish to hold

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
One was up where it should be down

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
and we could inhabit the room easy

And we could inhabit the room easy
all parties would be held

people would be helped
people would prevent

The constituents would be helped
all parties would be helped

where I send and relive would be held
All parties would be held for my own purchases

All parties would be held
they should rise up

the constituents should rise up
would only willingly break

would only speak willingly
would speak willingly 

would speak willingly only
would only willingly speak

which ran to be told
the opinions in my world

which had on honor to be told
my possession of my children

speech my possession of my children
stopped light with validated fields

and could be inflected with reasons
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
