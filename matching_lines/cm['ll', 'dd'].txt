['ll', 'dd']

The dogs and lillies
sudden downward turn

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

I’ll get there eventually
oddly grown over with historic bark

They are called aspirational
addition were filters formerly

formally a way to the elections
stopping in the middle

between bills and stuffed animals
stepping in the middle

in that all this in private is messageable
stepping off into the middle

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
stepping off in to the middle
