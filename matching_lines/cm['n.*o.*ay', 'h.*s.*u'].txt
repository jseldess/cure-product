['n.*o.*ay', 'h.*s.*u']

On a snow day with my children
Then I constellate my time family country

on a snow day with my children
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
What is an impure product

who knows the way
Then fall then summer from my face

I want to find a way to block it incoming
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

interjecting on a day ambition
Then fall then summer

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
into the stream of pictures

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
interjecting into the stream of pictures

wrestling to stay still
The sun isn’t up

in a moment of drifting away from the task
Then I cannot see face value

nor work in this way daily
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

Running above broadway
Would I love the same stuff

And we had to say goodbye to her there
Having been purchased out of you

deep into pathways from repeated travels
with latency from constituents

for not paying redundant
to the suggestion

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
Who throws contours away

with no way
who throws contours a way

with no constant way
The contours exchange with you

with no constant ways 
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

if only on the way to the trash
that decisions can be attributable
