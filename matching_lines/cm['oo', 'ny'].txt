['oo', 'ny']

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

too sunny to eat ice cream
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Looking back while I should be sleeping
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

in front of the set afternoon
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

in the simple act of opening a book
I walk up and don’t work anymore

So I look up and don’t walk any
So I work and don’t look any

I shivered looking up
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

we had to say goodbye
there wasn’t any television 

and we could inhabit the room easy
or alter of course the time anyway

And we could inhabit the room easy
Or alter of course the time anyway

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
They have very many choices

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
latency which doesn’t mean anything

The floor slanted in places
if there is anything 

Where in me did I loose
The many transparent pixel calls
