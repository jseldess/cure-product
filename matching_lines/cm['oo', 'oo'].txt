['oo', 'oo']

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
too sunny to eat ice cream

Looking back while I should be sleeping
emerging this year from too much standing water

Booked with a meeting
learned without too much difficulty to code

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
upsent in the afternoon

an upsent afternoon
in front of the set afternoon

in the simple act of opening a book
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

So I look up and don’t walk any
So I work and don’t look any

I shivered looking up
we had to say goodbye

And we had to say goodbye to her there
We had to say goodbye there

and we could inhabit the room easy
And we could inhabit the room easy

The floor slanted in places
Where in me did I loose

Selma knows too 
Selma helps too

My daughter helps too
My daughter turns it off too

Choose a line
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

in school and can see offering
