You should ask who I am
Arrayed out in such a nested way
into rotating directionless 
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Though how can you know without direction
drifting away needs others presume desires
the drifting is not something special
There are quarterly goals

You can hear it also through your leisure
way high up in the inter
higher up in the internet
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I would like your zip code
where I can lay claim to ruins
hovering above standing water
emerging this year from standing water

without the long time I was accounting
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
in traversing my purchase
I get from here through there

having been purchased out of you
we had to say goodbye
Under the last principle of purchasing power
And we had to say goodbye to her there

articles all around storming around
We had to say goodbye there
Or in some imaginary elsewhere
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

More reasons around my country 
The way that she is going
though we are breaking in the space that it had
formerly a long time they were on

bought in the sounded privacy
the way was water
But my not feeling the memory inside
My daughter with her way

The contours exchange with you
with no constant ways 
By my feeling the memory inside
Formerly away there are constant ways

bought in the surrounded privacy 
who knows the way
I am requesting my point
I answered while interfaced

I answered what I thought about
on a way to the elections
 as points which are my interest 
The offers there already
