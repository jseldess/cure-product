You should ask who I am
I’ll pull myself another personality type
Though how can you know without direction
though there are quarters with goals
for how can you know without direction
If I step over the edge

You can hear it also through your leisure
There are quarterly goals
I would like your zip code
hovering above standing water
to be before the sun
I’ll pull myself higher up

without the long time I was accounting
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
around my country 
I get from here through there
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
I came after my past

having been purchased out of you
Under the last principle of purchasing power
Having been purchased out of you
And we had to say goodbye to her there
for an ungraspable purchase
If articles can storm in excess

articles all around storming around
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
More reasons around my country 
trackers collecting data on users
Though we are waiting for her
I thought

bought in the sounded privacy
My daughter with her way
The contours exchange with you
Formerly away there are constant ways
formerly a way
I end up in Bach

bought in the surrounded privacy 
I answered while interfaced
I answered what I thought about
formerly along time they were on
formally a way to the elections
I assumed what I draw

brought messageable to you
The offers there already
