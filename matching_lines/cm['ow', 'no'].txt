['ow', 'no']

On a snow day with my children
asynchronous 

slow
into the minority proportion of time

on a snow day with my children
not calling or echoing for once

who knows the way
and not falling at all

In a sharp downard turn
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
if not directly on my skin

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
They’re just not mine

how can I know without direction
for how can I know without direction

Though how can you know without direction
or not even rotating

for how can you know without direction
not even rotating

slow asynchronous
does not feel an exception

in a sharp downward turn 
But not to impart cynicism

Being grown
the drifting is not something special

Right now I’m the cart
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

to the down arrow
Then I cannot see face value

out in the snow
I am told by no ventillation

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
Which can be pronounced to the world

I brought my head down
In a vertiginous dream

I brought my qualities down
in a continuous vertiginous dream

low in the content architecture
But not to me directly

which I brought down with qualities
not back in the results

I put my bread down
there was no promotion

tomorrow
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Tomorrow
So that I notice I am the only one

Tomorrow 
upsent in the afternoon

out in the snow 
of my economic value

out in the snow fall
out in the snow falling face value

I am not allowed to see their face
of the economic value

oddly grown over with historic bark
and strategies not tactics

I take it out in the snow fall
there was no walking along the pleasure

tomorrow 
may not be engrained

I even know what I would find
will not be the same

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

Toward the start informally given my reasons
until I could not be tired

under pillowing a cloud
even when close to my knowing

When closed to my knowing
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

Under the last principle of purchasing power
I used my technology

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
that nothing had gravity

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

the impulse for my own prospects
and other types of tracking technology

for my own purchases
But my not feeling the memory aside

the impulse my own prospects
But my not feeling the memory inside

impulse for my own purchases
from no one point

and relive from burrowed travels
knowing the constituents

own stays brought loyal
and it’s not literal

in need one in that best own
It’s not marshal exactly

who knows how to turn it off
Selma knows too 

Who throws contours away
It’s not marshall exactly

who throws contours a way
with no constant way

who know the ways to their other end
with no constant ways 

who know the way to their other end
Who knows the way

own that stays brought loyal
not literally moved about

the impulse for my own purposes
not needing to wait

burrowed about from repeated travels
But my not 

for my own purposes
I return not sad exactly

that their knowing
in that I cannot remember 

own best form to ourselves
for a while not to listen

All that I own messageable
traffick is there nonetheless
