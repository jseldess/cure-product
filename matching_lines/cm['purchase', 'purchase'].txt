['purchase', 'purchase']

conversations with our purchase
in traversing my purchase

purchased out
having been purchased out

having been purchased out 
having been purchased out of you

Having been purchased out of you
for an ungraspable purchase

And need out in front purchase
For an ungraspable purchase

I tell you the weight of my purchases
my purchase up in the sky

until I purchase up in the sky
until I purchase up the sky

until I purchase the sky
until my purchase up in the sky

Is the weight of my purchases
I have entered my purchases

the impulse for my own purchases
washed my purchases

for my own purchases
found dated for my own purchases

sound inundated for my own purchases
All parties would be held for my own purchases

For my own purchases
impulse for my own purchases

converting sight into a purchase
at the site of a purchase
