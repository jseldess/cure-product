['purpose', 'purpose']

by no ventillation my purpose
until my purpose up in the sky

until I purpose the horizon
of my purpose in versing

of my purpose in conversing
in traversing my purpose

in conversing of my purpose
in pursuing my purpose

In conversing of my purpose
My purpose up in the sky

Until my purpose 
I tell you my purposes

until I purpose up in the sky
my purpose up in the sky

I tell you the weight of my purposes
weight of my purposes

Where I host my purposes
I have entered my purposes

the impulse for my own purposes
the impulse to my purpose

aside the impulse to my purpose
entered into my purposes

elsewhere my purposes
to the other end of my purpose

for my own purposes
