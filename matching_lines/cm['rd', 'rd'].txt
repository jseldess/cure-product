['rd', 'rd']

in a sharp downward turn 
In a sharp downard turn

sudden downward turn
But I can’t let myself disregard

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
into a brigand and a murderer

If you have confidence regardless all else
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

hold at intervals riding forward
at intervals while riding forward

to see the patterns on the birds
It’s the third letter from the end

The third letter from the end is mine
as far back as my history heard

falling off the end of the word
Toward the start informally given my reasons

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
missing words

missing words 
full of the missing words
