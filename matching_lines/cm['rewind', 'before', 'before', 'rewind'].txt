['rewind', 'before', 'before', 'rewind']

I was advised to rewind
rewind before the sun
Back up before the sun
So I was advised to rewind

So I was enjoined to rewind
before the sunâ€™s deflections
to be before the sun
and came home to rewind inflections

and came home to rewind
before I act on them
