['say', 'act']

we had to say goodbye
we had inhabited actually

I ask say in that case
to the ends of my transactions

we ask say in that case
to the ends of actions

formerly along my say to the elections
I turn not sad exactly

My say to the elections
I return not sad exactly

We ask say in that case
before I act on them

I ask say in that case
