Ask who I am to suspend
I am to end my connections suspended live

I suspend live connections to you
I upend my connections to you

I upend live connections to you
I intend my connections to you

I suspend my connections to you
into rotating directionless 

into the stream of pictures
into the minority proportion of time

I intend my live connections to you
My live connections to you

Ask who I am to end my live connection
Suspended live in connections to you

at home brought into privacy
already brought into privacy

brought messageable to you
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I told her a story, she drew waves.

So I went back to sleep
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

too sunny to eat ice cream
stopped light with validated variegated fields

I want to find a way to block it incoming
I want to find a way to block it

I want to find a way to block incoming
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

I can find a way to block it incoming
I can find a way to block incoming 

I can find a way to block it in the incoming stream
I can find a way to block it

as long as I have access to the code
interjecting into the stream

interjecting into the stream of pictures
wrestling to stay still

wrestling me to stay still
russling to stay still

into rotating and directionless space
and then into rotating and directional space

into directionless space
I want but not to impart cynicism

as a cure to my children
Which is a measure to never live out

and can’t presume to need
Then I can’t presume to need others

Then I can’t presume to feed others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

But not to impart cynicism
What does it mean to drift

I was enjoined to act again myself
to the down arrow

to the pillow
I am told ventillation

to be before the sun
I am told by no ventillation

Did he carry one virtue to excess
Which can be pronounced to the world

Which is a pleasure to never live out
if you have providence to excess

I want to cite a poem so usual
When we had jobs that were to earn

not one virtue to excess
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

when we had jobs that was to churn some bread
I want to cite a poem

into a brigand and a murderer
to excess

Where official policy is to catch and release
The CEO tells me to embody values

But not to me directly
I spend time online learning to code

could map to the dimnsions of a graph
I was advised to rewind

So I was advised to back up
So I was advised to rewind

I was enjoined to act again
So I was enjoined to rewind

where I can lay claim to ruins
where I can claim to see the ruins

to see the ruins
from where I can claim to see the mosquitos

emerging this year from too much standing water
to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water

to see the patterns on the birds
to see the sunrise

tomorrow
Forecasting the story before dawn

learned without too much difficulty to code
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I am told by the ventillation
Then I am learning to code

So I am told by the ventillation
I am learning to code

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

I tried to feel the key values extending 
I am not allowed to see their face

into the well controlled climate
I tried to feel the extension of key values

when trying to feel the extension of key values
oddly grown over with historic bark

your bid to the next highest ranked network
into the next level head

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I am bid to act again

I was enjoined to act
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
I am enjoined to act again

I was bid to act again myself
I was big to act again

Since I had to hold the entire company
with full potential to movement

with little reason to move
with little reasons to aspiration

with little reasons to move
I was enjoined to act against

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
with little reason to aspiration

I had to tell them the news
from which to step off

talking into pheasants bending themselves
promoting from home to a new job

no solid ground to continue along
because there was no solid ground to continue along

as far back as my history heard
tomorrow 

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
there was no television to hear

The sun high enough to enter directly 
the opacity given to them

Then I saw into you
You need history

for to tire as far back as my history
you need history

for as far back as my history
talking into percents bending themselves

wearing trying talking into it
walking into percents blending themselves

walking into percents
talking into the cents

talking into the sense
and hold and wish to hold

even when close to my owning
even when close to my knowing

I came back to me
I continue to presume

I continue to subsume
I continue to consume

When closed to my knowing
Then I continue to dream then

I continue to consume 
Then I continued to dream then

Then I continued to dream
storing in surfeit

we had to say goodbye
And we had to say goodbye to her there

We had to say goodbye there
If articles can storm in excess

articles all around storming around
Articles all around stores in surfeit

Articles all around storming around
We had to buy there

I continued to dream then
designed to hold up my underwear

I designed them to hold up my underwear
that hold and wish to hold

to catch the spots
I spun around trying to touch the spots

to any consumer damage
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
to the ends of my transactions

and to which I’ve agreed
to ask in advance

The sun high enough to enter directly
the impulse to my purpose

aside the impulse to my purpose
entered into my purposes

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
to constituents

I speak to them
to take the call

between the drug store and the 
not needing to wait

deep into pathways from repeated travels
which ran to be told

which had on honor to be told
to the suggestion

I speak to them my possessions
on my way to elections

I presume to others
decisioned to learn 

decisioned to learn back
stopping into the prospect

and to which the plan agreed
and that man comes on to tell me 

– The Rolling Stones
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

 to
stopped light with validated fields

to the ends of transactions
step by into the prospect

converting sight into a purchase
to the ends of actions

to the ends
to the other end

who knows how to turn it off
Selma knows too 

with her ways to the ends
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

Selma helps too
with her way to the ends

My daughter helps too
My daughter turns it off too

to the other end of actions
to the other end battery dawn 

Who throws contours away
who throws contours a way

The contours exchange with you
to their other end

the contours exchange with you
to their other contours

who know the ways to their other end
who know the way to their other end

with constant ways to the other end
to the other end of transactions

to the other end of my purpose
formerly my way to the elections

on a way to the elections
formally a way to the elections

formerly along my say to the elections
stopped light with validated faces

My say to the elections
That are my right to say

stay to my elections
to the right of a surcharge

to the right of possessions
to return what I bought

to the right marking
I returned to location

my reflexing indented in my own tongue
tongue reflexing

into liminal reflexing
into an own

the tongue and hands
into the mouth

where the tongue rippled
into an oral

indented into an own
into my own

and came home to rewind inflections
and came home to rewind

stopping in the middle
that agreed to one the people

own best form to ourselves
ensure to ourselves

more to ourselves insure
form to more ourselves

that agreed home to people
home rest form to ourselves 

advised to be retainable
revised to be attainable

if only on the way to the trash
at home brought into private

stepping off into the middle
I offer to you

for a while to listen already
brought messageable into privacy

brought into private messageably
brought into privacy

for a while to listen 
for a while not to listen

The sun high enough to strike directly
stopping off in all directions

and come home to remind inflections
stepping off in to the middle

I assume possession to others
I presume to others 

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
