['un', 'at']

The sun isn’t up 
But that is beside the point

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
variegated reflected light

Then I constellate my time family country
where I sleep at times

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
into rotating directionless 

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

it was really sunny
too sunny to eat ice cream

The sun isn’t up
But I can’t let myself treat 

So I constellate the time family country
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

to be before the sun
I am told by no ventillation

until my purpose up in the sky
by no ventillation my purpose

Then the sun isn’t available
the latter

which can be pronounced 
though it was most emphatically that

Which can be pronounced to the world
attesting this is a chance

Then the sun isn’t up
and my heart rate

Spinning around the heart
Where I put it beating

I brought my count down
That’s when they really take

an unassimilable desire against me
path

rewind before the sun
To that impossible place

Then the sun isn’t up 
Out of later results

to see the sunrise
I am told ventillation

but the sun isn’t up
Strategy comes before goals

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
What the next step

blue and sun again a second, then night
of the habits I create

is a function of the strength
of the habits they create

is a function of the strength 
of the habits they create.

Running above broadway
What I do in my liesure

I reuse unassimilable visions
What would I feel without that goal

no solid ground to continue along
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I resume unassimilable visions
that I can hear

without the long time I was accounting
What was the last time

until I could not tire 
wrapped in static and explicit statements

The simple act opening surmounted
You can clear it also through static seizure

The simple act of opening surmounted
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

the simple act of honoring an accountant
You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure

until I could not tire
You can hear it also through static leisure

until I could not be tired
I need an explicit statement

The sun high enough to enter directly 
it was not just a defeat

around my country 
for an explicit state

until I could not be hired
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

like un
I enter the flattening mirror

under pillowing a cloud
battery dawn nights blending themselves

under the last seen principle
I resume attributable visions

a futile joyous white sun
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I watch a movie

having been an ungraspable time
that I saw

Articles all around us
of those gathered

for an ungraspable purchase
 of those gathered

She lay under the grass
And from that great distance

around the dogs and lillies
I watch a moving afterimage

unnerving my wing
that hold and wish to hold

And for an ungraspable time
And from a great distance

until I purchase the sky
to catch the spots

I spun around trying to touch the spots
that nothing had gravity

until the bill came
That I captured an afterimage

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
here is the site of the battle of maldon

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

The sun high enough to enter directly
was not just a defeat

So I found myself at home
at home brought into private

The sun high enough to strike directly
I assumed that they were divisible
