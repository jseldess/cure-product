I upend my connections to you
Arrayed out in such a nested way
I intend my connections to you
I am to end my connections suspended live

I upend live connections to you
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
asynchronous 

The sun isn’t up 
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.
a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i

When I woke up in the morning
about my children’s consumption
Before we walk across the wide opening
of retroactive observations

Before anyone buys up the opening
how can I know without direction
The edge is put in place
Stationary destination

The sun isn’t up
Which is a measure to never live out
drifting away needs others presume desires
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

over the long time up in the sky
The South Carolina primary 
It has been since
months

way high up in the inter
out in the snow
I am first in the office
I am told by no ventillation

over the long line up in the sky
Which is a pleasure to never live out
But in more 
If he had not carried one virtue

Then the sun isn’t up
A turtle fished out of the lake
Some disease effecting the tree out front
in a continuous vertiginous dream

Back up through the results
out of remnant ages
I was advised to rewind
before the sun’s deflections

Higher up in the results
out of later results
I’ll get there ruins
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

Then the sun isn’t up 
out of the remnant ruins
out of the back page ruins
high in the content architecture

high up in the results
barely outlines
After having been contented
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
out in the snow 
is pressing
I see only the back

upsent in the afternoon
out in the snow fall
out in the snow falling face value
then I can see only the back of values

an upsent afternoon
without the long time I was accounting
I take it out in the snow fall
I had me a vision

and support digestion
that I hear without trying
falling off the end
white spots on a black surface

not many face up
without the long time I was on accounting
without accounting the long time I was on
which is the long time I was on

I shivered looking up
without ensuing damage
Under the last seen principle
Then I continue to dream then

My purpose up in the sky
And need out in front purchase
Under the last principle
And read out in front

up in the sky
Having been purchased out of you
Under the last principle of purchasing power
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I have supporters
without consumer damage
that nothing had gravity
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
without really agreeing
if there is anything 
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

upset by Gingrich
without really speaking
though we are breaking in the space that it had
already formely a long time

they should rise up
burrowed about from repeated travels
deep into pathways from repeated travels
the duration of answers

I end up in Bach 
I answered about
But my not feeling the memory inside
I have entered my phone

behind or out front or up above
out front
waiting out front or up above 
the right of possessions

waiting out front or up above or behind
in the fill space out front
or behind
I learned my location
