['want', 'want']

When I want something
I want to find a way to block it incoming

I want to find a way to block it
I want to find a way to block incoming

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
I want but not to impart cynicism

I want to cite a poem so usual
I want to cite a poem

all that I can think I want
All that I can think I want
