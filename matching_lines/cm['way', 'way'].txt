['way', 'way']

Arrayed out in such a nested way
drifting away

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
who knows the way

I want to find a way to block it incoming
I want to find a way to block it

I want to find a way to block incoming
I can find a way to block it incoming

I can find a way to block incoming 
I can find a way to block it in the incoming stream

I can find a way to block it
drifting away needs others presume desires

drifting away needs
drifting away from the task

in a moment of drifting away from the task
way high up in the inter

way high up in the internet
nor work in this way daily

Running above broadway
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

always watching
I swayed a little in my state

or alter of course the time anyway
Or alter of course the time anyway

We got paid one way by a voice
The way that she is going

A way formerly like this one
deep into pathways from repeated travels

on my way to elections
the way was water

My daughter with her way
The way that I am going

The way that I was going
with her way

Formerly a way like this one
with constant ways 

with her ways to the ends
with her way to the ends

the way that I was going
formerly a way

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
Who throws contours away

formerly a way like this one
with no way

who throws contours a way
who throws a constant way

There are constant ways
Formerly away there are constant ways

with no constant way
with no constant ways 

who know the ways to their other end
who know the way to their other end

Who knows the way
There are no constant ways

and have no way
with constant ways

formerly away
way I was going 

with constant ways to the other end
A way I was going

I end up in Bach with no way 
formerly my way 

formerly my way to the elections
on a way to the elections

formally a way to the elections
or imagined anyway

if only on the way to the trash
