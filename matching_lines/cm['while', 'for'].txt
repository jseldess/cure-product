['while', 'for']

Looking back while I should be sleeping
at intervals while riding forward

while wrapped in static
which I needed for an explicit state

while wrapped in explicit static
for to tire as far back as my history

while weâ€™re wrapped in static
for as far back as my history

while consuming damage
And for an ungraspable time

I answered while interfaced
but for memory elsewhere

for a while to listen already
for a while to listen 

for a while not to listen
The prospect for careening attached
