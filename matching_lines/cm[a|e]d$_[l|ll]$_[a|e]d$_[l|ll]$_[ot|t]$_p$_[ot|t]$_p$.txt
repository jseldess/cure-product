Arrayed
and not falling at all
By being so concerned
That is itself not still
as a cure product
The sun isn’t up
as a pure product
I’ll pull my data higher up

After having been contented
I want to cite a poem so usual
here described
impulse control
Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Then the sun isn’t up
high up in the internet
I’ll pull myself higher up

after having been contented
out in the snow fall
That can’t be glimpsed
They are called aspirational
I was enjoined to act
not many face up
all that I can think I want
though not many freeze up

The simple act opening surmounted
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
of those gathered
to take the call
from no one point
in being offered help
In my heart did I lose trust
