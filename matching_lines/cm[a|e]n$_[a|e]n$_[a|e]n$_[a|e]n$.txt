On a snow day with my children
as pure as my children
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
on a snow day with my children

only fragments of time with my children
as pure as my children Walt Whitman
as a cure to my children
To my children Walt Whitman

To my chidren
Walt Whitman
To my children
What Whitman

Then
my desires were open
I wish my desires were open
I believe I can

Then I continue to dream then
Then I continued to dream then
Even the children
And reached up the screen

I continued to dream then
my possession of my children
speech my possession of my children
reflexing indented in my moan

for a while not to listen
I only think I don’t listen
For a while I think I don’t listen
