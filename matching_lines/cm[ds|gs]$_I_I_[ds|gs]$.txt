Arrayed
Ask who I am to suspend
I am to end my connections suspended live
I intend my connections

Where I sleep at times
I suspend live connections to you
I upend my connections to you
The dogs and lillies

into the stream of pictures
I upend live connections to you
Ask who I am
We’ll have coffee this morning

between bills and stuffed animals
Then I cannot see face value
I’ll pull myself another personality type
off the edge of the world

Before we walk across the wide field
I’ll get there eventually
Then I constellate my time family country
reasons resources

where I sleep at times
It’s time to wake up, Papa!
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
When I woke up in the morning

Before we walk across the wide opening
I have entered my phone
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
of retroactive observations

In the light of retroactive conversations
such as I see
as far as I can see
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

conversations with our reactions
In the light of retroactive 
In the light of retroactive
conversations with our feelings

When I want something
I reach repeated expressions first
I want to find a way to block it incoming
Before anyone buys up the opening

skin smile repeated expressions
I want to find a way to block incoming
How can I appreciate the face in front of me
I can find a way to block it incoming

Before anyone walks across the opening
I can find a way to block incoming 
I can find a way to block it in the incoming stream
before anyone has walked across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the field
I can find a way to block it
as long as I have access to the code
especially in a child

interjecting into the stream of pictures
I’m simply inside
how can I know without direction
Rather it itself is rotating

Though there are quarters goals
I can’t fix them without direction
I step off the edge
We can wrestle them with their goals

We can rest there in them with their goals
I step over the edge
with goals I find there
or not even rotating

not even rotating
what I find there
I want but not to impart cynicism
others desires

slow asynchronous
But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others
Then I can’t presume to treat others
and is relentlessly budgeted

and is relentlessly planned
In the right sense
I am first in the office 
drifting away needs

There are quarterly goals
I was enjoined to act again myself
I let myself treat
here described

solvents
That’s where I sleep at times
But I can’t let myself disregard
After having been contented

Did he carry one virtue to excess
So I constellate the time family country
It has been since
ring

months
If he had not carried one virtue
I want to cite a poem so usual
with reasons

not one virtue to excess
I want to cite a poem
If you have confidence regardless all else
to excess

Coffe and
Interrupted sleep or
May I have your zip code
While I should be sleeping

with my head
In a vertiginous dream
I brought my head down
out of remnant pages

of later results
I brought my qualities down
Where I put it beating
of later pages

Out of the remnants of later pages
I spend time online learning to code
While I should be sleeping 
You use the most essential parts

Even before the lesson starts
I search with my head
I take hold of my finger
hold at intervals riding forward

Looking back while I should be sleeping
which I brought down with qualities
In a continuous theme
and could be mapped and weighed

the dogs and lillies
I keep turning back
I keep turning back again myself
I log in and search with my head

at intervals while riding forward
I logged in
I put my bread down
not back in the results

While I should sleep not back in the results
I brought my count down
I put my head down
Back up through the results

out of remnant ages
I was advised to rewind
So I was advised to back up
So I was advised to rewind

back up the results
I was enjoined to act again
So I was enjoined to rewind
before the sun’s deflections

Higher up in the results
I’ll get there ruins
I’ll get there ruins 
of later pages ruins results

Ruins results
where I can lay claim to ruins
where I can claim to see the ruins
to see the ruins

from where I can claim to see the mosquitos
I had me a vision
I hear it between bills and stuff
Booked with a meeting

before morning goals
I am the first in the office
I am told by no ventillation
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

Strategy comes before morning
It’s morning 
I get up soon and talk in front imaged
Its strategy comes before morning goals

barely outlines
UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
It’s the third letter from the end

I see only the back of falling values
then I cannot see face value
I see only the back
I see the back of the planning process

I see the back of falling values
I can see only values falling back
ASPIRATING
is pressing

The planning process for visions
I see only the back of my habits
of the habits I create
I can see only the back of falling values

is passing
then I can see only the back of values
I tried to feel the key values extending 
and strategies not tactics

not goals
I am not allowed to see their face
then I can see only the back values
The strength of the habits

That can’t be glimpsed
I tried to feel the extension of key values
I argued the days felt longer
when trying to feel the extension of key values

the strength of the habits
ASPIRATING VISIONS
I am bid to act again
The days long aligned

off the end of the world
I agrued the days were longer
I am enjoined to act again
aspirating with visions

off the end
I was enjoying acting against myself
I was enjoined to act
And as an extension of the values

but it continued
I was bid to act again myself
I was big to act again
My associations

The days are long
I argued that the days were longer
I was enjoined to act against
that I was the arm of this

across the retinas
I aspirate with little vision
I am full of potential
The days were long

aside from the retinas
In my sight 
I had to tell them the news
The days were long aligned

So stay with us
I can hear it between bills and stuff
Would I love the same stuff
falling off the encoded end

I reuse unassimilable visions
The long time I had a vision
without the long time I was accounting
there was no walking along

no solid ground to continue along
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
If I take a different measure
I resume unassimilable visions

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Where I take my liesure
I take it out in the snow fall
falling off the end

encoded off the end
that I can hear
all that I can think I want
may not be engrained

as far back as my history heard
I reuse indelible tracks
I can hear them between bills and stuff
eroded off the end

falling off the end of the world
I reuse indelible tracks 
I believe I can
I even know what I would find

that I hear without trying
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
If I take some different measure
I refuse indelible tracts

I refuse indelible tracks
I refuse indelible contracts
All that I can think I want
On the other hand

explicit statements
What I do in my liesure
until I could not tire 
I resume indelible tracks

wrapped in static and explicit statements
I cannot clear it also through investiture
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
wrapped in static implicit statements

though as for conversing
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
but I can hear them
I cannot hear it between bills

Though in not many acts
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
Can I clear it through emphatic seizure
Between bills and stuffed animals

The simple act opening surmounted
I resume attributable visions
until I could not tire
until I could not be tired

A defeated
So I work and don’t look any
Then I saw into you
until I could not be hired

talking into percents bending themselves
which is the long time I was on
I enter the flattening mirror
under pillowing a cloud

the cloud
without the long time I was on accounting
without accounting the long time I was on
walking into percents blending themselves

walking into percents
I like sleep
I watch a movie
in the sense of watching

of my purpose in versing
I get through there
the long time I was on
and hold and wish to hold

of my purpose in conversing
I have them lost
I have them trust in me
after having been contented

even when close to my owning
I get from here through there
I get here through there
even when close to my knowing

attributable visions
I continue to presume
if I take a different measure
of attributable visions

even when closed
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS
I shivered looking up
As a clone, illegally conceived

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
I came after my past
I continue to consume
missing words

Articles all around us
If articles can storm in excess
where I need gravity
I tell you my purposes

they can be waived
I have supporters
I tell you the weight of my purchases
– The Pixies

I wear suspenders
I spin around
I spin around 
unnerving my wing

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
until I purchase up the sky
I designed them to hold up my underwear
suspenders

that hold and wish to hold
until I purchase the sky
I spun around trying to touch the spots
There are spots waiting

They can be waived
I tell you the weight of my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity
Is the weight of my purchases

They can be weighed
Is the weight of my click or zipcode
I captured an afterimage
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

full of the missing words
I see you knitting uproars with a bow
I thought
to the ends of my transactions

in the space that it had
and to which I’ve agreed
I assumed 
and literally moved

without really agreeing
I have a memory between the day
Where I host my purposes
I have entered my purposes

I have entered my purchases
Then I saw them interview
I send and retrieve the impulse
the impulse for my own prospects

where I end
where I send and retrieve aside
where I stand aside
trackers collecting data on users

entered into my purposes
By NATASHA SINGER
in the face that I had
as it was designed

people would be helped
I though
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
where I send and relive would be held

found dated for my own purchases
I send and retrieve aside the impulse
where I stand and relive
sound inundated for my own purchases

All parties would be held for my own purchases
I stand and retrieve the impulse
where I send and relive aside
and literally unproved

Though we are breaking
I designated 
I speak to them
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

for my own purchases
where I send and relive
where I stand and retrieve
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

and it doesn’t take long
where I send and retrieve relive
where I stand and retrieve and relive
the duration of answers

for the duration of answers
where I blend and relive
Where in me did I host
all parties would be held

without really binding
I move
I literally moved
the ends of my transactions

I speak to them my possessions
I literally move them
that is of I am possessed
that is by I am possessed

I speak them of my possessions
I presume to others
I ask say in that case
speak them of my possessions

worn as it was designed
when I move
When I'm watching my tv 
– The Rolling Stones

literally moved
Where in me did I lose
Where in me did I loose
still wash conserving

my in-laws still wash conserving
I answered about
which I feel formerly about for
so still washed

am obliged
Where in me did I lose trust
In my heart did I lose trust
To the ends of transactions

to the ends of transactions
I ask say in that case 
I ask say in that phase decisioned
phase decision for learning

a precision for learning
I end up in Bach 
The way that I am going
to the ends

The way that I was going
I end up in Bach and Selma
It’s not marshal exactly
the other end transactions

with her ways to the ends
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)
I end up in Bach
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

with her way to the ends
Is there a baby and a bear
the way that I was going
to the other end

to the other end of actions
I stand and retrieve and pulse around
I end up Bach
To the ends of my transactions

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR
There are constant ways

the other end of actions
I end up in Bach with constant ways 
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
actions

nights
way I was going 
I end up Bach forty-one seconds in
with constant ways to the other end

A way I was going
I end up in Bach with no way 
I end up 44 seconds in
on the other end

formerly my way to the elections
I answered what I thought
I assumed what I draw
stopped light with validated fields

on a way to the elections
where I stand aside and retrieve
where I stand and retrieve relive
and relive from burrowed travels

burrowed about from repeated travels
where I am aside
where I end and relive
along cables

increased
where I am aside increased
where I am decided least
mostly along cables

at least most days
where I’m watching my tv
where I am aside at least
Aligned or not with my interests

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I had entered my phone
I interfaced
I answered while interfaced

battery dawn nights ending themselves
I answered what I thought about
I return not sad exactly
not literally moved

for my own purposes
I stay the right of my elections
I stay the right of my possessions 
aligned or not with my interests

The right of incurred elections
I returned not sad exactly
to return what I bought
the right of possessions

to the right marking
I learned my location
I returned to location
I learned the point of standing

requesting my standing
I swayed a little in my state
I returned
sung reflexing

that their knowing
I can’t remember them
I assume the offers reliable
and came home to rewind inflections

and could be inflected with reasons
before I act on them
So I presume the offers already
by the private preambles

speech that is of by prospects
I presume the offers
So I find myself at home
between the private ambles

between the preambles
So I resume the offers already
I offer to you
So I presume the offers

traffick is there nonetheless
in that I cannot remember 
I assume the offers revisitable
and came home to rewind

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
I assumed that they were divisible
I assume possession to others
in school and can see offering

remind in possessive terms
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
I assume the offers divisible
You can have seen offering
