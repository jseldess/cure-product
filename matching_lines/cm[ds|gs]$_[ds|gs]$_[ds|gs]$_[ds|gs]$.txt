Ask who I am to suspend
I intend my connections
Where I sleep at times

The dogs and lillies
into the stream of pictures
We’ll have coffee this morning
between bills and stuffed animals

by the private preambles
off the edge of the world
Before we walk across the wide field
reasons resources

where I sleep at times
When I woke up in the morning
Before we walk across the wide opening
stopped light with validated variegated fields

battery dawn nights blending themselves
of retroactive observations
In the light of retroactive conversations
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

conversations with our reactions
conversations with our feelings
When I want something
conversation with our feelings

I want to find a way to block it incoming
Before anyone buys up the opening
skin smile repeated expressions
I want to find a way to block incoming

smile testing glance repeated expressions
By being so concerned
I can find a way to block it incoming
Before anyone walks across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the opening
before anyone has walked across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the field
especially in a child

interjecting into the stream of pictures
Though there are quarters goals
Put in place as stationary destinations
Rather it itself is rotating

not rotating
We can wrestle them with their goals
We can rest there in them with their goals
with goals

though there are quarters with goals
or not even rotating

Then I can’t presume to need others
If I let myself see others desires

Then I can’t presume to feed others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

and is relentlessly planned
Without a head

That’s where I sleep at times

But I can’t let myself disregard
After having been contented
Did he carry one virtue to excess
Which can be pronounced to the world

While I should be sleeping

with my head

out of remnant pages
of later results

Out of remnant pages

Out of the remnant ruins
Out of the back page ruins

Where I put it beating

Out of the remnants of later pages
Ruins results

Out of the remnant pages
Out of the remnant pages of later ruins
The CEO tells me to embody values

You use the most essential parts
Even before the lesson starts
Even before the skills aquired
I search with my head

hold at intervals riding forward
Looking back while I should be sleeping
at intervals while riding forward
which I brought down with qualities

and could be mapped and weighed
I log in and search with my head
not back in the results
While I should sleep not back in the results

Remnant continuous pages
Back in the results pages
Back up through the results
remnant continuous pages

out of remnant ages
I was advised to rewind
back up through results
higher up in the results

So I was advised to rewind
back up the results
back up through the results
back up before the results

So I was enjoined to rewind
before the sun’s deflections
Higher up in the results
out of later results

I’ll get there ruins
Out of later results
of later pages ruins results
out of the remnant ruins

out of the back page ruins
out from below the fold
out of the fifth page ruins
high up in the results

where I can lay claim to ruins
where I can claim to see the ruins
to see the ruins
from where I can claim to see the mosquitos

to see the patterns on the birds
Booked with a meeting
before morning goals
barely outlines

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
Strategy comes before morning
Before morning goals
after having been contented

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
I get up soon and talk in front imaged
Its strategy comes before morning goals

Strategy comes before goals
It’s the third letter from the end
I see only the back of falling values
The planning process for visions

I see the back of the planning process
I see the back of falling values
is pressing
I see only the back of my habits

I can see only the back of falling values
is passing
then I can see only the back of values
and strategies not tactics

not goals
of the economic value my habits
the planning process for decisions
then I can see only the back values

The strength of the habits
That can’t be glimpsed
that can’t be glimpsed
and key value pairs

with key value pairs
with four key value pairs
with implicit regulations
in front of the set of regulations

I tried to feel the extension of key values
when trying to feel the extension of key values
the strength of the habits
Not goals or tactics

the next network in your ranking
into the next level head
off the end of the world
aspirating visions

The days long aligned
aspirating with visions
but it continued
off the end

My associations
The days are long
across the retinas
The days were long

aside from the retinas
my associations
embodied aspirations
embodied with little visions

that I was the arm of this
full of aspirations
embodied with little aspirations
little visions

The days were long aligned
So stay with us
aspirating with little visions
As an extension of the values

I had to tell them the news
falling off the encoded end
I reuse unassimilable visions
talking into pheasants bending themselves

without the long time I was accounting
there was no walking along
no solid ground to continue along
than solid ground

because there was no solid ground to continue along
– The Pixies
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I resume unassimilable visions

falling off the end
encoded off the end
hauling off the end of the world
may not be ingrained

but they are black spots
may not be engrained
as far back as my history heard
I reuse indelible tracks

eroded off the end
falling off the end of the world
I even know what I would find
that I hear without trying

falling off the end of the word
actually considering the end
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I refuse indelible tracts

I refuse indelible tracks
I refuse indelible contracts
On the other hand
explicit statements

I resume indelible tracks
wrapped in static and explicit statements
wrapped in static implicit statements
though as for conversing

I cannot hear it between bills
Though in not many acts
simple black spots
Though in not many facts

Though it is not many simple acts
ed animals
in the simple act of reading
Between bills and stuffed animals

The simple act opening surmounted
The simple act of opening surmounted
of honoring surmounted
the simple act of opening surmounted

I resume attributable visions
until I could not be tired
A defeated
Toward the start informally given my reasons

until I could not be hired
talking into percents bending themselves
under pillowing a cloud
the cloud

billowing in the cloud
without the long time I was on accounting
walking into percents blending themselves
walking into percents

talking into the cents
in the sense of watching
of my purpose in versing
of my purpose in conversing

always watching
and hold and wish to hold
even when close to my owning
even when close to my knowing

attributable visions
attributable decisions
of attributable visions
even when closed

When closed to my knowing
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
As a clone, illegally conceived
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
missing words
Articles all around us
she lay under the grass

of those gathered
even my child
articles all around us
If articles can storm in excess

articles all around storming around
Articles all around storming around
Even my child
 of those gathered

She lay under the grass
I tell you my purposes
they can be waived
I have supporters

I tell you the weight of my purchases
I wear suspenders
around the dogs and lillies
I spin around

unnerving my wing
suspenders
that hold and wish to hold
all the spots

to catch the spots
I spun around trying to touch the spots
There are spots waiting
They can be waived

They can be weighed
I tell you the weight of my purposes
weight of my purposes
Is the weight of my purchases

full of the missing words
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
to the ends of my transactions
in the space that it had

worn as it was designed
and to which I’ve agreed
all parties would be held
and literally moved

without really agreeing
if that has anything
Where I host my purposes
I have entered my purposes

I have entered my purchases

All parties would be held
For my own purchases

The ends of my transactions

I stand and retrieve the impulse around

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
and it doesn’t take long

burrowed about from repeated travels

from cables reheated travels
deep into pathways from repeated travels

and latently from constituents
only from constituents
with latency from constituents

on behalf of imagined
constituents
knowing the constituents

which ran to be told
the opinions in my world
which had on honor to be told
for not paying sound overwhelmed

ground for not paying
latency which doesn’t mean anything
until a happier time found
useless for not having paid

uses for the attention of the brand
myself moved literally as it is
and for which the plan agreed
without really binding

I literally moved

I speak to them my possessions

The floor slanted in places

To the ends of my transactions
