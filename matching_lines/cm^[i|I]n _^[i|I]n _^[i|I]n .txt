in a sharp downward turn 
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions,

In a sharp downard turn
In the retroactive light
In the light of retroactive conversations

In the light of retroactive
In the light of retroactive 
in light of learning what we see

in rotating directionless space
In the right sense
in a moment of drifting away from the task

In a vertiginous dream
in a continuous vertiginous dream

In a continuous theme
in front of the set afternoon
in a regulated climate

in front of the set of regulations
In my sight 
in traversing my purchase

in the time
in not many tracks up in the sky
in the simple act of reading

in the simple act of opening a book
in the simple act of opening an accountant
in the sense of watching

in the sense of sleep
in versing my surfeit
in traversing my purpose

in the long time they were on
in traversing my circuit
in pursuit of the sight

in conversing of my purpose
in pursuing my purpose

in the face that I had
in need one in that best own
in the face that it had

in the form filled offered trust
in the form filled offered must
in the form filled offered trust 

in the form filled offered
in the form help sale offered
in help in the form of a sale offered

in being offered help
In my heart did I lose trust
In what part did I lose trust

in track and buffer 
in track as offer asked 
in my increased capacity

in data
in memory elsewhere
in memory persisting elsewhere

in welfare and hope
in the fill space 
in the fill space

in the space out front
in the fill space out front
in my state

in my
in my 
in my freight kept owned impression

in that I cannot remember 
in privacy that is messageable
in that all this in private is messageable

in that decisions can be attributable
in that possessive
in school and can see offering
