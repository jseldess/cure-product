too sunny to eat ice cream
To my children Walt Whitman
To my chidren
To my children

to the down arrow
to the pillow
to be before the sun
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

to excess
To neither study
To that impossible place
to see the ruins

to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water
to see the patterns on the birds
to see the sunrise
tomorrow

Tomorrow
Tomorrow 
tomorrow 
Toward the start informally given my reasons

to catch the spots
to any consumer damage
to the ends of my transactions
to ask in advance

To substitute neither study
to constituents
to take the call
to the suggestion

To the ends of transactions
to the ends of transactions
to the ends of actions
to the ends

to the other end
to stand and retrieve and pulse around
to the other end of actions
to the other end battery dawn 

To the ends of my transactions
to their other end
to their other contours
To the other end of transactions

To the other end of my actions
To the other end of transactions like this
To the other end of means like this one
to the other end of transactions

to the other end of my purpose
to the right of a surcharge
To the right of determined elections
To the right of interned possessions

To the right of deterred elections
To the right of interned elections
to the right of possessions
to return what I bought

to the right marking
tongue reflexing
