[^if, g$, g$, ^and]

if not directly on my skin
When I want something
Before anyone walks across the opening
and at my desk

if you have providence to excess
ring
While I should be sleeping
and my heart rate

if I take a different measure
of my purpose in versing
even when close to my knowing
and hold and wish to hold

if there is anything 
if that has anything
not speaking
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

if only on the way to the trash
and can see offering
You can have seen offering
and maybe regrettable
