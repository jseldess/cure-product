[^if, r$, ^and, r$]

if not directly on my skin
Then fall then summer
and at my desk
Puffs of air

if you have providence to excess
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
and my heart rate
I take hold of my finger

if I take a different measure
Under the last principle of purchasing power
and hold and wish to hold
designed to hold up my underwear

if there is anything 
A baby and a bear
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
for the duration of the answer

if that has anything
Though we are waiting for her
and to which I’ve agreed
which I feel formerly about for

if only on the way to the trash
I have seen more than I can remember
and can see offering
