COMMON MEASURE [^the, ^the, ^the]

there are quarters 
the drifting is not something special
the latter

the down arrow
the dogs and lillies
there was no promotion

then I cannot see face value
then I can see only the back of values
the planning process for decisions

then I can see only the back values
they create
their economic value

the strength of the habits
the next network in your ranking
there was no walking along the pleasure

there was no walking along
there wasnâ€™t any television 
there was no television to hear

the simple act of honoring an accountant
the simple act of opening surmounted
the opacity given to them

the clouds hinged the horizon
the cloud
the long time I was on

they were on
they can be waived
the impulse for my own prospects

the impulse for my own purposes
the impulse for my own purchases
the impulse to my purpose

the impulse my own prospects
they should rise up
the constituents should rise up

the point where I am
the duration of answers
the opinions in my world

the resemblance
the 
the ends of my transactions

the way was water
the other end transactions
the way that I was going

the contours exchange with you
the other end of actions
the least productive of myself

the least instructive of myself
the right of my elections
the bill my detuning 

the right of possessions
the right of surcharge
the right of a surcharge

the tongue and hands
the young ripples inaudibly
the void kept owned impression

the people in home form
the people in own form
the people in form own

the prospects there already
the prospects being seen by me
the offers there already
