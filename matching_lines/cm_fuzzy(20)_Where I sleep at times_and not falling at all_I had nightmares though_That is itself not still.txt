[Where I sleep at times, and not falling at all, I had nightmares though, That is itself not still]

Arrayed
I am to end my connections suspended live
Arrayed out in such a nested way
I intend my connections

But that is beside the point
Where I sleep at times
Ask who I am to suspend
I suspend live connections to you

I upend my connections to you
I upend live connections to you
I intend my connections to you
Whereas direction is beside the point

I suspend my connections to you
The dogs and lillies
I step off the edge
I assumed it was visible

into rotating directionless 
into the stream of pictures
into the minority proportion of time
The sun isn’t up 

Ask who I am
We’ll have coffee this morning
I intend my live connections to you
My live connections to you

Ask who I am to end my live connection
Suspended live in connections to you
You should ask who I am
So I presume the offers already

at home brought into privacy
So I find myself at home
already brought into privacy
The prospects there already

between bills and stuffed animals
brought messageable to you
Then I cannot see face value
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I’ll pull myself another personality type
off the edge of the world
On a snow day with my children
Before we walk across the wide field

variegated reflected light
I’ll get there eventually
Then I constellate my time family country
reasons resources

in a sharp downward turn 
where I sleep at times
an impure product
drifting away

slow
It’s time to wake up, Papa!
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?
No! 

as pure as my children
on a snow day with my children
I told her a story, she drew waves.
So I went back to sleep

because it was really dark
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.
a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i
What is an impure product

When I woke up in the morning
it was really sunny
too sunny to eat ice cream
Because it was really dark

Then fall then summer from my face
my children’s consumption
not calling or echoing for once
I have entered my phone

Before we walk across the wide opening
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
who knows the way
stopped light with validated variegated fields

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
In a sharp downard turn
I shake violently 

and not falling at all
Falling from this distance
Falling from my face
Face falling off the edge of the face

value falling off the edge of the face
about my children’s consumption
Then fall then summer
I reach repeated expressions first

In the retroactive light
I shake violently
of retroactive observations
such as I see

such as I can see
It keeps coming down thankfully
In the light of retroactive conversations
conversations with our purchase

as far as I can see
Before anyone walks across the wide opening
In the light of retroactive
conversations with our reactions

In the light of retroactive 
conversations with our feelings
Of course there is a direction
When I want something

before we can have a retroactive
conversation with our feelings
in light of learning what we see
I want to find a way to block it incoming

I propogated repeated expressions first
Before anyone buys up the opening
I want to find a way to block it
skin smile repeated expressions

I want to find a way to block incoming
smile testing glance repeated expressions
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
By being so concerned

All of the time
How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
I can find a way to block it incoming

if not directly on my skin
interjecting on a day ambition
Before anyone walks across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the opening

I can find a way to block incoming 
I can find a way to block it in the incoming stream
than in the incoming stream
I can find a way to block it

before anyone has walked across the opening
That’s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field
from the incoming stream

of not directly from my skin
as long as I have access to the code
or the incoming stream
I’m simply inside

and at my desk
love of breadth
especially in a child
One day there is direction

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
only fragments of time with my children
on a day there will be direction
interjecting into the stream

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
interferring 
interjecting into the stream of pictures
On a day there will be direction

One day was actually
Though there are quarters goals
They’re just not mine
Actually one day there is direction

Though there are quarters goals 
Put in place as stationary destinations
how can I know without direction
for how can I know without direction

The edge is put in place
Stationary destination
That is itself not still
As though stationary and a destination

The edge isn’t even there
Rather it itself is rotating
And put in place as though stationary
in rotating directionless space

wrestling to stay still
not rotating
wrestling me to stay still
russling to stay still

I can’t fix them without direction
there are quarters 
We can wrestle them with their goals
We can rest there in them with their goals

into rotating and directionless space
with goals
Though how can you know without direction
With goals 

I step over the edge
though there are quarters with goals
with goals I find there
If I step on the edge

and then into rotating and directional space
or not even rotating
for how can you know without direction
If I step over the edge

into directionless space
not even rotating
what I find there
slow asynchronous

attempted anachronism

I want but not to impart cynicism

as a cure to my children
To my children Walt Whitman
as a cure product

The sun isn’t up
as a pure product
drifting does not feel an exception
You can hear it also through your leisure

Which is a measure to never live out
and can’t presume to need
But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

If I let myself see others desires
drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

at any time it can drift again
I let myself treat
and is relentlessly budgeted
and is relentlessly planned

In the right sense
Without a head
and without quartely goals
and without a proposed budget

But not to impart cynicism
For whom drifting does not feel an exception
To my chidren
Walt Whitman

For whom drifting is not an exception
To my children
What Whitman
For whom 

Without imparting cynicism 
bring your child along
without imparting the cynicism
bearing children along

What does it mean to drift
and bear children along
who are so fresh and agile
the drifting is not something special

Walt Whitman drifted
Puffs of air

Right now I’m the cart

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

In a vertiginous dream

I keep turning back again myself
I brought my head down
I brought my qualities down

A turtle fished out of the lake

Some disease effecting the tree out front

Even before the lesson starts

Even before the skills aquired
When they really take hold of my finger
I search with my head
That’s when they really take

hold at intervals riding forward
Looking back while I should be sleeping
at intervals while riding forward
which I brought down with qualities

In a continuous theme
I logged in
I put my bread down
I brought my count down

I put my head down

could map to the dimnsions of a graph

I see only the back of falling values
blue and sun again a second, then night

The planning process for visions
upsent in the afternoon
then I cannot see face value
I see only the back

of my economic value
I see the back of the planning process
I see the back of falling values
I can see only values falling back

an upsent afternoon
out in the snow 
What the next step
is pressing

I see only the back of my habits
of the habits I create
I can see only the back of falling values
is passing

out in the snow fall
out in the snow falling face value
then I can see only the back of values
in front of the set afternoon

I tried to feel the key values extending 
I argued the days felt longer
and testing the edge and gravity
What’s the next step

The next step 
The planning process is for visionaries only
and strategies not tactics
not goals

of the economic value my habits
the planning process for decisions
Aspirational strategy
I am not allowed to see their face

of the economic value
then I can see only the back values
of the habits they create
I can see only the back of their economic value

That you can see only the back of
The strength of the habits
they create
increasingly that their economic value

is a function of the strength
That can’t be glimpsed

Companies increasingly find 
that their economic value

Not goals or tactics
They are called aspirational
your bid to the next highest ranked network

the next network in your ranking
into the next level head
off the end of the world
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating visions
when watching tv
I am bid to act again
off the end myself

The days long aligned
I argued the days were longer
I was enjoying acting against myself
I was enjoined to act

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
I agrued the days were longer
The entire company

aspirating with visions
but it continued
I am enjoined to act again
I was bid to act again myself

I was big to act again
off the end
Since I had to hold the entire company
My associations

or argued for them at least
since I can imagine movement
I am full of potential
with full potential to movement

since you can imagine movement
The days are long
with little reason to move
across the retinas

The days were long
There was very little physical activity
aside from the retinas
I argued that the days were longer

my associations
with little reasons to aspiration
with little reasons to move
embodied with little reason

embodied aspirations
embodied with little visions
I was enjoined to act against
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

Since I can imagine movement
I invited most of what came next
I had nightmares though
that I was the arm of this

The days aligned for company
full of aspirations
embodied with little aspirations
little visions

full of potential
The days were long aligned
The days aligned long company
The days lined along company

The days of public quantity
The days of private data
The days of parsing data
That company creates a life

Life is with people
So stay with us
aspirating with little visions
I aspirate with little vision

with little reason to aspiration
embodied everyday
As an extension of the values
that potential is there for you

In my sight 
I had to tell them the news
but it continued rippling muscle
from which to step off

The days of quantity 
The days of public data
I can hear it between bills and stuff
The ads in mine

Would I love the same stuff
falling off the encoded end
white spots on a black surface
black spots on a white surface

I love my daughter still
but would I love her the same
If I take a different measure
in traversing my purchase

If I take some different measure
talking into pheasants bending themselves
The long time I had a vision
without the long time I was accounting

Where I take my liesure
I take it out in the snow fall
What would I feel without that goal
What would I feel without a goal

Would I love the same
Undoubtedly 
But would I love her the same
there was no walking along the pleasure

promoting from home to a new job
there was no walking along
no solid ground to continue along

What I do in my liesure

I resume unassimilable visions
I reuse indelible tracks 
The first language
The first falling syllable

that I can hear
The first track
encoded off the end
First language

The first track 
hauling off the end of the world
may not be ingrained
but they are black spots

all that I can think I want
may not be engrained
as far back as my history heard
What was the last time

I reuse indelible tracks
I can hear them between bills and stuff
eroded off the end
Tomorrow 

falling off the end of the world
The first syllable 
I even know what I would find
I believe I can prepare for it

White spots on a black surface
will not be the same
that I hear without trying
falling off the end of the word

in the time
actually considering the end
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I refuse indelible tracts
I refuse indelible tracks
I refuse indelible contracts
All that I can think I want

not many face up
On the other hand
I need the work
though not many freeze up

explicit statements
up in the television pleasure
though not many facts up in the sky
until I could not tire 

I resume indelible tracks
wrapped in static and explicit statements
I cannot clear it also through investiture
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

wrapped in static implicit statements
I need an explicit statement
though as for conversing
up in the television

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
but I can hear them
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

there was no television to hear
I cannot hear it between bills

which I needed for an explicit state
The sun high enough to enter directly 
over the roof of the buildings across the alley
So I look up and don’t walk any

it was not just a defeat
A defeated

Toward the start informally given my reasons

So I work and don’t look any

Then I saw them interview
You need history

flattening my reception
while we’re wrapped in static

until I purpose the horizon

I watch a movie
in the sense of sleep
of my purpose in versing
versing my circuit

I get through there
in versing my surfeit
of my purpose in conversing

they were on
I could in effect credit

and hold and wish to hold
I could effect credit

in the long time they were on

I have them lost
I have them trust in me
I swayed a little in my state
reflexing indented in my phone

in traversing my circuit
in pursuit of the sight
that will spur me on
in conversing of my purpose

that will try me on 
even when close to my owning
I get from here through there
I get here through there

even when close to my knowing
in pursuing my purpose
I came back to me
I captured an afterimage

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
I watch a moving afterimage
without ensuing damage
I came after my past

under the last seen principle
in traversing get through there
get from here through there
In conversing of my purpose

I continue to presume
attributable visions
attributable decisions
in traversing my purpose

visions that can be attributable
having been graspable
that can be attributable
decisions that can be attributable

if I take a different measure
of attributable visions
I continue to subsume
I continue to consume

even when closed
When closed to my knowing
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
a futile joyous white sun

I shivered looking up
I see you knitting uproars with a bow
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

here is the site of the battle of maldon
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Under the last seen principle
Under the grass principle

having been an ungraspable time
Then I continue to dream then
I could consume the dream
missing words

I continue to consume 
Then I continued to dream then
Then I continued to dream

With a fervor 
that I saw

Under the last principle of purchasing power

And we had to say goodbye to her there

Up in the sky
for an ungraspable purchase
My purpose up in the sky
Sweets and coffee and juice

For an ungraspable time
articles all around us
under the grasp principle
Under the past prinicple

We had to say goodbye there
If articles can storm in excess

Articles all around stores in surfeit

under the grass principle
Under the past principle
Articles all around storming around

Sweets and coffee
 and juice

We had to buy there
And need out in front purchase
Under the last principle
And read out in front

Even the children
Until my purpose 
For an ungraspable purchase
up in the sky

Even my child
 of those gathered
She lay under the grass
And from a weak distance

where I need gravity
I tell you my purposes
And for an ungraspable time
they can be waived

I have supporters
While they’re up in the sky
I tell you the weight of my purchases
until I purpose up in the sky

my purchase up in the sky
until I purchase up in the sky
Or in some imaginary elsewhere
While we’re up in the sky 

And reached up the screen
– Rosmarie Waldrop
I wear suspenders
And from that great distance

around the dogs and lillies
I spin around
around 
I spin around 

unnerving my wing
I let it remind me again
Where I lead gravity
I used my technology

until I purchase up the sky
having supporters 
suspenders
that hold and wish to hold

designed 
And from a great distance
my purpose up in the sky
all the spots

to catch the spots
I spun around trying to touch the spots
There are spots waiting
until my purchase up in the sky

my purchse up in the sky
or in some imaginary elsewhere
I click my zipcode up where it should be down
They can be waived

They can be weighed
I tell you the weight of my purposes
weight of my purposes
Is the weight of my purchases

Is the weight of my click or zipcode
Where I need gravity
I click or my zipcode
One was up where it should be down

I tell you where I need gravity
missing words 
without consumer damage
that nothing had gravity

My means without gravity
I capture an afterimage
without longer damage
so that nothing had gravity

That I captured an afterimage
to any consumer damage
I continued to dream then
until the bill came

without any longer damage
As a clone, illegally conceived
full of the missing words
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
some sort of a futile joyous white sun
Not even a [blank] would elect to be
The day

we had inhabited actually
and we could inhabit the room easy
or alter of course the time anyway
Though we are waiting for her

between that day
already formerly a long time
to the ends of my transactions
I have a memory between the day

We had inhabited actually
And we could inhabit the room easy
Or alter of course the time anyway
Where in me did I host

in the form filled offered in trust
washed by my memory
I designated 
in the space that it had

worn as it was designed
and to which I’ve agreed
all parties would be held
by my memory

I thought
I assumed 
dawn already formerly nights 
formerly a long time they were on

and literally moved
without really agreeing
if there is anything 
to ask in advance

if that has anything
