[That is itself not still, That is itself not still]

But that is beside the point
That is itself not still

Rather it itself is rotating
not rotating

russling to stay still
What does it mean to drift

to the pillow
out in the snow

The sun shielding 
out in the snow 

What the next step
What’s the next step

The next step 
not goals

What was the last time
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

Though it is not many simple acts
Though it is not a simple act

though it is not a simple act
that I saw

not speaking
myself

when it is not literal
and it’s not literal

about the site hosting
so still them

so still washed
 still carefully

In my heart did I lose trust
that this is possible
