[after, by, which, from]

after having been contented
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
which is the long time I was on
I get from here through there

I captured an afterimage
we had to say goodbye
and to which I’ve agreed
breaking from my constituents

after though there’s no memory
that is by possessed
which as tracked befitted 
from no one point

that having been after content
speech that is of by prospects
which as tracked befitted
