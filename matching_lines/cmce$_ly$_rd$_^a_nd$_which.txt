[ce$, ly$, rd$, ^a, nd$, which]

Then fall then summer from my face
I shake violently
But I canâ€™t let myself disregard
and not falling at all
Coffe and
which I brought down with qualities

To that impossible place
Eventually
as far back as my history heard
all that I can think I want
eroded off the end
which I needed for an explicit state

attesting this is a chance
we had inhabited actually
