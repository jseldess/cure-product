[ere$, by, which, ere$]

The edge isn’t even there
by no ventillation my purpose
which can be pronounced 
I get through there

I get from here through there
we had to say goodbye
and to which I’ve agreed
firing and connecting somewhere

By my memory elsewhere
washed by my memory
which as tracked befitted 
by my memory elsewhere

in memory elsewhere
by my standing
 as points which are my interest
