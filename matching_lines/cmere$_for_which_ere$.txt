[ere$, for, which, ere$]

The edge isn’t even there
for how can you know without direction
which can be pronounced 
I get through there

I get from here through there
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
and to which I’ve agreed
firing and connecting somewhere

By my memory elsewhere
which I feel formerly about for
which as tracked befitted 
by my memory elsewhere

in memory elsewhere
but for memory elsewhere
 as points which are my interest
