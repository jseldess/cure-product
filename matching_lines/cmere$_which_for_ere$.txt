[ere$, which, for, ere$]

The edge isn’t even there
which can be pronounced 
to be before the sun
I get through there

I get from here through there
and to which I’ve agreed
Though we are waiting for her
firing and connecting somewhere

By my memory elsewhere
which I feel formerly about for
in the form filled offered must
by my memory elsewhere

in memory elsewhere
 as points which are my interest 
for my own purposes
