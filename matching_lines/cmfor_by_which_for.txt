[for, by, which, for]

Before we walk across the wide field
by no ventillation my purpose
which can be pronounced 
to be before the sun

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
upset by Gingrich
which I brought down with qualities
hold at intervals riding forward

at intervals while riding forward
I am told by no ventillation
from which to step off
that potential is there for you

I believe I can prepare for it
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
which is the long time I was on
without accounting for credit

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
we had to say goodbye
and to which I’ve agreed
Though we are waiting for her

already formerly a long time
Um, upset by Gingrich
which we can pronounce
the impulse for my own prospects

the impulse for my own purposes
A baby and a bear
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
found dated for my own purchases

sound inundated for my own purchases
Elsewhere by my memory
which ran to be told
for not paying redundant

for not paying sound overwhelmed
by my memory
which as tracked befitted 
in the form filled offered in trust

dawn already formerly nights 
washed by my memory
and to which the plan agreed
and for which the plan agreed

which feels most comfortable
by my memory 
which I feel formerly about for
in the form filled offered must

in the form filled offered trust 
that is by possessed
which as tracked befitted  
phase decision for learning

for learning by the prospect
step by into the prospect
which as tracked befitted
a precision for learning

sizes track for asking sound
that is by I am possessed
which as 
for my own purchases

impulse for my own purchases
by my memory elsewhere
 as points which are my interest 
for my own purposes

own best form
by the private preambles
which as tracked befitted phased
sizes asking for tracking sound

for a while to listen already
