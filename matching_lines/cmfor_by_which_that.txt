Before we walk across the wide field
by no ventillation my purpose
which can be pronounced 
though it was most emphatically that

for not voting for him
upset by Gingrich
which I brought down with qualities
To that impossible place

to be before the sun
I am told by no ventillation
from which to step off
that potential is there for you

I believe I can prepare for it
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
which is the long time I was on
that having been after content

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
we had to say goodbye
and to which I’ve agreed
if that has anything

the impulse for my own prospects
A baby and a bear
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
in the space that it had

already formely a long time
by my memory
which as tracked befitted 
and that man comes on to tell me 

in the form filled offered in trust
Elsewhere by my memory
which feels more comfortable
in the face that it had

washed by my memory
which I feel formerly about for
that is by possessed

forgetting decisions

which as tracked befitted  
we ask say in that case

phase decision for learning
for learning by the prospect
which as tracked befitted
I ask say in that case 

a precision for learning
step by into the prospect
which as

own best form
by the private preambles
which as tracked befitted phased
I ask say in that phase decisioned

sizes track for asking sound
that is by I am possessed
which is not necessarily possible
revisions that can be attributable

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
