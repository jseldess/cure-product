[ld$, a$, a$, ed$]

off the edge of the world
Iâ€™ll pull my data
The days of private data
The days were long aligned

off the end of the world
The days of public data
The days of parsing data
may not be ingrained

falling off the end of the world
I end up in Bach and Selma
my interfaced stand data
I interfaced
