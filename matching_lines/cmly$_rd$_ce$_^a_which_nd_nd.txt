I’ll get there eventually
But I can’t let myself disregard
Falling from this distance
and not falling at all
which can be pronounced 
Then blue and sun again a second, then night
into a brigand and a murderer

nor work in this way daily
hold at intervals riding forward
To that impossible place
available
from which to step off
And as an extension of the values
I hear it between bills and stuff

we had inhabited actually
