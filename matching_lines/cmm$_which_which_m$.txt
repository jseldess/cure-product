[m$, which, which, m$]

You should ask who I am
which can be pronounced 
which I brought down with qualities
in a continuous vertiginous dream

from where I can claim
from which to step off
which I needed for an explicit state
the opacity given to them

I could consume the dream
and to which I’ve agreed
which we can pronounce
I speak to them

the point where I am
which ran to be told
which had on honor to be told
I literally move them

pre-worn and still wash them
which I feel formerly about for
which as tracked befitted 
I learned the point where I am

I can’t remember them
which as tracked befitted  
which is not necessarily possible
the people in home form

the people in own form
which as tracked befitted
which as tracked befitted phased
before I act on them
