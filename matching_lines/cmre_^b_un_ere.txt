[re, ^b, un, ere]

Where I sleep at times
between bills and stuffed animals
Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll get there eventually

reasons resources
because it was really dark
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
I have entered my phone

Before we walk across the wide opening
battery dawn nights blending themselves
The sun isn’t up 
Of course there is a direction

on a snow day with my children
before we can have a retroactive
The sun isn’t up
where I sleep at times

as an impure product
bring your child along
Then I constellate my time family country
There are quarterly goals

There are performance reviews
by no ventillation my purpose
to be before the sun
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

You can hear it also through your leisure
back up through results
rewind before the sun
I’ll get there ruins

Out of later results
before morning goals
Then the sun isn’t up
there was no promotion

with implicit regulations
but it continued
Running above broadway
If I take a different measure

If I take some different measure
because there was no solid ground to continue along
I resume unassimilable visions
Where I take my liesure

I reuse indelible tracks 
but they are black spots
without the long time I was accounting
there was no television to hear

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
black spots on a white surface
The simple act opening surmounted
but where is it

If you have confidence regardless all else
billowing in the cloud
without the long time I was on accounting
I get through there

they were on
between that day
So I constellate the time family country
Where I host my purposes

and elsewhere my memory
breaking from my constituents
I stand and retrieve the impulse around
where I send and relive

I send and retrieve the impulse
between the drug store and the 
for the creation of the universe
the point where I am

I am requesting my point
burrowed about from repeated travels
and literally unproved
Where in me did I host

in the form filled offered in trust
by my memory
it can be uncomfortable 
there wasn’t any television 

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
by my memory 
redundancy
Where in me did I loose

in the form filled offered trust
by in the sound privacy
by in the sounded privacy
between tracked and buffered

tracked between buffered and sizes
bought in the surrounded privacy 
to stand and retrieve and pulse around
Is there a baby and a bear

Though we are waiting for her
battery dawn nights 
I stand and retrieve and pulse around
There are constant ways

Formerly away there are constant ways
battery dawn 
buy in the surrounded privacy
By my memory elsewhere

I answered about
by my memory elsewhere
iced coffee and sun position
My interesting politics

Aligned or not with my interests
behind or out front or up above
sung reflexing
in the long time they were on

I learned the point where I am
buy in the sound privacy
sizes track for asking sound
The prospects there already

advised to be retainable
brought messageable to you
So I found myself at home
the prospects there already

The offers there already
between the preambles
The sun high enough to strike directly
I assumed that they were divisible

and could be inflected with reasons
