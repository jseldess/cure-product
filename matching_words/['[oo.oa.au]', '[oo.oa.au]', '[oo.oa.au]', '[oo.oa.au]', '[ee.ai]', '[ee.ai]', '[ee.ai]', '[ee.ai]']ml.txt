Arrayed
Ask who I am to suspend
I am to end my connections suspended live
Arrayed out in such a nested way
I intend my connections
But that is beside the point
Where I sleep at times
I suspend live connections to you

I upend my connections to you
I upend live connections to you
I intend my connections to you
You should ask who I am
Whereas direction is beside the point
I suspend my connections to you
The dogs and lillies
I step off the edge

I assumed it was visible
into rotating directionless 
into the stream of pictures
into the minority proportion of time
The sun isn’t up 
Ask who I am
We’ll have coffee this morning
I intend my live connections to you

My live connections to you
Ask who I am to end my live connection
Suspended live in connections to you
So I presume the offers already

So I find myself at home
already brought into privacy
The prospects there already

between bills and stuffed animals
brought messageable to you
by the private preambles
Then I cannot see face value
Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type
off the edge of the world
On a snow day with my children

Before we walk across the wide field
variegated reflected light
I’ll get there eventually
Then I constellate my time family country

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

No! 
as pure as my children
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
I told her a story, she drew waves.
So I went back to sleep
because it was really dark
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

What is an impure product
When I woke up in the morning
it was really sunny
too sunny to eat ice cream

Then fall then summer from my face
my children’s consumption
not calling or echoing for once
I have entered my phone
Before we walk across the wide opening
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
who knows the way
stopped light with validated variegated fields

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
In a sharp downard turn
I shake violently 
and not falling at all
Falling from this distance
Falling from my face
Face falling off the edge of the face

value falling off the edge of the face
about my children’s consumption
Then fall then summer
I reach repeated expressions first
In the retroactive light
of retroactive observations
such as I see
such as I can see

It keeps coming down thankfully
In the light of retroactive conversations
conversations with our purchase
as far as I can see
Before anyone walks across the wide opening
In the light of retroactive
conversations with our reactions
conversations with our feelings

Of course there is a direction
When I want something
before we can have a retroactive
conversation with our feelings
in light of learning what we see
I want to find a way to block it incoming
I propogated repeated expressions first
Before anyone buys up the opening

I want to find a way to block it
skin smile repeated expressions
I want to find a way to block incoming
smile testing glance repeated expressions
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
By being so concerned
All of the time
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
I can find a way to block it incoming
if not directly on my skin
One day there is direction
interjecting on a day ambition
Before anyone walks across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the opening
I can find a way to block incoming 

I can find a way to block it in the incoming stream
than in the incoming stream
I can find a way to block it
That’s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field
from the incoming stream
of not directly from my skin
as long as I have access to the code

or the incoming stream
and at my desk
love of breadth
especially in a child
interjecting on a day there will be ambition
only fragments of time with my children
on a day there will be direction
interjecting into the stream

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
interjecting into the stream of pictures
One day was actually
Though there are quarters goals
They’re just not mine
Actually one day there is direction
Put in place as stationary destinations
how can I know without direction

for how can I know without direction
The edge is put in place
Stationary destination
That is itself not still
As though stationary and a destination
The edge isn’t even there
Rather it itself is rotating
And put in place as though stationary

in rotating directionless space
wrestling to stay still
not rotating
wrestling me to stay still
russling to stay still
I can’t fix them without direction
there are quarters 
We can wrestle them with their goals

We can rest there in them with their goals
into rotating and directionless space
with goals
Though how can you know without direction
I step over the edge
though there are quarters with goals
with goals I find there
If I step on the edge

and then into rotating and directional space
or not even rotating
for how can you know without direction
If I step over the edge
into directionless space

That’s when they really take
hold at intervals riding forward
Looking back while I should be sleeping
at intervals while riding forward

In a continuous theme
I logged in
I put my bread down

I brought my count down
I put my head down

could map to the dimnsions of a graph

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

What would I feel without a goal
Would I love the same

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
As a clone, illegally conceived
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
here is the site of the battle of maldon
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Under the grass principle

Then I continue to dream then
I could consume the dream

Then I continued to dream then
Then I continued to dream

Under the last principle of purchasing power

And we had to say goodbye to her there
she lay under the grass

For an ungraspable time
Under the past prinicple

We had to say goodbye there
If articles can storm in excess

And read out in front

Until my purpose

And for an ungraspable time
they can be waived

While they’re up in the sky

And from that great distance
around the dogs and lillies
I spin around
around 
unnerving my wing
I let it remind me again
Where I lead gravity
while consuming damage

I used my technology
I continued to dream then
until I purchase up the sky
designed to hold up my underwear
I designed them to hold up my underwear
having supporters 
suspenders
that hold and wish to hold

And from a great distance
until I purchase the sky
all the spots
to catch the spots
I spun around trying to touch the spots
There are spots waiting
until my purchase up in the sky
my purchse up in the sky

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I click or my zipcode
They can be weighed
One was up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes
weight of my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity
Is the weight of my purchases

Is the weight of my click or zipcode
without consumer damage
that nothing had gravity
My means without gravity
I capture an afterimage
without longer damage
so that nothing had gravity
That I captured an afterimage

without any further damage
to any consumer damage
until the bill came
without any longer damage
full of the missing words
that of the man with the dyed blond hair
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

the resemblance

which feels most comfortable
when it is not literal
Though we are waiting 
without really binding
I move
I literally moved

when I move
and it’s not literal
it can be uncomfortable 
I speak to them my possessions
and move them literally with me
I literally move them
without their agreement
literally move
