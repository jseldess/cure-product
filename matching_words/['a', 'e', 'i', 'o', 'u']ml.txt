Arrayed
Ask who I am to suspend
I am to end my connections suspended live
Arrayed out in such a nested way
But that is beside the point

Where I sleep at times
I suspend live connections to you
I upend my connections to you
I intend my connections
I upend live connections to you

You should ask who I am
Whereas direction is beside the point
I suspend my connections to you
The dogs and lillies
I assumed it was visible

into rotating directionless 
into the stream of pictures
into the minority proportion of time
Ask who I am
I intend my live connections to you

Ask who I am to end my live connection
Suspended live in connections to you
The sun isn’t up 
So I presume the offers already

So I find myself at home

Then I cannot see face value

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?
as pure as my children
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
I step off the edge
because it was really dark

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

What is an impure product

When I woke up in the morning
it was really sunny

too sunny to eat ice cream
So I went back to sleep
Because it was really dark
Then fall then summer from my face

I have entered my phone
Before we walk across the wide opening

In a sharp downard turn

I shake violently 
Falling from this distance
Falling from my face

Then fall then summer
I reach repeated expressions first
In the retroactive light

such as I can see
It keeps coming down thankfully
In the light of retroactive conversations

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
In the light of retroactive 
In the light of retroactive

Of course there is a direction
When I want something
before we can have a retroactive
conversation with our feelings
Before anyone buys up the opening

I want to find a way to block it

I want to find a way to block incoming

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

I can find a way to block it incoming

One day there is direction
interjecting on a day ambition
interjecting into the stream of pictures

and at my desk
love of breadth
especially in a child
On a day there will be direction
One day was actually

Though there are quarters goals
They’re just not mine
Actually one day there is direction
Though there are quarters goals 
Put in place as stationary destinations

how can I know without direction
for how can I know without direction
The edge is put in place
Stationary destination
As though stationary and a destination

Rather it itself is rotating
And put in place as though stationary
in rotating directionless space
wrestling to stay still
russling to stay still

I can’t fix them without direction
there are quarters 
We can wrestle them with their goals
We can rest there in them with their goals
Though how can you know without direction

With goals 
I step over the edge
into rotating and directionless space
though there are quarters with goals
for how can you know without direction

into directionless space
not even rotating

drifting does not feel an exception
You can hear it also through your leisure
Which is a measure to never live out

and can’t presume to need
But I can’t let myself treat 
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
Then I can’t presume to feed others
at any time it can drift again
Without a proposed budget
Without a head

In a vertiginous dream
I keep turning back again myself
I brought my qualities down
While I should be sleeping
I brought my head down

and my heart rate
Where official policy is to catch and release
A turtle fished out of the lake
The leaves curdled on the tree out front
Some disease effecting the tree out front

fish pulled out of the lake
in a continuous vertiginous dream
of later ruins
Out of remnant pages
Out of the remnant ruins

and my heartrate
of later results
Out of the back page ruins
low in the content architecture
Where I put it beating

Out of the remnants 
of later pages
Ruins results
Out of the remnant pages
Out of the remnant pages of later ruins

Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
A person from a distance
But not to me directly
Or the company
Spinning around the heart

the dogs and lillies
While I should be sleeping 
You use the most essential parts
Even before the lesson starts
Even before the skills aquired

When they really take hold of my finger
I search with my head
hold at intervals riding forward
Looking back while I should be sleeping
which I brought down with qualities

In a continuous theme
I logged in
I wish my desires were open
and could be mapped and weighed
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

On the bandwidth I was on
and the graph ahead of me
I keep turning back
I log in and search with my head
impulse control

at intervals while riding forward
with my head
a similar desire against me
not back in the results
While I should sleep not back in the results

Remnant continuous pages
Back in the results pages
remnant continuous pages
I put my bread down
I brought my count down

I put my head down
Back up through the results
I was advised to rewind
back up through results
higher up in the results

So I was advised to back up
rewind before the sun
So I was advised to rewind
Back up before the sun
back up the results

back up through the results
back up before the results
I was enjoined to act again
So I was enjoined to rewind
before the sun’s deflections

To that impossible place
Higher up in the results
I’ll get there ruins
Out of later results
Eventually

Out of remnant pages 
I’ll get there ruins 
of later pages ruins results
Out of the remnants of later pages
results

out of the remnant ruins
out of the back page ruins
high in the content architecture
out from below the fold
out of the fifth page ruins

where I can lay claim to ruins
hovering above standing water
high up in the architecture
where I can claim to see the ruins
to see the ruins

from where I can claim to see the mosquitos
emerging this year from too much standing water
to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water
to see the patterns on the birds
to see the sunrise

high up in the content architecture
I had me a vision
there was no promotion
tomorrow
I hear it between bills and stuff

On the timeline I was on
The timeline

Forecasting the story before dawn
The sun shielding

Booked with a meeting

After having been contented
out in the snow
over the long time I was on
before morning goals
barely outlines

and email
learned without too much difficulty to code
Having transitioned from leisure to work
I am told by the ventillation
The ventillation rushes on

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
Strategy comes before morning
Before morning goals
after having been contented
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Its strategy comes before morning goals
but the sun isn’t up
It’s morning 
Strategy comes before goals
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

I just got a letter
It’s the third letter from the end
The third letter from the end is mine
I see only the back of falling values
blue and sun again a second, then night

The planning process for visions
upsent in the afternoon
of my economic value
I see the back of the planning process
I see the back of falling values

I can see only values falling back
an upsent afternoon
out in the snow 
I see only the back
then I cannot see face value

What the next step
is pressing
I see only the back of my habits
of the habits I create
I can see only the back of falling values

is passing
out in the snow fall
out in the snow falling face value
then I can see only the back of values
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I argued the days felt longer
and testing the edge and gravity
The planning process is for visionaries only
and strategies not tactics
of the economic value my habits

the planning process for decisions
Aspirational strategy
I am not allowed to see their face
of the economic value
then I can see only the back values

of the habits they create
I can see only the back of their economic value
Their economic value
That you can see only the back of
increasingly that their economic value

is a function of the strength
That can’t be glimpsed
in front of the set afternoon
their economic value
and key value

and key value pairs
with key value pairs
with four key value pairs
with implicit regulations
in a regulated climate

in front of the set of regulations
with internally regulated climate
into the well controlled climate
I tried to feel the extension of key values
when trying to feel the extension of key values

the strength of the habits
they create
Companies increasingly find 
that their economic value 
is a function of the strength 

of the habits they create.

Not goals or tactics
They are called aspirational
your bid to the next highest ranked network

I am bid to act again
I argued the days were longer

I was enjoying acting against myself
I was enjoined to act
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
off the end of the world
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

I agrued the days were longer
when watching tv
The entire company
aspirating with visions
but it continued

I am enjoined to act again
off the end myself
I was bid to act again myself
I was big to act again
or argued for them at least

The days aligned for company
The days long aligned
since I can imagine movement
I am full of potential
with full potential to movement

since you can imagine movement
The days are long
with little reason to move
across the retinas
I argued that the days were longer

my associations
with little reasons to aspiration
with little reasons to move
embodied with little reason
I had nightmares though

that I was the arm of this
The days were long
There was very little physical activity
aside from the retinas
full of aspirations

embodied with little aspirations
little visions
full of potential
The days were long aligned
The days of public quantity

The days of private data
The days of parsing data
That company creates a life
Life is with people
So stay with us

aspirating with little visions
I aspirate with little vision
with little reason to aspiration
embodied aspirations
As an extension of the values

that potential is there for you
I had to tell them the news
but it continued rippling muscle
from which to step off
The days of quantity 

The days of public data

Running above broadway
Would I love the same stuff

falling off the encoded end
white spots on a black surface
black spots on a white surface
I love my daughter still
but would I love her the same

If I take a different measure
in traversing my purchase
If I take some different measure
What I do in my liesure
I reuse unassimilable visions

talking into pheasants bending themselves
The long time I had a vision
without the long time I was accounting
I take it out in the snow fall
I can hear it between bills and stuff

What would I feel without that goal
What would I feel without a goal
there was no walking along the pleasure
promoting from home to a new job
no solid ground to continue along

there was no walking along
promoting from home
and continue along having

than solid ground

because there was no solid ground to continue along
from home
walking along the measure
walking from home along the measure
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

– Macbeth
I resume unassimilable visions
I reuse indelible tracks 
falling off the end
First language

The first falling syllable
that I can hear
The first track 
hauling off the end of the world
The first language

may not be ingrained
but they are black spots
all that I can think I want
may not be engrained
I reuse indelible tracks

I can hear them between bills and stuff
Where I take my liesure
The first track
falling off the end of the world
I even know what I would find

I believe I can prepare for it
White spots on a black surface
will not be the same
will no be ingrainded 
that I hear without trying

falling off the end of the word
in the time
actually considering the end
encoded off the end
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

as far back as my history heard
I cannot clear it also through divestiture
What was the last time
I refuse indelible contracts
not many face up

On the other hand
I need the work
explicit statements
up in the television pleasure
though not many facts up in the sky

I resume indelible tracks
wrapped in static and explicit statements
I cannot clear it also through investiture
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
though as for conversing

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
up in the television
until I could not tire 
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
I cannot hear it between bills
and stuff up in the sky
Though in not many acts
Though in not many acts up in the sky

though in not many acts up in the sky
Though it is not many simple acts
not the simple act
Though it is not a simple act
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

in the simple act of reading
Can I clear it through emphatic seizure
Between bills and stuffed animals
though it is not a simple act
You can clear it also through static seizure

The simple act opening surmounted
The simple act of opening surmounted
the simple act of honoring an accountant
of honoring surmounted
the simple act of opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
in the simple act of opening a book
in the simple act of opening an accountant
You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
You can clear it also through static siezure

You can hear it also through static leisure
You can clear it also through static leisure
I resume attributable visions
until I could not tire
until I could not be tired

I need an explicit statement
while wrapped in static
which I needed for an explicit state
The sun high enough to enter directly 
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

I walk up and don’t work anymore
it was not just a defeat
advancing the time
Toward the start informally given my reasons
around my country 

Then I saw into you
Then I saw them interview
attesting this is a chance
You need history
you need history

The long time I was a vision
flattening my reception
while we’re wrapped in static
for as far back as my history
until I could not be hired

I had a vision
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
like flattening sleep 
like state mirror
like un

I enter the flattening mirror
under pillowing a cloud
under pillowing a loud 
the cloud
billowing in the cloud

without the long time I was on accounting
without accounting the long time I was on
which is the long time I was on
without accounting for credit
of my purpose in versing

in the sense of watching
which is all the time
the long time I was on
they were on
I could in effect credit

and hold and wish to hold
I could effect credit
in traversing my purpose
I get through there
in versing my surfeit

an irretrievable advantage
in the long time they were on
I have them trust in me
that having been after content
in traversing my circuit

that will spur me on
in conversing of my purpose
in pursuing my purpose
in pursuit of the sight
of my purpose in conversing

I came back to me
I captured an afterimage
I watch a movie
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
without ensuing damage

I came after my past
under the last seen principle
in traversing get through there
get from here through there
In conversing of my purpose

attributable visions
attributable decisions
visions that can be attributable
decisions that can be attributable
I continue to presume

if I take a different measure
of attributable visions
versing my circuit
I continue to subsume
I continue to consume

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
a futile joyous white sun
I shivered looking up
I see you knitting uproars with a bow
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Under the last seen principle
Under the grass principle
having been an ungraspable time
I watch a moving afterimage
Then I continue to dream then

I could consume the dream
I continue to consume 
Then I continued to dream then
missing words
Then I continued to dream

purchased out
Under the grasp principle
having been purchased out
With a fervor 
having been purchased out 

that I saw
having been purchased out of you
Under the last principle 
Articles all around us
Having been purchased out of you

we had to say goodbye
Under the last principle of purchasing power
even my child
for an ungraspable purchase
My purpose up in the sky

Sweets and coffee and juice
For an ungraspable time
articles all around us
We had to say goodbye there
articles all around storming around

Articles all around stores in surfeit
storing in surfeit
under the grasp principle
Articles all around storming around
abundance

absence glut
Sweets and coffee
 and juice
We had to buy there
And need out in front purchase

Under the last principle
Under the past principle
And read out in front
Until my purpose 
For an ungraspable purchase

 of those gathered
She lay under the grass
And from a weak distance
I tell you my purposes
And for an ungraspable time

they can be waived
I have supporters
While they’re up in the sky
I tell you the weight of my purchases
until I purpose up in the sky

my purchase up in the sky
until I purchase up in the sky
Or in some imaginary elsewhere
there wasn’t any television 
I wear suspenders

where I need gravity
And reached up the screen
And from that great distance
around the dogs and lillies
I spin around

around 
unnerving my wing
I let it remind me again
while consuming damage
I used my technology

I continued to dream then
until I purchase up the sky
I spin around 
designed to hold up my underwear
I designed them to hold up my underwear

having supporters 
suspenders
that hold and wish to hold
And from a great distance
While we’re up in the sky

until I purchase the sky
all the spots
I spun around trying to touch the spots
There are spots waiting
until my purchase up in the sky

or in some imaginary elsewhere
I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I click or my zipcode
One was up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes

They can be waived
weight of my purposes
They can be weighed
I tell you where I need gravity
Is the weight of my purchases

Where I need gravity
Is the weight of my click or zipcode
missing words 
without consumer damage
My means without gravity

I capture an afterimage
without longer damage
so that nothing had gravity
without any further damage
to any consumer damage

until the bill came
That I captured an afterimage
without any longer damage
As a clone, illegally conceived
full of the missing words

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
that of the man with the dyed blond hair
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

Not even a [blank] would elect to be

Though we are waiting for her

with her ways to the ends
to stand and retrieve and pulse around
Bach helps turn it off
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

Selma helps too
Though we can’t help waiting
with her way to the ends
Though we can’t help waiting for her
My daughter helps too

My daughter turns it off too
the way that I was going
He has turned it off
I have turned it off
I end up in Bach

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
to the other end of actions
actions
to the other end battery dawn 
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

with constant ways 
the other end transactions
Formerly a way like this one
To the ends of my transactions
Who throws contours away

who throws contours a way
There are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this
who knows the way
The contours exchange with you

the contours exchange with you
to their other contours
with no constant ways 
who know the ways to their other end
and end up in Bach

There are no constant ways
To the other end of my actions
To the other end of transactions like this
with no way
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

the other end of actions
The other end of means
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
Formerly away there are constant ways
I end up Bach forty-one seconds in

with constant ways to the other end
Forty-one seconds in
A way I was going
formerly a way
to the other end of my purpose

I end up in Bach with no way 
to the other end of transactions
of my actions
and have no way
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

on Bach
on the other end
shone formerly a long time
formerly my way to the elections
I answered what I thought

on a way to the elections
formally a way to the elections
formerly along my say to the elections
dawn formerly rights ended themselves
I assumed what I draw

Having seen more than 
I speak them of my possessions
speech my possession of my children
forgetting decisions 
But my feeling the memory aside

firing and connecting somewhere
along cables
in my increased capacity
mostly along cables
the least productive of myself

the least instructive of myself
where I am aside
where I’m watching my tv
at least instructive of myself
at least for the duration of the answer

recalling aside
joined in my television
joined in my wasting vision
also didn’t really move
my daughter’s squirrel and chickadee joined me

my interfaced stand data
Aligned or not with my interests
battery dawn nights blending themselves
by my memory elsewhere
radiating from housing

and persisting and replicating
shone from the housing
reflexing indented in my phone
but for memory elsewhere
I answered what I thought about

battery dawn nights ending themselves
but standing in memory
shone formerly along time
dawn formerly rights lended themselves
about 

 as points which are my interest 
in welfare and hope
in
iced coffee and sun position
I return not sad exactly

not literally moved
for my own purposes
Not literally moved
I stay the right of my elections
to the right of a surcharge

abjure them with determining 
I stay the right of my possessions 
aligned or not with my interests
I returned not sad exactly
The right of incurred elections

to return what I bought
the right of possessions
in the fill space 
behind or out front or up above
out front

waiting out front or up above 
in the space out front
waiting out front or up above or behind
in the fill space out front
sung reflexing

the right of surcharge
and advantaged irretrievably
at the site of a purchase
I returned to location
as the right of a surcharge

I have them lost
I swayed a little in my state
I learned my point
I learned the point where I am
requesting my standing

I learned my location
I returned
the right of a surcharge
passwords 
lung reflexing

state kept moaned impression
My state kept loaned impression
The weight kept moaned impression
my reflexing indented in my own tongue
tongue reflexing

in my state
reflexing indented in my own
in my
state indented in my own
the tongue and hands

into an oral
the young ripples inaudibly
the void kept owned impression
My void
buy in the sound privacy

phrase them of our possessions
phrase them
possessions
people
I assume the offers reliable

and maybe regrettable 
in that I cannot remember 
I assume the offers revisitable
I assume the offers divisible
and could be inflected with reasons

and came home to rewind
stopping in the middle
which is not necessarily possible
The prospects there already
own best form to ourselves

that agreed one best
home stays brought loyal
the people in home form
ensure to ourselves
and our 

that agreed to one the people
posterity
the people in own form
more to ourselves insure
form to more ourselves

inure tranquility
that agreed home to people
the people in form own
own stays bought loyal
bought stays own loyal

We ask say in that case
we ask say in that case
step in by the prospect
phase decisioned by the prospect
bills and stuffed animals

visions that can be attainable
advised to be retainable
revisions that can be attributable
revised to be attainable
So I found myself at home

the prospects there already
the prospects being seen by me
The prospects being seen by me
The offers there already
at home brought into private

The prospect of seeing healthily 
between the preambles
stepping in the middle
stepping off into the middle
So I resume the offers already

at home visions can be attainable
I offer to you
that this is possible
So I presume the offers
So I presume the offers at home already

brought messageable into privacy
brought into private messageably
brought into privacy
for a while to listen 
I resume the offers at home

in privacy that is messageable
I resume at home
for a while not to listen
presume the offers at 
I presume the offers

in that all this in private is messageable
For a while I think I don’t listen
traffick is there nonetheless
The prospect for careening attached
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
converting sight
in that decisions can be attributable
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
The sun high enough to strike directly

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
I assumed that they were divisible
stopping off in all directions
and come home to remind inflections
You can have seen offering

I assume possession to others
I presume to others 
in school and can see offering
remind in possessive terms
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

and maybe forgettable
forgettable
revisital
Or can have seen offering possession
