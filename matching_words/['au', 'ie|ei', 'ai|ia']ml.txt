['au', 'ie|ei', 'ai|ia']


because it was really dark
Before we walk across the wide field
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

I love my daughter still
What I do in my liesure
may not be ingrained

hauling off the end of the world
Can I clear it through emphatic seizure
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

with my daughter
to stand and retrieve and pulse around
Though we are waiting for her

My daughter helps too
I stand and retrieve and pulse around
not needing to wait

my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me
stopped light with validated fields
radiating from housing

the young ripples inaudibly
and advantaged irretrievably
I assume the offers reliable

my daughter will learn 
being seen by me
at home visions can be attainable
