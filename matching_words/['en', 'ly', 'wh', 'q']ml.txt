Ask who I am to suspend
I’ll get there eventually
where I sleep at times
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Between the face of pure joy and an interface.
it was really sunny
who knows the way
Though there are quarters goals

The edge isn’t even there
and is relentlessly budgeted
For whom drifting does not feel an exception
There are quarterly goals

And as an extension of the values
Then I constellate my time family country
That’s where I sleep at times
I brought my qualities down

Then I cannot see face value
But not to me directly
That’s when they really take
which I brought down with qualities

I wish my desires were open
When they really take hold of my finger
Looking back while I should be sleeping
from where I can claim to see the mosquitos

high up in the content architecture
Eventually
when trying to feel the extension of key values
The days of public quantity

full of potential
Undoubtedly 
from which to step off
I am requesting my point

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
would only willingly break
which ran to be told
Selma’s squirrel and chickadee

I had entered my phone
addition were filters formerly
I answered what I thought about
requesting my standing

that having been after content
and advantaged irretrievably
where the tongue rippled
inure tranquility

between tracked and buffered
if only on the way to the trash
for a while to listen already
