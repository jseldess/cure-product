Where I sleep at times

Whereas direction is beside the point

So I presume the offers already

The prospects there already

I’ll pull myself another personality type

I’ll get there eventually

where I sleep at times

I told her a story, she drew waves.

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

Then fall then summer from my face

I have entered my phone

battery dawn nights blending themselves

Then fall then summer

of retroactive observations

In the light of retroactive conversations

conversations with our purchase

conversations with our reactions

conversations with our feelings

Of course there is a direction

conversation with our feelings

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

By being so concerned

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

One day there is direction

interjecting on a day ambition

interjecting on a day there will be ambition

on a day there will be direction

interjecting into the stream

Daniel Tiger on a snow day

interferring 

interjecting into the stream of pictures

On a day there will be direction

Though there are quarters goals

Actually one day there is direction

Though there are quarters goals 

The edge isn’t even there

Rather it itself is rotating

there are quarters 

We can rest there in them with their goals

I step over the edge

though there are quarters with goals

with goals I find there

If I step over the edge

what I find there

others desires

Which is a measure to never live out

Then I can’t presume to need others

If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

over the long time up in the sky

There are quarterly goals

There are performance reviews

soft paper

here described

the latter

That’s where I sleep at times

Others desires as legitimate

way high up in the inter

I’ll pull my data higher up

and invaluable partner

higher up in the internet

I’ll pull myself higher up

high up in the internet

way high up in the internet

over the time line I was on

over the long line up in the sky

over the long line I would honor

After having been contented

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Which is a pleasure to never live out

I take hold of my finger

When we had jobs that were to earn

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

into a brigand and a murderer

To neither study

Referral or

Interrupted sleep or

In a vertiginous dream

Where official policy is to catch and release

in a continuous vertiginous dream

of later results

of later ruins

Where I put it beating

my desires were open

of later pages

Out of the remnants of later pages

Out of the remnant pages of later ruins

A person from a distance

dislocated and a person from a distance

When they really take hold of my finger

hold at intervals riding forward

at intervals while riding forward

I wish my desires were open

higher up in the results

Higher up in the results

out of later results

I’ll get there ruins

Out of later results

I’ll get there ruins 

of later pages ruins results

where I can lay claim to ruins

hovering above standing water

where I can claim to see the ruins

emerging this year from standing water

from where I can claim

from where I can claim to see the mosquitos

emerging this year from too much standing water

to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water

to see the patterns on the birds

there was no promotion

summer

over the long time I was on

after having been contented

that having been after content

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning

It’s the third letter from the end

The third letter from the end is mine

I just got a letter

upsent in the afternoon

an upsent afternoon

in front of the set afternoon

I argued the days felt longer

with internally regulated climate

oddly grown over with historic bark

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I argued the days were longer

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

I agrued the days were longer

The days were long

There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer

The days were long aligned

embodied everyday

that potential is there for you

I love my daughter still

but would I love her the same

If I take a different measure

in traversing my purchase

If I take some different measure

Where I take my liesure

But would I love her the same

there was no walking along the pleasure

there was no walking along

where you can earn more 

because there was no solid ground to continue along

there wasn’t any television 

eroded off the end

actually considering the end

On the other hand

though as for conversing

there was no television to hear

The sun high enough to enter directly 

over the roof of the buildings across the alley

but where is it

Then I saw them interview

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

talking into percents bending themselves

I enter the flattening mirror

under pillowing a cloud

under pillowing a loud 

walking into percents blending themselves

walking into percents

of my purpose in versing

versing my circuit

I get through there

in versing my surfeit

of my purpose in conversing

they were on

in traversing my purpose

in the long time they were on

in traversing my circuit

in conversing of my purpose

I get from here through there

I get here through there

I captured an afterimage

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

I watch a moving afterimage

I came after my past

under the last seen principle

in traversing get through there

get from here through there

In conversing of my purpose

if I take a different measure

I shivered looking up

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

here is the site of the battle of maldon

Under the last seen principle

Under the grass principle

Under the grasp principle

With a fervor 

Under the last principle 

Under the last principle of purchasing power

And we had to say goodbye to her there

she lay under the grass

of those gathered

under the grasp principle

Under the past prinicple

We had to say goodbye there

under the past principle

under the grass principle

Under the past principle

We had to buy there

Under the last principle

 of those gathered

She lay under the grass

where I need gravity

I have supporters

Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I wear suspenders

unnerving my wing

Where I lead gravity

designed to hold up my underwear

I designed them to hold up my underwear

having supporters 

suspenders

There are spots waiting

or in some imaginary elsewhere

I click my zipcode up where it should be down

One was up where it should be down

I tell you where I need gravity

Where I need gravity

without consumer damage

I capture an afterimage

without longer damage

That I captured an afterimage

without any further damage

to any consumer damage

without any longer damage

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

or alter of course the time anyway

Though we are waiting for her

already formerly a long time

Or alter of course the time anyway
