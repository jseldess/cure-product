at home brought into privacy

already brought into privacy

brought messageable to you

Then blue and sun again a second, then night

variegated reflected light

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

stopped light with validated variegated fields

battery dawn nights blending themselves

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light

In the retroactive light

In the light of retroactive conversations

In the light of retroactive

In the light of retroactive 

in light of learning what we see

Though there are quarters goals

Though there are quarters goals 

As though stationary and a destination

And put in place as though stationary

Though how can you know without direction

though there are quarters with goals

You can hear it also through your leisure

In the right sense

Right now I’m the cart

way high up in the inter

I’ll pull my data higher up

higher up in the internet

I’ll pull myself higher up

high up in the internet

way high up in the internet

though it was most emphatically that

I brought my head down

I brought my qualities down

which I brought down with qualities

I brought my count down

and could be mapped and weighed

Back up through the results

back up through results

higher up in the results

back up through the results

Higher up in the results

high in the content architecture

high up in the results

high up in the architecture

high up in the content architecture

blue and sun again a second, then night

your bid to the next highest ranked network

I had nightmares though

In my sight 

I love my daughter still

I cannot clear it also through divestiture

though not many freeze up

though not many face up

though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through investiture

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

though as for conversing

Though in not many acts

Though in not many acts up in the sky

though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts

Though it is not many simple acts

Though it is not a simple act

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Can I clear it through emphatic seizure

though it is not a simple act

You can clear it also through static seizure

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure

You can clear it also through static siezure

You can hear it also through static leisure

You can clear it also through static leisure

The sun high enough to enter directly 

I get through there

in pursuit of the sight

I get from here through there

I get here through there

in traversing get through there

get from here through there

I tell you the weight of my purchases

They can be weighed

I tell you the weight of my purposes

weight of my purposes

Is the weight of my purchases

Is the weight of my click or zipcode

Though we are waiting for her

I thought

dawn already formerly nights 

The sun high enough to enter directly

though we are still breaking in

I though

though we are breaking in the space that it had

Though we are breaking 

Though we are breaking

drawn formerly rights ending themselves

last night

with the latency last night

with a latency last night

Though we are waiting 

with dawn already formerly nights 

converting sight

own stays brought loyal

own that stays brought loyal

that stays brought loyal

my sight hosting

about the sight hosting trusting

by the sight of the hosting answered about

stopped light with validated fields

after though there’s no memory

though we are waiting for her

with my daughter

my daughter will learn 

bought in the sounded privacy

bought in the surrounded privacy 

converting sight into a purchase

My daughter with her way

Though we can’t help waiting

Though we can’t help waiting for her

My daughter helps too

My daughter turns it off too

battery dawn nights 

nights

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

battery dawn nights

I answered what I thought

dawn formerly rights ended themselves

where rights ended themselves

where lights blended themselves

stopped light with validated faces

my daughter’s squirrel and chickadee joined me

battery dawn nights ending themselves

I answered what I thought about

dawn formerly rights lended themselves

dawn formerly nights lended themselves

dawn formerly rights blended themselves

drawn formerly rights blended themselves

dawn formerly nights ended themselves

drawn formerly rights

drawn formerly rights ended themselves

That are my right to say

the right of my elections

I stay the right of my elections

to the right of a surcharge

I stay the right of my possessions 

The right of incurred elections

The right of interned elections

To the right of determined elections

To the right of interned possessions

To the right of deterred elections

To the right of interned elections

to the right of possessions

to return what I bought

the right of possessions

to the right marking

the right of surcharge

as the right of a surcharge

the right of a surcharge

The weight kept moaned impression

in my freight kept owned impression

home stays brought loyal

own stays bought loyal

bought stays own loyal

at home brought into private

brought messageable into privacy

brought into private messageably

brought into privacy

The sun high enough to strike directly
