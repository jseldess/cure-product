['is', 'one']


But that is beside the point
I have entered my phone

Falling from this distance
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

What is an impure product
Before anyone buys up the opening

Of course there is a direction
Before anyone walks across the opening

The sun isn’t up 
Actually one day there is direction

The edge is put in place
Did he carry one virtue to excess

The sun isn’t up
If he had not carried one virtue

You can hear it also through your leisure
not one virtue to excess

attesting this is a chance
if he had not carried one virtue 

nor work in this way daily
nor envy honest work

Visible or
Having transitioned from leisure to work

Then the sun isn’t up
reflexing indented in my phone

I resume attributable visions
As a clone, illegally conceived

here is the site of the battle of maldon
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

missing words
nor envy honestly

This is your voice 
We got paid one way by a voice

This is your chance
A way formerly like this one

they should rise up
from no one point

myself moved literally as it is
that agreed one of rest

decisioned to learn 
decisioned to learn back

if there is anything 
– The Rolling Stones

I had me a vision
in need one in that best own

speech that is of by prospects
decisioned by the prospect

phase decisioned by the prospect
phase decisioned

I ask say in that phase decisioned
Formerly a way like this one

formerly a way like this one
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

The other end of transactions like this
Like this one other end of transactions

To the other end of means like this one
Like this one the other end of means

like this one
I end up Bach forty-one seconds in

that is by possessed
need one in best own

phase decision for learning
I had entered my phone

and persisting and replicating
shone from the housing

in memory persisting elsewhere
shone formerly along time

decisions that can be attributable
that agreed to one the people

phase decision step in
traffick is there nonetheless

revisions that can be attributable
