['ll', 'ould']


The dogs and lillies
You should ask who I am

between bills and stuffed animals
over the long line I would honor

I am told by no ventillation
I would like your zip code

I’ll get there eventually
While I should be sleeping

Then fall then summer
While I should be sleeping 

Even before the skills aquired
Looking back while I should be sleeping

the dogs and lillies
and could be mapped and weighed

When they really take hold of my finger
Would I love the same stuff

falling off the encoded end
but would I love her the same

I take it out in the snow fall
What would I feel without that goal

I love my daughter still
But would I love her the same

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I even know what I would find

will not be the same
until I could not tire 

I can hear them between bills and stuff
until I could not tire

So I constellate the time family country
until I could not be tired

under pillowing a cloud
I could in effect credit

that will spur me on
I could consume the dream

Articles all around us
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

I tell you my purposes
One was up where it should be down

I tell you the weight of my purposes
Not even a [blank] would elect to be

As a clone, illegally conceived
and we could inhabit the room easy

We had inhabited actually
And we could inhabit the room easy

in the form filled offered in trust
all parties would be held

and literally moved
people would be helped

though we are still breaking in
The constituents would be helped

all parties would be helped
where I send and relive would be held

All parties would be held for my own purchases
All parties would be held

and literally unproved
they should rise up

to take the call
would only willingly break

would only speak willingly
would speak willingly 

would speak willingly only
would only willingly speak

without really branding 
and could be inflected with reasons

my daughter will learn
