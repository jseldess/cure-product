The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

too sunny to eat ice cream
So I went back to sleep
attempted anachronism

Looking back while I should be sleeping
Then I cannot see face value
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

emerging this year from too much standing water
to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water
I was enjoined to act again myself

Booked with a meeting
After having been contented
Then the sun isn’t available

learned without too much difficulty to code
after having been contented
blue and sun again a second, then night

upsent in the afternoon
then I cannot see face value
I am bid to act again

in the simple act of opening a book
I need an explicit statement
talking into pheasants bending themselves

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
You need history
without ensuing damage

I shivered looking up
I see you knitting uproars with a bow
I let it remind me again

and we could inhabit the room easy
between that day
