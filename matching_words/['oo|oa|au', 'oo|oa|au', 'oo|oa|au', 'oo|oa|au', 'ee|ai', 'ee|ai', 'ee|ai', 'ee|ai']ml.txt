The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
because it was really dark
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
too sunny to eat ice cream
So I went back to sleep
Then I cannot see face value
such as I see
such as I can see

In the light of retroactive conversations
In the light of retroactive
before we can have a retroactive
Though there are quarters goals
does not feel an exception
drifting does not feel an exception
and can’t presume to need
Then I can’t presume to need others

and without quartely goals
There are quarterly goals
Looking back while I should be sleeping
emerging this year from too much standing water
to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water
to see the patterns on the birds
to see the sunrise
I was enjoined to act again myself

Booked with a meeting
before morning goals
learned without too much difficulty to code
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
I see only the back of falling values
blue and sun again a second, then night
I see only the back
I see the back of the planning process

an upsent afternoon
upsent in the afternoon
in front of the set afternoon
not goals
I see only the back of my habits
I see the back of falling values
I can see only the back of falling values
I can see only values falling back

Not goals or tactics
Running above broadway
I love my daughter still
What would I feel without that goal
What would I feel without a goal
I can hear it between bills and stuff
may not be ingrained
may not be engrained

hauling off the end of the world
in the simple act of opening a book
over the roof of the buildings across the alley
So I look up and don’t walk any
You need history
like flattening sleep 
like sleep
which is like sleep

I shivered looking up
I see you knitting uproars with a bow
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
we had to say goodbye
Having been purchased out of you
Sweets and coffee and juice
Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Sweets and coffee

We had to say goodbye there
And we had to say goodbye to her there
and we could inhabit the room easy

and to which I’ve agreed
Though we are waiting for her
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

The floor slanted in places
by the side of the road
Where in me did I loose
with my daughter
Having seen more than 
speech my possession of my children
that agreed one of rest
in need one in that best own

my daughter will learn 
My daughter with her way
Selma knows too 
Selma helps too
Though we can’t help waiting
Though we can’t help waiting for her
But my not feeling the memory inside
By my feeling the memory inside

my daughter’s squirrel and chickadee joined me
reflexing indented in my moan
state kept moaned impression
My state kept loaned impression
speech that is of by prospects
that agreed home
between bills and stuffed animals
that agreed to one the people

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
in school and can see offering
