['ot', 'me', 'no', 'ld']


into rotating directionless 
into the minority proportion of time
Then I cannot see face value
off the edge of the world

not calling or echoing for once
Then fall then summer from my face
and not falling at all
about my children’s consumption

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
When I want something
on a snow day with my children
Before anyone has walked across the field

if not directly on my skin
only fragments of time with my children
Daniel Tiger on a snow day
especially in a child

They’re just not mine
wrestling me to stay still
Though how can you know without direction
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

does not feel an exception
Then fall then summer
drifting does not feel an exception
To my children Walt Whitman

But not to impart cynicism
What does it mean to drift
the drifting is not something special
I am told ventillation

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
So I constellate the time family country
Which can be pronounced to the world
The world 

not one virtue to excess
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
for not voting for him
I would like your zip code

But not to me directly
I spend time online learning to code
in a continuous vertiginous dream
and could be mapped and weighed

not back in the results
In a continuous theme
there was no promotion
shielding from the bandwidth

I’ll pull myself another personality type
on the time line I was on
by no ventillation my purpose
I am told by no ventillation

So that I notice I am the only one
Strategy comes before morning
out in the snow
off the end of the world

I am full of potential
with full potential to movement
I take it out in the snow fall
What would I feel without that goal

promoting from home to a new job
I had me a vision
there was no walking along
hauling off the end of the world

may not be ingrained
I resume unassimilable visions
may not be engrained
falling off the end of the world

black spots on a white surface
will not be the same
will no be ingrainded 
until I could not tire 

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
What was the last time
though not many facts up in the sky
until I could not tire

until I could not be tired
I need an explicit statement
The sun high enough to enter directly 
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

it was not just a defeat
advancing the time
until I could not be hired
I could in effect credit

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I came after my past
I used my technology
designed to hold up my underwear

all the spots
or in some imaginary elsewhere
that nothing had gravity
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

so that nothing had gravity
My means without gravity
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
here is the site of the battle of maldon

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
or alter of course the time anyway
The sun high enough to enter directly
people would be helped

not speaking
A way formerly like this one
But my not feeling the memory aside
all parties would be held

But my not feeling the memory inside
dawn formerly
not needing to wait
would only willingly break

for not paying redundant
for not paying sound overwhelmed
ground for not paying
my possession of my children

I presume to others
Where in me did I host
and it’s not literal
stopped light with validated fields

not literally moved about
washed by my memory
after though there’s no memory
speech my possession of my children

to the other end
Formerly a way like this one
It’s not marshal exactly
and could be inflected with reasons

which is not necessarily possible
So I presume the offers already
for a while not to listen
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

I assume possession to others
I presume to others 
in that I cannot remember
