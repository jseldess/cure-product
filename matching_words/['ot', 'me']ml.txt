['ot', 'me']


into rotating directionless 
into the minority proportion of time

Then I cannot see face value
Then I constellate my time family country

not calling or echoing for once
Then fall then summer from my face

and not falling at all
Then fall then summer

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
When I want something

if not directly on my skin
only fragments of time with my children

They’re just not mine
wrestling me to stay still

into rotating and directionless space
Which is a measure to never live out

others desires
Then I can’t presume to need others

If I let myself see others desires
where I sleep at times

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
at any time it can drift again

But not to impart cynicism
What does it mean to drift

the drifting is not something special
over the long time up in the sky

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
That’s where I sleep at times

I’ll pull myself another personality type
So I constellate the time family country

If he had not carried one virtue
I constellate the time

not one virtue to excess
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

for not voting for him
when we had jobs that was to churn some bread

if he had not carried one virtue 
 and time in the train

But not to me directly
I spend time online learning to code

not back in the results
In a continuous theme

there was no promotion
On the timeline I was on

So that I notice I am the only one
Strategy comes before morning

I just got a letter
I had me a vision

I am full of potential
with full potential to movement

full of potential
since you can imagine movement

that potential is there for you
Would I love the same stuff

white spots on a black surface
but would I love her the same

promoting from home to a new job
promoting from home

may not be ingrained
I resume unassimilable visions

black spots on a white surface
will not be the same

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
If I take a different measure

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
What was the last time

not many face up
explicit statements

though not many facts up in the sky
If I take some different measure

until I could not tire 
I resume indelible tracks

I cannot clear it also through investiture
wrapped in static implicit statements

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I resume attributable visions

until I could not tire
The long time I had a vision

until I could not be tired
I need an explicit statement

it was not just a defeat
advancing the time

until I could not be hired
without the long time I was accounting

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I came after my past

all the spots
or in some imaginary elsewhere

that nothing had gravity
My means without gravity

so that nothing had gravity
without consumer damage

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
or alter of course the time anyway

and other types of tracking technology
and elsewhere my memory of you

But my not feeling the memory aside
and elsewhere my memory 

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
washed my memory

not speaking
A way formerly like this one

But my not feeling the memory inside
dawn formerly

not needing to wait
firing and connecting somewhere

for not paying redundant
for not paying sound overwhelmed

ground for not paying
latency which doesn’t mean anything

useless for not having paid
Where in me did I host

and it’s not literal
already formerly a long time

I presume to others
Elsewhere by my memory

not literally moved about
washed by my memory

to the other end
Formerly a way like this one

It’s not marshal exactly
formerly a way

to the other end of actions
formerly a way like this one

The other end of means
Formerly away there are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
By my feeling the memory inside

the other end of actions
To the other end of means like this one

Like this one the other end of means
formerly away

with constant ways to the other end
formerly my way 

But my not 
joined me in wasting my vision

Aligned or not with my interests
which I feel formerly about for

I turn not sad exactly
By my memory elsewhere

Cereal and others’ health
I have them trust in me

in that I cannot remember 
I assume the offers revisitable

which is not necessarily possible
So I presume the offers already

for a while not to listen
presume the offers at 

I assume possession to others
I presume to others 

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
I assume the offers reliable
