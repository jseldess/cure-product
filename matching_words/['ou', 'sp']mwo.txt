Arrayed out in such a nested way
I suspend live connections to you
I upend my connections to you
I upend live connections to you
I intend my connections to you
You should ask who I am
I suspend my connections to you
I intend my live connections to you
My live connections to you
Suspended live in connections to you
at home brought into privacy
already brought into privacy
brought messageable to you
Then I constellate my time family country
reasons resources
asynchronous 
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
about my children’s consumption
conversations with our purchase
conversations with our reactions
conversations with our feelings
Of course there is a direction
conversation with our feelings
Though there are quarters goals
Though there are quarters goals 
how can I know without direction
for how can I know without direction
As though stationary and a destination
And put in place as though stationary
I can’t fix them without direction
Though how can you know without direction
though there are quarters with goals
for how can you know without direction
slow asynchronous
You can hear it also through your leisure
Which is a measure to never live out
Without a proposed budget
Without a head
and without quartely goals
and without a proposed budget
Without imparting cynicism 
bring your child along
without imparting the cynicism
The South Carolina primary 
So I constellate the time family country
over the long line I would honor
out in the snow
Which can be pronounced to the world
Which is a pleasure to never live out
if you have providence to excess
which can be pronounced 
though it was most emphatically that
If you have confidence regardless all else
Two hours and
May I have your zip code
I would like your zip code
While I should be sleeping
In a vertiginous dream
I brought my head down
I brought my qualities down
A turtle fished out of the lake
The leaves curdled on the tree out front
Some disease effecting the tree out front
fish pulled out of the lake
in a continuous vertiginous dream
out of remnant pages
Spinning around the heart
While I should be sleeping 
You use the most essential parts
Looking back while I should be sleeping
which I brought down with qualities
In a continuous theme
I brought my count down
and could be mapped and weighed
could map to the dimnsions of a graph
While I should sleep not back in the results
Remnant continuous pages
Back up through the results
remnant continuous pages
out of remnant ages
back up through results
back up through the results
out of later results
out of the remnant ruins
out of the back page ruins
out from below the fold
out of the fifth page ruins
or an available resource
barely outlines
learned without too much difficulty to code
out in the snow 
out in the snow fall
out in the snow falling face value
That you can see only the back of
with four key value pairs
your bid to the next highest ranked network
the next network in your ranking
since you can imagine movement
I had nightmares though
that potential is there for you
Would I love the same stuff
but would I love her the same
without the long time I was accounting
I take it out in the snow fall
What would I feel without that goal
What would I feel without a goal
Would I love the same
Undoubtedly 
But would I love her the same
no solid ground to continue along
where you can earn more 
than solid ground
because there was no solid ground to continue along
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I even know what I would find
that I hear without trying
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I cannot clear it also through divestiture
though not many freeze up
though not many face up
though not many facts up in the sky
until I could not tire 
I cannot clear it also through investiture
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
though as for conversing
Though in not many acts
Though in not many acts up in the sky
though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts
Though it is not many simple acts
Though it is not a simple act
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Can I clear it through emphatic seizure
though it is not a simple act
You can clear it also through static seizure
The simple act opening surmounted
The simple act of opening surmounted
the simple act of honoring an accountant
of honoring surmounted
the simple act of opening surmounted
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
in the simple act of opening an accountant
You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
You can clear it also through static siezure
You can hear it also through static leisure
You can clear it also through static leisure
until I could not tire
until I could not be tired
The sun high enough to enter directly 
around my country 
Then I saw into you
You need history
you need history
until I could not be hired
the clouds hinged the horizon
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
under pillowing a cloud
under pillowing a loud 
the cloud
billowing in the cloud
without the long time I was on accounting
without accounting the long time I was on
without accounting for credit
I get through there
I could in effect credit
I could effect credit
I get from here through there
I get here through there
without ensuing damage
in traversing get through there

a futile joyous white sun
I see you knitting uproars with a bow
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I could consume the dream
purchased out
having been purchased out
having been purchased out 
having been purchased out of you
Articles all around us
Having been purchased out of you
articles all around us
articles all around storming around
Articles all around stores in surfeit
Articles all around storming around
And need out in front purchase
And read out in front
I tell you my purposes
I tell you the weight of my purchases
around the dogs and lillies
I spin around
around 
I spin around 
I spun around trying to touch the spots
I click my zipcode up where it should be down
One was up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity
without consumer damage
My means without gravity
without longer damage
without any further damage
without any longer damage
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
some sort of a futile joyous white sun
Not even a [blank] would elect to be
and we could inhabit the room easy
or alter of course the time anyway
Though we are waiting for her
I thought
And we could inhabit the room easy
Or alter of course the time anyway
all parties would be held
without really agreeing
The South Carolina primary
The sun high enough to enter directly
This is your voice 
This is your choice 
More reasons around my country 
and elsewhere my memory of you
This is your chance

people would be helped
people would prevent
though we are still breaking in
I though
The constituents would be helped
all parties would be helped
without really speaking
though we are breaking in the space that it had
where I send and relive would be held
found dated for my own purchases
sound inundated for my own purchases
All parties would be held for my own purchases
and found inundated
and sound redundant
Though we are breaking 
Though we are breaking
All parties would be held
without really breaking

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
burrowed about from repeated travels
answered about

and around redundant
and latency found
for not paying sound overwhelmed
ground for not paying
until a happier time found
without really branding 
without really binding myself
and literally moved about
Though we are waiting 
without really binding
without their agreement
without really needing

own that stays brought loyal

Though we can’t help waiting
Though we can’t help waiting for her

Who throws contours away

The contours exchange with you

I answered what I thought
radiating from housing
shone from the housing
I answered what I thought about
about

the young ripples inaudibly
buy in the sound privacy
phrase them of our possessions
and could be inflected with reasons

home stays brought loyal

more to ourselves insure
form to more ourselves
home rest form to ourselves 
own stays bought loyal
bought stays own loyal
So I found myself at home
at home brought into private
I offer to you
brought messageable into privacy
brought into private messageably
brought into privacy
The sun high enough to strike directly
You can have seen offering
