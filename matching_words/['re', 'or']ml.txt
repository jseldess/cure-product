['re', 'or']


Where I sleep at times
into the minority proportion of time

Whereas direction is beside the point
off the edge of the world

On a snow day with my children
Before we walk across the wide field

variegated reflected light
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

as pure as my children
I told her a story, she drew waves.

because it was really dark
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Between the face of pure joy and an interface.
When I woke up in the morning

it was really sunny
not calling or echoing for once

I have entered my phone
Before we walk across the wide opening

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

In the light of retroactive
before we can have a retroactive

What is an impure product
Before anyone buys up the opening

I reach repeated expressions first
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

if not directly on my skin
Before anyone walks across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the opening
before anyone has walked across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the field
or the incoming stream

love of breadth
for how can I know without direction

The edge isn’t even there
or not even rotating

for how can you know without direction
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

reasons resources
For whom drifting is not an exception

To my children
For whom 

bearing children along
or currents of air

I’ll get there eventually
There are performance reviews

I let myself treat
But in more 

here described
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

as a pure product
to be before the sun

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
Which can be pronounced to the world

You can hear it also through your leisure
for not voting for him

when we had jobs that was to churn some bread
The world 

into a brigand and a murderer
in short

Credit or
Blue sky or

Regrettable or
Reliable or

In a vertiginous dream
Even before the lesson starts

Even before the skills aquired
hold at intervals riding forward

in a continuous vertiginous dream
at intervals while riding forward

I put my bread down
rewind before the sun

So I was advised to rewind
Back up before the sun

back up the results
back up before the results

higher up in the results
before the sun’s deflections

Higher up in the results
tomorrow

Forecasting the story before dawn
or an available resource

executive breath
over the long line I would honor

before morning goals
Tomorrow

barely outlines
Having transitioned from leisure to work

Strategy comes before morning
Before morning goals

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

Its strategy comes before morning goals
Strategy comes before goals

is pressing
The planning process for visions

of the habits I create
The planning process is for visionaries only

of the habits they create
oddly grown over with historic bark

They are called aspirational
your bid to the next highest ranked network

there was no promotion
off the end of the world

with implicit regulations
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
or argued for them at least

The days are long
The days aligned for company

with little reasons to aspiration
that potential is there for you

with little reason to move
where you can earn more 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
hauling off the end of the world

but they are black spots
as far back as my history heard

I reuse indelible tracks
Tomorrow 

Where I take my liesure
falling off the end of the world

I reuse indelible tracks 
tomorrow 

I believe I can prepare for it
falling off the end of the word

I resume unassimilable visions
I need the work

though not many freeze up
though as for conversing

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
which I needed for an explicit state

Which is a pleasure to never live out
I walk up and don’t work anymore

Toward the start informally given my reasons
So I work and don’t look any

More reasons 
You need history

for to tire as far back as my history
you need history

flattening my reception
for as far back as my history

until I could not be hired
until I purpose the horizon

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
like state mirror

I resume attributable visions
I enter the flattening mirror

without accounting for credit
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses

here is the site of the battle of maldon
missing words

I captured an afterimage
With a fervor 

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
storing in surfeit

And we had to say goodbye to her there
for an ungraspable purchase

We had to say goodbye there
If articles can storm in excess

Articles all around stores in surfeit
Articles all around storming around

We had to buy there
For an ungraspable time

And read out in front
For an ungraspable purchase

 of those gathered
And for an ungraspable time

While they’re up in the sky
I have supporters

where I need gravity
having supporters 

And from that great distance
or in some imaginary elsewhere

While we’re up in the sky
I click or my zipcode

One was up where it should be down
Is the weight of my click or zipcode

Where I need gravity
missing words 

Then I continue to dream then
full of the missing words

I shivered looking up
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

Though we are waiting for her
already formerly a long time

Where in me did I host
in the form filled offered in trust

Elsewhere by my memory
washed by my memory

and to which I’ve agreed

formerly a long time they were on

without really agreeing
I have a memory between the day

The sun high enough to enter directly
and elsewhere my memory

If you have confidence regardless all else
nor work in this way daily

More reasons around my country 
and elsewhere my memory of you

I have entered my purchases
But my not feeling the memory aside

I stand and retrieve the impulse
the impulse for my own prospects

where I end
the impulse for my own purposes

where I stand aside
and elsewhere my memory 

I have entered my purposes
Elsewhere my memory

entered into my purposes
washed my memory

A way formerly like this one

without really speaking
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

where I send and relive would be held

For my own purchases

where I send and retrieve aside
But my not feeling the memory inside

Though we are waiting 
it can be uncomfortable 

without their agreement

The floor slanted in places

with dawn already formerly nights 
Having seen more than 

my possession of my children
forgetting decisions 

I presume to others
worn as it was designed

pre-worn in me

Where in me did I lose

Formerly a way like this one

Though we can’t help waiting for her

There are constant ways
Formerly away there are constant ways

I answered what I thought
shone formerly a long time

where rights ended themselves
drawn formerly a long time

tracked between buffered and sizes

I am requesting my point
But my feeling the memory aside

at least for the duration of the answer

recalling aside
Aligned or not with my interests

I had entered my phone
by my memory elsewhere

in memory elsewhere
but for memory elsewhere

in memory persisting elsewhere

I answered what I thought about
but standing in memory

where lights blended themselves

formerly along the time they were on
for my own purposes

I return not sad exactly

abjure them with determining 
behind or out front or up above

I returned not sad exactly

reflexing indented in my phone

I can’t remember them

So I presume the offers already

more to ourselves insure

inure tranquility

that agreed home to people

The prospects there already
for a while to listen already

So I presume the offers at home already
for a while to listen 

I resume the offers at home
for a while not to listen

presume the offers at 
For a while I think I don’t listen

traffick is there nonetheless
The prospect for careening attached

between the preambles
The prospect for careening healthily

between the preamble
The prospect for veering healthily

between the preambles 
forgettable

I assume the offers revisitable
Having seen more than I can remember 

I have seen more than I can remember
seen having or offering possession

I presume to others 
and maybe forgettable

revisital
