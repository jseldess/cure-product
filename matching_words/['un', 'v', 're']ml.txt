The sun isn’t up 
I upend live connections to you
Where I sleep at times

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
variegated reflected light
I’ll get there eventually

Then I constellate my time family country
I assumed it was visible
into rotating directionless 

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

it was really sunny
I have entered my phone
Before we walk across the wide opening

The sun isn’t up
Which is a measure to never live out
as a pure product

So I constellate the time family country
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
executive breath

to be before the sun
I am told by no ventillation
reasons resources

Which can be pronounced to the world
Then I cannot see face value
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

which can be pronounced 
Which is a pleasure to never live out
But in more 

Then the sun isn’t up
not one virtue to excess
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

Then the sun isn’t available
In a vertiginous dream
Where official policy is to catch and release

Spinning around the heart
Even before the lesson starts
Even before the skills aquired

I brought my count down
hold at intervals riding forward
in a continuous vertiginous dream

an unassimilable desire against me
at intervals while riding forward
I put my bread down

rewind before the sun
So I was advised to rewind
Back up before the sun

before the sun’s deflections
So I was advised to back up
Higher up in the results

Then the sun isn’t up 
Eventually
Out of remnant pages 

to see the sunrise
I had me a vision
there was no promotion

The sun shielding 
eventually
or an available resource

sun
I am told ventillation
execute breath

until my purpose up in the sky
over the time line I was on
before morning goals

but the sun isn’t up
I see only the back of falling values
is pressing

blue and sun again a second, then night
I see the back of falling values
of the habits I create

is a function of the strength
their economic value
with implicit regulations

is a function of the strength 
oddly grown over with historic bark
They are called aspirational

Running above broadway
Would I love the same stuff
If I take a different measure

I reuse unassimilable visions
talking into pheasants bending themselves
Where I take my liesure

no solid ground to continue along
and continue along having 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

I resume unassimilable visions
The long time I had a vision
I reuse indelible tracks 

without the long time I was accounting
in traversing my purchase
If I take some different measure

until I could not tire 
I cannot clear it also through divestiture
up in the television pleasure

The simple act opening surmounted
I resume attributable visions
What I do in my liesure

until I could not tire
over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I walk up and don’t work anymore

around my country 
Then I saw them interview
If you have confidence regardless all else

until I could not be tired
The long time I was a vision
flattening my reception

until I could not be hired
I had a vision
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

like un
talking into percents bending themselves
I get through there

under the last seen principle
in traversing get through there
get from here through there

a futile joyous white sun
I shivered looking up
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
having been an ungraspable time
I captured an afterimage

Articles all around us
Having been purchased out of you
And we had to say goodbye to her there

she lay under the grass
even my child
We had to say goodbye there

articles all around storming around
Even the children
 of those gathered

She lay under the grass
where I need gravity
While they’re up in the sky

until I purpose up in the sky
there wasn’t any television 
And reached up the screen

around the dogs and lillies
I watch a movie
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

unnerving my wing
Where I lead gravity
I continued to dream then

And for an ungraspable time
they can be waived
And from that great distance

I spin around
I have supporters
And from a great distance

until I purchase the sky
They can be waived
One was up where it should be down

until the bill came
My means without gravity
That I captured an afterimage

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
Though we are waiting for her

The sun high enough to enter directly
nor envy honest work
More reasons around my country 

which we can pronounce
I send and retrieve the impulse
I stand and retrieve the impulse

I send and retrieve aside the impulse

Is there a baby and a bear

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
with no constant waves
There are no constant waves

stopped light with validated fields
By my memory elsewhere

iced coffee and sun position
not literally moved
Aligned or not with my interests

the bill my detuning 
behind or out front or up above
I returned not sad exactly

sung reflexing
and advantaged irretrievably
I returned to location

lung reflexing
devoid kept moaned reflexing
into liminal reflexing

the young ripples inaudibly
the void kept owned impression
in my freight kept owned impression

buy in the sound privacy
I assume the offers revisitable
revisable

sizes asking for tracking sound
visions that can be attainable
advised to be retainable

So I found myself at home
already brought into privacy
the prospects there already

The sun high enough to strike directly
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
I assumed that they were divisible
