into the stream of pictures
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
slow
The dogs and lillies

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
So I went back to sleep
Because it was really dark
battery dawn nights blending themselves

In a sharp downard turn
I want to find a way to block it incoming
I want to find a way to block it
I reach repeated expressions first

Of course there is a direction
I can find a way to block it incoming
Before anyone has walked across the opening
as long as I have access to the code

interjecting into the stream of pictures
I keep turning back again myself
I brought my head down
I brought my qualities down

A turtle fished out of the lake
Out of the back page ruins
low in the content architecture
my desires were open

Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
Looking back while I should be sleeping
at intervals while riding forward
which I brought down with qualities

I keep turning back
not back in the results
with my head
the dogs and lillies

high in the content architecture
I see only the back of falling values
out in the snow
I see the back of the planning process

with four key value pairs
white spots on a black surface
black spots on a white surface
What I do in my liesure

Where I take my liesure
I reuse indelible tracks 
without the long time I was accounting
I resume unassimilable visions

If I take a different measure
The first track
hauling off the end of the world
talking into pheasants bending themselves

White spots on a black surface
The first track 
falling off the end of the word
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

up in the television pleasure
as far back as my history heard
What was the last time
I resume indelible tracks

I cannot clear it also through investiture
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
I can hear them between bills and stuff
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
for to tire as far back as my history
while wrapped in explicit static
I resume attributable visions

in traversing my purchase
I came back to me
I watch a movie
I continue to presume

in traversing my purpose
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
Articles all around us

Having been purchased out of you
I click my zipcode up where it should be down
They can be waived
I tell you the weight of my purposes

weight of my purposes
Is the weight of my click or zipcode
They can be weighed
I tell you the weight of my purchases

Is the weight of my purchases
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
full of the missing words
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

or alter of course the time anyway
and other types of tracking technology
was not just a defeat
nor envy honest work

This is your voice 
trackers collecting data on users
washed my memory
They have very many choices

elsewhere my purposes
decisioned to learn back
which as tracked befitted 
I designated 

buy in the surrounded privacy
sizes track for asking sound
between tracked and buffered
tracked between buffered and sizes

bought in the surrounded privacy 
which as tracked befitted  
we ask say in that case
I speak them of my possessions

converting sight into a purchase
Selma’s squirrel and chickadee
joined me in wasting my vision
Aligned or not with my interests

I turn not sad exactly
which as tracked befitted
which as tracked befitted phased
sizes asking for tracking sound
