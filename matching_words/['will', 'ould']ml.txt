['will', 'ould']


interjecting on a day there will be ambition
over the long line I would honor

will not be the same
until I could not tire 

that will spur me on
I could consume the dream

would only willingly break
would only speak willingly

would speak willingly 
all parties would be held

would speak willingly only
would only willingly speak

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
and could be inflected with reasons

my daughter will learn
