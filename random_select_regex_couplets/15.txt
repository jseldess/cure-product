('A', 'so')

Arrayed
I’ll pull myself another personality type

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
When I want something

All of the time
You can hear it also through your leisure

And as an extension of the values
soft paper

And make myself a visible
reasons resources

BREAK
I want to cite a poem so usual

ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’
solvents

Attributable or
A person from a distance

After having been contented
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

As an extension of the values
embodied with little reason

All that I can think I want
If I take some different measure

A defeated
Toward the start informally given my reasons

COPY DREAM 
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

And reached up the screen
so that nothing had gravity

As a clone, illegally conceived
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

And we could inhabit the room easy
More reasons around my country

('are', 'side')

Though there are quarters goals
aside from the retinas

I had nightmares though
actually considering the end

There are spots waiting
But my not feeling the memory aside

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

Though we are breaking 
where I send and relive aside

Though we are waiting 
by the side of the hosting service

still carefully
But my not feeling the memory inside

Though we are waiting for her
By my feeling the memory inside

There are constant ways
44 seconds inside

That are my right to say

('at', 'literally')

But that is beside the point
and literally moved

if that has anything
as it was designed literally

found dated for my own purchases
and literally unproved

and found inundated
literally unproved 

and drowned inundated
myself moved literally as it is

I designated 
I literally moved

and move them literally with me

latency which doesn’t mean anything
and literally moved about

that is by possessed
literally moved

what literally moved
not literally moved about

so still watch them
not literally moved

to return what I bought

('day', 'There')

On a snow day with my children
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

One day there is direction
There are quarterly goals

I argued the days felt longer
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

The day
There are constant ways

at least most days

('feel', 'sight')

conversations with our feelings
In my sight 

What would I feel without that goal
in pursuit of the sight

But my not feeling the memory aside
converting sight

which feels most comfortable
my sight hosting

which is what feels most comfortable
about the sight hosting trusting

which I feel formerly about for
converting sight into a purchase

But my not feeling the memory inside

('For', 'call')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
though it was most emphatically that

Forecasting the story before dawn
They are called aspirational

For an ungraspable time
Which can be called confidence

For my own purchases
to take the call

Formerly a way like this one
The many transparent pixel calls

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
recalling aside

For a while I think I don’t listen

('formerly', 'elections')

already formerly a long time
on my way to elections

dawn already formerly nights 
formerly my way to the elections

shone formerly a long time
on a way to the elections

formerly along time they were on
formerly along my say to the elections

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
formally a way to the elections

which I feel formerly about for
My say to the elections


('from', 'inter')

Then fall then summer from my face
interjecting on a day ambition

from the incoming stream
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

Falling from this distance
way high up in the inter

Falling from my face
way high up in the internet

A person from a distance
hold at intervals riding forward

out from below the fold
high up in the internet

emerging this year from standing water
higher up in the internet

Having transitioned from leisure to work
with internally regulated climate

aside from the retinas
Then I saw them interview

I get from here through there
my interfaced stand data

radiating from housing
I interfaced


('he', 'mine')

But that is beside the point
They’re just not mine

Actually one day there is direction
The third letter from the end is mine

It’s the third letter from the end
The ads in mine

off the end of the world
To the right of determined elections

To the right of interned possessions
determined by elections

To the right of deterred elections

('her', 'time.')

Where I sleep at times
Then I constellate my time family country

I told her a story, she drew waves.
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

Of course there is a direction
only fragments of time with my children

on a day there will be direction
at any time it can drift again

others desires
over the long time up in the sky

I’ll get there eventually
That’s where I sleep at times

Others desires as legitimate
So I constellate the time family country

I’ll pull myself another personality type
on the time line I was on

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
 and time in the train

Where official policy is to catch and release
I spend time online learning to code

Where I put it beating
On the timeline I was on

I’ll pull myself higher up
over the time line I was on

there was no promotion
The long time I had a vision

Where I take my liesure
without the long time I was accounting

On the other hand
The long time I was a vision

I get through there
the long time I was on

I get from here through there
or alter of course the time anyway

Though we are waiting for her

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
only fragments of time with my children

It has been since
where I sleep at times

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

It’s the third letter from the end
The long time I had a vision

It’s not marshal exactly
formerly along time they were on


('line', 'eat')

on the time line I was on
executive breath

over the time line I was on
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I spend time online learning to code
Where I put it beating

On the timeline I was on
execute breath

over the long line up in the sky

The days lined along company
That company creates a life

('me', 'damage')

Where I sleep at times
without ensuing damage

I came after my past
while consuming damage

And for an ungraspable time
without consumer damage

My means without gravity
without longer damage

to any consumer damage
without any longer damage

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

('off', 'And')

I step off the edge
And put in place as though stationary

off the edge of the world
And as an extension of the values

I am first in the office 
And make myself a visible

Falling off the edge of the face
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Sweets and coffee and juice
And need out in front purchase

in the form filled offered in trust
And we could inhabit the room easy

in the form filled offered trust

('one', 'purchase')

I have entered my phone
conversations with our purchase

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
in traversing my purchase

reflexing indented in my phone
purchased out

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
having been purchased out

As a clone, illegally conceived
I have entered my purchases

A way formerly like this one

converting sight into a purchase

Formerly a way like this one

I had entered my phone
at the site of a purchase

that agreed to one the people

into the minority proportion of time
in a sharp downward turn 

Before we walk across the wide field
In a sharp downard turn

Before we walk across the wide opening
It keeps coming down thankfully

Before anyone walks across the wide opening

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I brought my head down

off the edge of the world
I brought my qualities down

to be before the sun
which I brought down with qualities

hold at intervals riding forward
I put my bread down

at intervals while riding forward
I brought my count down

rewind before the sun
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

I click or my zipcode
One was up where it should be down

And for an ungraspable time

('out', 'There')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

how can I know without direction
There are quarterly goals

The South Carolina primary 
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Which is a pleasure to never live out
There was very little physical activity

There are spots waiting

without ensuing damage
There are constant ways

All that I own messageable

('retroactive', 'he')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
Then fall then summer from my face

In the retroactive light
Face falling off the edge of the face

Then fall then summer

In the light of retroactive conversations
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

In the light of retroactive
Of course there is a direction

before we can have a retroactive
Before anyone buys up the opening


('see', 'child')

Then I cannot see face value
On a snow day with my children

such as I see
especially in a child

If I let myself see others desires
To my children Walt Whitman

where I can claim to see the ruins
even my child

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
my possession of my children

Having seen more than 
speech my possession of my children

('stand', 'turn')

hovering above standing water
who knows how to turn it off

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
Bach helps turn it off

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
My daughter turns it off too

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
I turn not sad exactly

my standing in data
I return not sad exactly

I learned the point of standing
I returned


('static', 'up?')

wrapped in static and explicit statements
I cannot clear it also through investiture

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I resume indelible tracks

wrapped in static implicit statements
though as for conversing

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
black spots on a white surface

You can clear it also through static seizure
The simple act opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
You can clear it also through static siezure

You can hear it also through static leisure
You can clear it also through static leisure

wrapped in static
I resume attributable visions

while wrapped in static
You can hear it also through your leisure

while wrapped in explicit static
until I could not be tired

while we’re wrapped in static
until I could not be hired


('time.', 'side')

Where I sleep at times
But that is beside the point

Then I constellate my time family country
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
I’m simply inside

The long time I had a vision

('up?', 'desire')

Ask who I am to suspend
others desires

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
If I let myself see others desires

as an impure product
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
Others desires as legitimate

Then I cannot see face value
my desires were open

Out of the remnants 
I wish my desires were open

and could be mapped and weighed
a similar desire against me

an unassimilable desire against me

('ways', 'pulse')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
impulse control

I send and retrieve the impulse

deep into pathways from repeated travels

There are constant ways
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

That’s when they really take
