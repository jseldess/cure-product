('A', 'eat')

Arrayed
too sunny to eat ice cream

All of the time
But I can’t let myself treat 

And as an extension of the values
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

BREAK
Then I can’t presume to treat others

And make myself a visible
executive breath

After having been contented
was not just a defeat

Attributable or
Where I put it beating

A person from a distance
execute breath

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
of the habits I create

Aspirational strategy
of the habits they create

ASPIRATING VISIONS
of the habits they create.

As an extension of the values
That company creates a life

All that I can think I want
it was not just a defeat

A defeated
And from that great distance

COPY DREAM 
And from a great distance

And for an ungraspable time
for the creation of the universe

CONTRACT
burrowed about from repeated travels

Aligned or not with my interests

('agreed', 'stays')

and to which I’ve agreed
own stays brought loyal

and to which the plan agreed
own that stays brought loyal

that agreed one of rest
that stays brought loyal

that agreed home
home stays brought loyal

that agreed to one the people
own stays bought loyal

that agreed one best
bought stays own loyal


('all', 'high')

I’ll get there eventually
way high up in the inter

Falling off the edge of the face
I’ll pull my data higher up

eventually 
high up in the internet

Falling from this distance
way high up in the internet

Face falling off the edge of the face
higher up in the results

results eventually
high in the content architecture

Then fall then summer
I’ll pull myself higher up

Falling from my face
your bid to the next highest ranked network

They are called aspirational
The sun high enough to enter directly 

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
The sun high enough to strike directly

over the hooves and buildings across the alley

('And', 'he')

And put in place as though stationary
I step off the edge

And as an extension of the values
The South Carolina primary 

And make myself a visible
higher up in the internet

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

And we had to say goodbye to her there
she lay under the grass

And need out in front purchase
Under the last principle

And read out in front
Even the children

And from a weak distance
where I need gravity

And for an ungraspable time
they can be waived

And reached up the screen
there wasn’t any television 

And from that great distance
around the dogs and lillies

And from a great distance
While we’re up in the sky

And we could inhabit the room easy
Or alter of course the time anyway


('around', 'else')

Spinning around the heart
If you have confidence regardless all else

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

around the dogs and lillies
and elsewhere my memory

More reasons around my country 
and elsewhere my memory of you

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
elsewhere by my memory

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
By my memory elsewhere


('aside', 'pulse')

aside from the retinas
I send and retrieve the impulse

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

where I send and relive aside
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

where I send and retrieve aside
the impulse for my own purposes

where I stand aside
the impulse to my purpose

aside the impulse to my purpose
the impulse my own prospects

where I stand aside and retrieve
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

where I am aside at least

('back', 'walk')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Before we walk across the wide field

So I went back to sleep
Before we walk across the wide opening

I keep turning back again myself
there was no walking along the pleasure

as far back as my history heard
I walk up and don’t work anymore

for to tire as far back as my history
walking into percents blending themselves

I came back to me

('between', 'themselves')

between bills and stuffed animals
battery dawn nights blending themselves

I hear it between bills and stuff
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I can hear it between bills and stuff
talking into percents bending themselves

between that day
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

between tracked and buffered
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

tracked between buffered and sizes
battery dawn nights ending themselves

between cereal and economic

('call', 'else')

not calling or echoing for once
If you have confidence regardless all else

Which can be called confidence
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

though it was most emphatically that
and elsewhere my memory of you

to take the call
elsewhere by my memory

The many transparent pixel calls
By my memory elsewhere

recalling aside
in memory elsewhere


('children', 'any')

On a snow day with my children
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

my children’s consumption
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

only fragments of time with my children
at any time it can drift again

To my children Walt Whitman
Or the company

Even the children
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

my possession of my children
if there is anything 

speech my possession of my children
The many transparent pixel calls


('clear', 'simple')

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
simple black spots

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in the simple act of reading

Can I clear it through emphatic seizure
though it is not a simple act

You can clear it also through static seizure
The simple act opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure

('days', 'reason')

I argued the days felt longer
with little reason to move

The days were long
with little reasons to aspiration

The days long aligned
with little reasons to move

The days were long aligned
with little reason to aspiration

The days are long
embodied with little reason

at least most days
and could be inflected with reasons


('decision', 'now')

the planning process for decisions
out in the snow fall

attributable decisions
even when close to my knowing

forgetting decisions 
who knows the way

decisioned to learn 
who knows how to turn it off

decisioned to learn back
that their knowing

decisions that can be attributable

('feel', 'product')

conversations with our feelings
What is an impure product

conversation with our feelings
as a cure product

drifting does not feel an exception
as a pure product

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
an impure product

I tried to feel the key values extending 
the least productive of myself

But my not feeling the memory aside

('form', 'rights')

There are performance reviews
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

in the form filled offered in trust
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

drawn formerly rights blended themselves
drawn formerly rights

dawn formerly nights ended themselves
drawn formerly rights ended themselves

shone formerly a long time
where rights ended themselves

drawn formerly along 

('formerly', 'me')

already formerly a long time
I have a memory between the day

dawn already formerly nights 
formerly a long time they were on

A way formerly like this one
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

dawn formerly
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

with dawn already formerly nights 
by my memory

which I feel formerly about for
washed by my memory

formerly along time they were on
I presume to others

formerly a way
But my not feeling the memory inside

formerly a way like this one
The other end of means

formerly away
formerly my way 

shone formerly a long time
formerly my way to the elections

formerly along my say to the elections
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time

drawn formerly rights
drawn formerly rights ended themselves

formerly along the time they were on
I have them trust in me


('from', 'through')

Then fall then summer from my face
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling from this distance
Back up through the results

out from below the fold
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I get from here through there
I get here through there

get from here through there
I get through there

And from a weak distance

('incoming', 'he')

I want to find a way to block it incoming
Before anyone buys up the opening

I want to find a way to block incoming
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

I can find a way to block it incoming
Of course there is a direction

I can find a way to block incoming 
Before anyone has walked across the opening

I can find a way to block it in the incoming stream
than in the incoming stream

from the incoming stream
as long as I have access to the code

or the incoming stream
The sun isn’t up 


('know.', 'eat')

who knows the way
I reach repeated expressions first

how can I know without direction
But I can’t let myself treat 

I even know what I would find
it was not just a defeat

even when close to my knowing
And from that great distance

knowing the constituents
for the creation of the universe

that their knowing

('literal', 'up?')

and literally moved
without really agreeing

as it was designed literally
where I send and relive would be held

and literally unproved
I stand and retrieve the impulse

literally unproved 
they should rise up

myself moved literally as it is
and literally moved about

when it is not literal
in the form filled offered in trust

I literally moved
it can be uncomfortable 

and move them literally with me
without their agreement

literally move
without really needing

and it’s not literal
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

literally moved
redundant

what literally moved
about the site

not literally moved about
washed I answered about

not literally moved
which I feel formerly about for


('longer', 'so')

I argued the days felt longer
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I argued the days were longer
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I agrued the days were longer
My associations

I argued that the days were longer
with little reasons to aspiration

without longer damage
so that nothing had gravity

without any longer damage
some sort of a futile joyous white sun


('nor', 'now')

into the minority proportion of time
On a snow day with my children

over the long line I would honor
out in the snow

nor work in this way daily
Right now I’m the cart

the simple act of honoring an accountant
even when close to my knowing

nor envy honest work
knowing the constituents

which had on honor to be told
who knows the way

Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor
that their knowing


('one', 'act')

I have entered my phone
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
In the light of retroactive

Before anyone buys up the opening
One day was actually

Actually one day there is direction
I was enjoined to act again myself

Did he carry one virtue to excess
I was enjoined to act again

Having transitioned from leisure to work
and strategies not tactics

reflexing indented in my phone
we had inhabited actually

nor envy honest work
The ends of my transactions

from no one point
to the ends of my transactions

that agreed one of rest
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

in need one in that best own
to the ends of actions

A way formerly like this one
It’s not marshal exactly

Formerly a way like this one
the other end transactions

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
the other end of actions

Like this one other end of transactions
to the other end of actions

I end up Bach forty-one seconds in
to the other end of transactions

shone formerly a long time
I turn not sad exactly

I had entered my phone
I return not sad exactly

that agreed to one the people
before I act on them


('or', 'may')

into the minority proportion of time
may not be ingrained

off the end of the world
may not be engrained

as far back as my history heard
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

in the form filled offered in trust
and maybe regrettable 

before I act on them
and maybe forgettable

forgettable

('out', 'purpose')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
by no ventillation my purpose

out in the snow
until my purpose up in the sky

barely outlines
until I purpose the horizon

without the long time I was accounting
of my purpose in versing

without ensuing damage
In conversing of my purpose

purchased out
My purpose up in the sky

And need out in front purchase
Until my purpose 

Having been purchased out of you
I tell you my purposes

without consumer damage
Where I host my purposes

The South Carolina primary 
I have entered my purposes

without really speaking
the impulse for my own purposes

without really breaking
the impulse to my purpose

burrowed about from repeated travels
to the other end of my purpose

I answered about
aside the impulse to my purpose

answered about 
for my own purposes

which I feel formerly about for

('own', 'sleep.')

in a sharp downward turn 
where I sleep at times

In a sharp downard turn
That’s where I sleep at times

the down arrow
Interrupted sleep or

I brought my head down
While I should be sleeping

I brought my qualities down
Looking back while I should be sleeping

which I brought down with qualities
While I should sleep not back in the results

I put my bread down
like flattening sleep 

even when close to my owning

('possessions', 'form')

I speak to them my possessions
with dawn already formerly nights 

I speak them of my possessions
in the form filled offered in trust

speak them of my possessions
A way formerly like this one

phrase them of my possessions
which I feel formerly about for

I stay the right of my possessions 
own best form

possessions
own best form to ourselves

phrase them of our possessions

('reason', 'full')

reasons resources
It keeps coming down thankfully

with reasons
I am full of potential

with little reason to move
with full potential to movement

with little reasons to aspiration
full of aspirations

with little reason to aspiration
full of potential

embodied with little reason
full of the missing words

More reasons around my country 
still carefully

and could be inflected with reasons

('remnant', 'he')

out of remnant pages
and my heart rate

Out of the remnant ruins
and my heartrate

Out of the remnants 
Out of the remnants of later pages

Out of the remnant pages
Out of the remnant pages of later ruins

remnant continuous pages
with my head

out of remnant ages
higher up in the results


('see', 'decisions')

Then I cannot see face value
the planning process for decisions

I see the back of falling values
attributable decisions

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
forgetting decisions 

Having seen more than 
that decisions can be attributable

being seen by me
decisions that can be attributable

Having seen more than I can remember 
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
in that decisions can be attributable

Or can have seen offering possession

('send', 'side')

I send and retrieve the impulse
But my not feeling the memory aside

where I send and relive aside
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

where I send and retrieve aside
where I stand aside

where I send and relive would be held
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

where I send and relive
But my not feeling the memory inside

where I send and retrieve relive
where I am aside

where I send and receive
by the side of the hosting service


('themselves', 'resume')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
and can’t presume to need

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I resume unassimilable visions

talking into percents bending themselves
I resume attributable visions

walking into percents blending themselves
I continue to presume

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
I presume to others

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
So I presume the offers already


('they', 'best')

When they really take hold of my finger
in need one in that best own

formerly a long time they were on
need one in best own

formerly along time they were on
that in need one best own

in the long time they were on
own best form

that they were visible
own best form to ourselves

that they were divisible

('this', 'now')

We’ll have coffee this morning
On a snow day with my children

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
who knows the way

Falling from this distance
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

attesting this is a chance
Right now I’m the cart

that I was the arm of this
I take it out in the snow fall

nor work in this way daily
knowing the constituents

A way formerly like this one
who knows how to turn it off

Formerly a way like this one
who know the ways to their other end

To the other end of transactions like this
that their knowing

that this is possible

('Though', 'though')

Though there are quarters goals
As though stationary and a destination

Though how can you know without direction
though there are quarters with goals

Though in not many acts
though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts
though it is not a simple act

Though we are waiting for her
I thought

Though we are breaking 
after though there’s no memory

Though we can’t help waiting
I answered what I thought


('us', 'bill')

Ask who I am to suspend
between bills and stuffed animals

asynchronous 
I hear it between bills and stuff

The ventillation rushes on
I can hear it between bills and stuff

I reuse unassimilable visions
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I reuse indelible tracks 
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

I want to cite a poem so usual
billowing in the cloud

I have them trust in me
until the bill came

a futile joyous white sun
the bill my detuning 


('values', 'rate')

And as an extension of the values
and my heart rate

The CEO tells me to embody values
Strategy comes before morning

I see only the back of falling values
and strategies not tactics

I see the back of falling values
Aspirational strategy

I can see only the back of falling values
I aspirate with little vision

As an extension of the values

('we', 'came')

between bills and stuffed animals
I invited most of what came next

The days were long
I came back to me

we had to say goodbye
until the bill came

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
and came home to rewind inflections

we ask say in that case
and came home to rewind

I assumed that they were divisible

('you.', 'bill')

Though how can you know without direction
I hear it between bills and stuff

That you can see only the back of
I can hear it between bills and stuff

where you can earn more 
I can hear them between bills and stuff

You can hear it also through your leisure
billowing in the cloud

a futile joyous white sun
until the bill came

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
the bill my detuning 

the young ripples inaudibly
between bills and stuffed animals
