('again', 'us')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
asynchronous 

at any time it can drift again
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I keep turning back again myself
In a vertiginous dream

a similar desire against me
Remnant continuous pages

I was enjoined to act again
The ventillation rushes on

blue and sun again a second, then night
So stay with us

I let it remind me again
I used my technology


('along', 'so')

bring your child along
who are so fresh and agile

The days lined along company
with little reason to aspiration

there was no walking along the pleasure
no solid ground to continue along

there was no walking along
than solid ground

because there was no solid ground to continue along
If I take some different measure

formerly along time they were on
by in the sound privacy

formerly along my say to the elections
by in the sounded privacy

along cables
also didn’t really move

shone formerly along time
buy in the sound privacy


('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'product')

I can’t fix them without direction
as a cure product

and can’t presume to need
as a pure product

Then I can’t presume to need others
as an impure product

Then I can’t presume to feed others
an impure product

Then I can’t presume to treat others
the least productive of myself

I can’t remember them

('could', 'us')

and could be mapped and weighed
in a continuous vertiginous dream

could map to the dimnsions of a graph
Remnant continuous pages

until I could not tire 
I want to cite a poem so usual

until I could not be tired
I have them trust in me

I could consume the dream
Articles all around us

I could in effect credit
I used my technology

and we could inhabit the room easy
in the form filled offered in trust

and could be inflected with reasons

('down', 'low')

in a sharp downward turn 
slow

In a sharp downard turn
slow asynchronous

to the down arrow
to the pillow

the down arrow
low in the content architecture

which I brought down with qualities
Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture

I click my zipcode up where it should be down

('face', 'track')

Then I cannot see face value
I reuse indelible tracks 

white spots on a black surface
The first track

black spots on a white surface
I refuse indelible tracks

not many face up
I resume indelible tracks

in the face that I had
which as tracked befitted 

in the face that it had
which as tracked befitted phased

stopped light with validated faces
sizes track for asking sound


('from', 'resume')

Then fall then summer from my face
and can’t presume to need

Falling from this distance
Then I can’t presume to need others

drifting away from the task
I resume unassimilable visions

I get from here through there
I resume attributable visions

get from here through there
I continue to presume

And from a weak distance
I presume to others

from no one point
So I presume the offers already


('head', 'inter')

Without a head
way high up in the inter

I brought my head down
hold at intervals riding forward

with my head
at intervals while riding forward

I put my head down
high up in the internet

into the next level head
with internally regulated climate

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
my interfaced stand data


('here', 'low')

Where I sleep at times
slow

Of course there is a direction
slow asynchronous

I’ll get there eventually
to the pillow

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
low in the content architecture

Where I put it beating
Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture

I’ll get there ruins
out from below the fold

where I can lay claim to ruins
I am not allowed to see their face

there was no promotion
under pillowing a cloud

I get through there

('into', 'best')

into rotating directionless 
in need one in that best own

stopping into the prospect
need one in best own

step by into the prospect
that in need one best own

converting sight into a purchase
own best form

at home brought into privacy
own best form to ourselves

already brought into privacy

('It', 'IN')

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

It has been since
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON

It’s morning 
ASPIRATING

It’s not marshal exactly
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

It’s not marshall exactly
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR


('learning', 'so')

in light of learning what we see
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

I spend time online learning to code
dislocated and a person from a distance

Then I am learning to code
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

phase decision for learning
sizes track for asking sound

for learning by the prospect
sizes asking for tracking sound

a precision for learning
by in the sounded privacy


('low', 'eat')

slow
too sunny to eat ice cream

slow asynchronous
But I can’t let myself treat 

to the pillow
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

low in the content architecture
Where I put it beating

Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
executive breath

I am not allowed to see their face
of the habits they create

under pillowing a cloud
And from that great distance


('night', 'know')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
who knows the way

battery dawn nights blending themselves
how can I know without direction

blue and sun again a second, then night
I even know what I would find

dawn already formerly nights 
knowing the constituents

with dawn already formerly nights 
who knows how to turn it off

battery dawn nights 
who know the ways to their other end

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
that their knowing


('no', 'earn')

into the minority proportion of time
in light of learning what we see

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
When we had jobs that were to earn

not one virtue to excess
I spend time online learning to code

Then I cannot see face value
learned without too much difficulty to code

I am told by no ventillation
Then I am learning to code

So that I notice I am the only one
I am learning to code

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
where you can earn more 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
decisioned to learn 

and it’s not literal
decisioned to learn back

But my not feeling the memory inside
phase decision for learning

who knows the way
I learned my location

that their knowing
for learning by the prospect

for a while not to listen

('possession', 'learn')

I speak to them my possessions
decisioned to learn 

speak them of my possessions
decisioned to learn back

phrase them of my possessions
phase decision for learning

I speak them of my possessions
my daughter will learn 

my possession of my children
for learning by the prospect

speech my possession of my children
I learned my location

possessions people

Or can have seen offering possession

('privacy', 'learn')

at home brought into privacy
in light of learning what we see

by in the sound privacy
phase decision for learning

buy in the surrounded privacy
decisioned to learn 

by in the sounded privacy
for learning by the prospect

bought in the sounded privacy
I learned my location

buy in the sound privacy
decisioned to learn back

bought in the surrounded privacy 

('reason', 'up?')

reasons resources
in a sharp downward turn 

with reasons
not one virtue to excess

with little reason to move
I argued that the days were longer

with little reasons to aspiration
And as an extension of the values

with little reasons to move
full of aspirations

with little reason to aspiration
full of potential

embodied with little reason
As an extension of the values

Toward the start informally given my reasons
around my country 

More reasons around my country 
I have entered my purposes

and could be inflected with reasons
decisions that can be attributable


('ruins', 'up?')

of later ruins
I brought my qualities down

Out of the remnant ruins
of later results

Out of the back page ruins
low in the content architecture

Out of the remnant pages of later ruins
Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture

I’ll get there ruins
Then the sun isn’t up 

of later pages ruins results
Eventually

out of the fifth page ruins
high up in the results

where I can lay claim to ruins
I’ll get there eventually

where I can claim to see the ruins
to see the ruins


('see', 'could')

Then I cannot see face value
and could be mapped and weighed

where I can claim to see the ruins
until I could not tire 

under the last seen principle
I could consume the dream

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
and we could inhabit the room easy

Having seen more than 
and could be inflected with reasons

being seen by me

('step', 'prospect')

I step off the edge
The prospects there already

I step over the edge
the impulse for my own prospects

step in by the prospect
phase decisioned by the prospect

phase decision step in
for learning by the prospect

step by into the prospect
stopping into the prospect

stepping in the middle
The prospect for careening attached

stepping off into the middle

('then', 'front')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Then fall then summer
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

blue and sun again a second, then night
in front of the set afternoon

then I cannot see face value
in front of the set of regulations

Then I continue to dream then
And need out in front purchase

I continued to dream then
behind or out front or up above


('there', 'are')

The prospects there already
Though there are quarters goals

Actually one day there is direction
there are quarters 

We can rest there in them with their goals
though there are quarters with goals

with goals I find there
who are so fresh and agile

I’ll get there eventually
There are quarterly goals

I’ll get there ruins
barely outlines

there was no promotion
The days are long

that potential is there for you
but they are black spots

there was no television to hear
There are spots waiting

if there is anything 
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

there wasn’t any television 
still carefully

after though there’s no memory
though we are waiting for her

Is there a baby and a bear
There are constant ways

Formerly away there are constant ways
The many transparent pixel calls

my ethereal economic relations
 as points which are my interest 

The offers there already
careening between the preambles


('Thou', 'up?')

Though there are quarters goals
They’re just not mine

Though how can you know without direction
though there are quarters with goals

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
If I take a different measure

Though in not many acts
Though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts
Though it is not many simple acts

Though it is not a simple act
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Though we are waiting for her
I thought

Though we are breaking 
and literally unproved

Though we are waiting 
all parties would be held

Though we can’t help waiting
Though we can’t help waiting for her


('tire', 'up?')

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
And as an extension of the values

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
I agrued the days were longer

The entire company
but it continued

Since I had to hold the entire company
I argued the days were longer

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
with full potential to movement

until I could not tire 
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

until I could not be tired
You can hear it also through your leisure

for to tire as far back as my history
you need history

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies


('To', 'decision')

To my children Walt Whitman
the planning process for decisions

Tomorrow
attributable decisions

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
forgetting decisions 

To the ends of transactions
decisioned to learn 

To the ends of my transactions
decisioned to learn back

To the right of determined elections
decisions that can be attributable


('too', 'he')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

too sunny to eat ice cream
Then fall then summer from my face

emerging this year from too much standing water
to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water

learned without too much difficulty to code
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

Selma knows too 
Though we are waiting for her

Selma helps too
The way that I was going

My daughter helps too
to the ends of my transactions


('us', 'he')

Ask who I am to suspend
But that is beside the point

I am to end my connections suspended live
Where I sleep at times

I suspend live connections to you
Whereas direction is beside the point

I suspend my connections to you
The dogs and lillies

Suspended live in connections to you
I step off the edge

asynchronous 
Before we walk across the wide field

because it was really dark
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
Of course there is a direction

They’re just not mine
Actually one day there is direction

russling to stay still
I can’t fix them without direction

slow asynchronous
others desires

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
here described

I want to cite a poem so usual
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

was not just a defeat
 and time in the train

In a vertiginous dream
Then the sun isn’t up

in a continuous vertiginous dream
and my heart rate

You use the most essential parts
Even before the lesson starts

In a continuous theme
I put my head down

Remnant continuous pages
Back in the results pages

The ventillation rushes on
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

I just got a letter
It’s the third letter from the end

So stay with us
And as an extension of the values

but it continued rippling muscle
The days were long aligned

I reuse unassimilable visions
talking into pheasants bending themselves

because there was no solid ground to continue along
walking along the measure

I reuse indelible tracks 
The long time I had a vision

I refuse indelible tracts
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I refuse indelible contracts
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

it was not just a defeat
advancing the time

I have them trust in me
in the long time they were on

a futile joyous white sun
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses

Articles all around us
Under the last principle of purchasing power

I wear suspenders
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I used my technology
I continued to dream then

suspenders
where I need gravity

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

in the form filled offered in trust
Elsewhere by my memory

trackers collecting data on users
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

The trackers on users
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
Where I send and relive aside

I stand and retrieve the impuse
All parties would be held

useless for not having paid

to the suggestion

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
Where in me did I host

about the sight hosting trusting
by the sight of the hosting answered about

in the form filled offered trust
washed by my memory

in the form filled offered must
pre-worn and still wash them

Where in me did I lose trust
in the form filled offered

In my heart did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

Where did we lose trust
To the ends of transactions

radiating from housing
shone from the housing


('vision', 'now')

I had me a vision
Right now I’m the cart

The planning process for visions
out in the snow

The planning process is for visionaries only
out in the snow fall

aspirating visions
I take it out in the snow fall

there wasn’t any television 
I even know what I would find

I resume unassimilable visions
even when close to my knowing

I resume attributable visions
When closed to my knowing

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
knowing the constituents

joined in my television
that their knowing

visions that can be attainable

('visions', 'bill')

The planning process for visions
I hear it between bills and stuff

aspirating visions
I can hear it between bills and stuff

I reuse unassimilable visions
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I resume unassimilable visions
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

I resume attributable visions
billowing in the cloud

attributable visions
until the bill came

visions that can be attainable
between bills and stuffed animals

revisions that can be attributable

('We', 'us')

We’ll have coffee this morning
I suspend live connections to you

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
asynchronous 

We can wrestle them with their goals
They’re just not mine

We had to say goodbye there
articles all around us

We had to buy there
I wear suspenders

We had inhabited actually
in the form filled offered in trust

We got paid one way by a voice
trackers collecting data on users

We ask say in that case

('while', 'he')

Looking back while I should be sleeping
with my head

at intervals while riding forward
I brought my head down

while wrapped in static
You can hear it also through your leisure

while wrapped in explicit static
The long time I was a vision

while we’re wrapped in static
until I purpose the horizon

while consuming damage
I continued to dream then

I answered while interfaced
battery dawn nights ending themselves

for a while to listen already
So I presume the offers at home already

for a while to listen 
I resume the offers at home

for a while not to listen
presume the offers at 

For a while I think I don’t listen
traffick is there nonetheless


('would', 'time.')

over the long line I would honor
over the time line I was on

I would like your zip code
I spend time online learning to code

but would I love her the same
The long time I had a vision

What would I feel without that goal
without the long time I was accounting

I even know what I would find
So I constellate the time family country

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
or alter of course the time anyway

all parties would be held
formerly a long time they were on

people would be helped
until a happier time found
