('after', 'now')

after having been contented
out in the snow

upsent in the afternoon
out in the snow fall

an upsent afternoon
out in the snow falling face value

in front of the set afternoon
I take it out in the snow fall

that having been after content
even when close to my knowing

I captured an afterimage
When closed to my knowing

I came after my past
knowing the constituents

after though there’s no memory
who knows how to turn it off


('again', 'joined')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I was enjoined to act again myself

at any time it can drift again
I was enjoined to act again

blue and sun again a second, then night
I was enjoined to act

I am bid to act again
I am enjoined to act again

I was bid to act again myself
I was enjoined to act against

I was enjoying acting against myself
joined in my television


('along', 'what')

bring your child along
I invited most of what came next

The days lined along company
I even know what I would find

formerly along time they were on
I answered what I thought

formerly along my say to the elections
I assumed what I draw

along cables
I answered what I thought about

shone formerly along time
to return what I bought


('any', 'enjoined')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
I was enjoined to act again myself

at any time it can drift again
I was enjoined to act again

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I was enjoined to act

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I am enjoined to act again

The entire company
I was enjoined to act against

The days aligned for company

('assume', 'ring')

I assumed it was visible
interferring 

I assumed 
firing and connecting somewhere

I assumed what I draw
The prospect for veering healthily

I assume the offers reliable
Or can have seen offering possession

I assumed that they were divisible
seen having or offering possession

I assume possession to others
in school and can see offering

I assume the offers revisitable
can have seen offering possession


('between', 'has')

between bills and stuffed animals
conversations with our purchase

I hear it between bills and stuff
in traversing my purchase

I can hear it between bills and stuff
purchased out

between that day
if that has anything

I have a memory between the day
I have entered my purchases

between the drug store and the 
phase decisioned by the prospect

between tracked and buffered
converting sight into a purchase

tracked between buffered and sizes
for my own purchases

between cereal and economic
at the site of a purchase

between the private ambles

('bill', 'eat')

between bills and stuffed animals
too sunny to eat ice cream

I hear it between bills and stuff
executive breath

I can hear it between bills and stuff
it was not just a defeat

billowing in the cloud
And from that great distance

until the bill came
was not just a defeat

the bill my detuning 

('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'but')

I can’t fix them without direction
but not impart cynicism

and can’t presume to need
Attributable or

That can’t be glimpsed
but it continued

Though we can’t help waiting
that decisions can be attributable

I can’t remember them
decisions that can be attributable

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

('could', 'he')

and could be mapped and weighed
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

until I could not tire 
What was the last time

until I could not be tired
as far back as my history heard

until I could not be hired
until I purpose the horizon

I could in effect credit
I get through there

I could consume the dream
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

and we could inhabit the room easy
or alter of course the time anyway

and could be inflected with reasons
stopping in the middle


('else', 'up?')

If you have confidence regardless all else
upset by Gingrich

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
While we’re up in the sky 

and elsewhere my memory
The South Carolina primary 

and elsewhere my memory of you
I have entered my purchases

elsewhere my purposes
washed my purchases

elsewhere by my memory
answered about 

By my memory elsewhere
I answered about

in memory elsewhere
radiating from housing

but for memory elsewhere
I answered what I thought

in memory persisting elsewhere
I answered what I thought about


('find', 'now')

So I find myself at home
On a snow day with my children

I want to find a way to block it incoming
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

with goals I find there
for how can you know without direction

what I find there
Right now I’m the cart

Companies increasingly find 
I take it out in the snow fall

I even know what I would find
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking


('formerly', 'into')

already formerly a long time
Then I saw into you

A way formerly like this one
deep into pathways from repeated travels

with dawn already formerly nights 
stopping into the prospect

dawn already formerly nights 
step by into the prospect

formerly a way
converting sight into a purchase

which I feel formerly about for
into liminal reflexing


('from', 'really')

Then fall then summer from my face
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

from the incoming stream
When they really take hold of my finger

out from below the fold
without really agreeing

breaking from my constituents
without really branding 

from no one point
also didn’t really move

radiating from housing

('going', 'up?')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
If I take a different measure

The way that she is going
The constituents would be helped

The way that I am going
But my not feeling the memory inside

The way that I was going
Though we are waiting for her

way I was going 
I end up Bach

A way I was going
to the other end of my purpose


('has', 'you.')

conversations with our purchase
Though how can you know without direction

It has been since
You can hear it also through your leisure

in traversing my purchase
where you can earn more 

purchased out
I tell you my purposes

I tell you the weight of my purchases
I tell you the weight of my purposes

Is the weight of my purchases
I tell you where I need gravity

if that has anything
This is your voice 

I have entered my purchases
This is your chance

the impulse for my own purchases
the young ripples inaudibly

phase decisioned by the prospect

('have', 'top')

We’ll have coffee this morning
stopped light with validated variegated fields

before we can have a retroactive
stopping into the prospect

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
stopped light with validated fields

I have turned it off
stopped light with validated faces

I have them lost
stopping in the middle

I have seen more than I can remember
stopping off in all directions

Or can have seen offering possession

('her', 'sight')

Where I sleep at times
In my sight 

there was no promotion
in pursuit of the sight

I get through there
converting sight

Where in me did I host
my sight hosting

Where in me did I lose
about the sight hosting trusting

Where in me did I loose
converting sight into a purchase

with her waves

('into', 'side')

into rotating directionless 
But that is beside the point

into the stream of pictures
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

into the minority proportion of time
I’m simply inside

interjecting into the stream
aside from the retinas

talking into pheasants bending themselves
actually considering the end

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
But my not feeling the memory aside

entered into my purposes
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

deep into pathways from repeated travels
where I am aside

stopping into the prospect
by the side of the hosting service

step by into the prospect
But my not feeling the memory inside

converting sight into a purchase
where I send and relive aside

into liminal reflexing

('It\xe2\x80\x99s', 'he')

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
The ventillation rushes on

It’s morning 
but the sun isn’t up

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
It’s the third letter from the end

It’s not marshal exactly
the other end transactions

It’s not marshall exactly
the way that I was going


('literal', 'up?')

and literally moved
without really agreeing

as it was designed literally
where I send and relive would be held

and literally unproved
I stand and retrieve the impulse

literally unproved

I literally moved

('long', 'very')

as long as I have access to the code
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I argued the days felt longer
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I agrued the days were longer
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
embodied everyday

The days are long
They have very many choices

already formely a long time

('man', 'bill')

as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
I hear it between bills and stuff

not many face up
I can hear them between bills and stuff

though not many facts up in the sky
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

in not many tracks up in the sky
I cannot hear it between bills

Though in not many acts
between bills and stuffed animals

that of the man with the dyed blond hair
the bill my detuning 


('night', 'here')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll get there eventually

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Of course there is a direction

blue and sun again a second, then night
there was no promotion

I had nightmares though
There was very little physical activity

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I get through there

dawn already formerly nights 
if there is anything 

last night
Where in me did I host

with dawn already formerly nights 
Elsewhere by my memory

battery dawn nights 
There are constant ways

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
There are no constant waves

nights
where rights ended themselves

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in memory elsewhere

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
where lights blended themselves


('no', 'while')

into the minority proportion of time
Looking back while I should be sleeping

in a continuous vertiginous dream
at intervals while riding forward

not back in the results
while wrapped in static

until I could not be tired
while wrapped in explicit static

until I could not be hired
while consuming damage

I used my technology
I answered while interfaced

between cereal and economic
for a while to listen already

for a while not to listen
For a while I think I don’t listen

traffick is there nonetheless

('now', 'side')

On a snow day with my children
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

who knows the way
I’m simply inside

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
aside from the retinas

I take it out in the snow fall
actually considering the end

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
But my not feeling the memory aside

knowing the constituents
by the side of the hosting service

who knows how to turn it off
But my not feeling the memory inside

who know the ways to their other end
By my feeling the memory inside

that their knowing

('off', 'visions')

I step off the edge
The planning process for visions

off the end of the world
aspirating visions

off the end myself
aspirating with visions

off the end
embodied with little visions

from which to step off
aspirating with little visions

falling off the encoded end
I reuse unassimilable visions

falling off the end
I resume unassimilable visions

eroded off the end
I resume attributable visions

Sweets and coffee and juice
visions that can be attainable

I presume the offers
revisions that can be attributable

So I presume the offers already
at home visions can be attainable

I offer to you

('out', 'themselves')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
battery dawn nights blending themselves

about my children’s consumption
talking into pheasants bending themselves

without the long time I was accounting
talking into percents bending themselves

without the long time I was on accounting
walking into percents blending themselves

without ensuing damage
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

burrowed about from repeated travels
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

I answered about
battery dawn nights ending themselves

I answered what I thought about
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

about 

('own', 'were')

in a sharp downward turn 
When we had jobs that were to earn

I brought my head down
my desires were open

which I brought down with qualities
I wish my desires were open

I brought my qualities down
I argued the days were longer

even when close to my owning
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

the impulse for my own prospects
answered about 

own stays brought loyal
formerly a long time they were on

in need one in that best own
I answered what I thought

own that stays brought loyal
I answered about

for my own purchases
in the long time they were on

for my own purposes
that they were visible

own best form to ourselves
that they were divisible


('presume', 'There')

So I presume the offers already
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

and can’t presume to need
There are quarterly goals

Then I can’t presume to need others
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I continue to presume
There are spots waiting

I presume to others
There are constant ways

I presume the offers

('seconds', 'up?')

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

I end up Bach forty-one seconds in
But my not feeling the memory inside

Forty-one seconds in
to the other end of my purpose

44 seconds inside
and end up in Bach

44 seconds in 
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

I end up 44 seconds in
I stand and retrieve the impulse around


('set', 'you.')

upset by Gingrich
if you have providence to excess

in front of the set afternoon
That you can see only the back of

in front of the set of regulations
your bid to the next highest ranked network

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

Um, upset by Gingrich
This is your choice 

presets

('there', 'attributable')

The prospects there already
I resume attributable visions

I get through there
attributable visions

I get from here through there
that decisions can be attributable

Is there a baby and a bear
decisions that can be attributable

The offers there already
revisions that can be attributable

traffick is there nonetheless
forgetting decisions that can be attributable


('this', 'most')

We’ll have coffee this morning
though it was most emphatically that

attesting this is a chance
You use the most essential parts

emerging this year from standing water
I invited most of what came next

that I was the arm of this
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

A way formerly like this one
which feels most comfortable

Formerly a way like this one
mostly along cables

that this is possible

('though', 'use')

As though stationary and a destination
You use the most essential parts

I had nightmares though
I reuse unassimilable visions

though not many freeze up
I used my technology

I thought
trackers collecting data on users

though we are still breaking in
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

after though there’s no memory

('us', 'stay')

Ask who I am to suspend
wrestling to stay still

russling to stay still
So stay with us

but it continued rippling muscle
own stays brought loyal

in the form filled offered in trust
own that stays brought loyal

radiating from housing
I stay the right of my elections

I have them trust in me
home stays brought loyal


('wash', 'up?')

washed by my memory
all parties would be held

washed my memory
I thought

washed my purchases
I have entered my purposes

still wash conserving
still carefully

washed
I answered about

washed I answered about
after though there’s no memory

so still washed
in the form filled offered must

pre-worn and still wash them
Where in me did I lose trust


('would', 'any')

over the long line I would honor
Or the company

but would I love her the same
there wasn’t any television 

I even know what I would find
not many face up

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
or alter of course the time anyway

all parties would be held
if there is anything 

people would be helped
They have very many choices

people would prevent
latency which doesn’t mean anything


('you.', 'up?')

Though how can you know without direction
though there are quarters with goals

for how can you know without direction
slow asynchronous

You can hear it also through your leisure
I’ll get there eventually

bring your child along
without imparting the cynicism

if you have providence to excess
which can be pronounced 

If you have confidence regardless all else
upset by Gingrich

May I have your zip code
I would like your zip code

That you can see only the back of
an upsent afternoon

your bid to the next highest ranked network
the next network in your ranking

since you can imagine movement
I argued that the days were longer

where you can earn more 
and continue along having 

you need history
until I could not be tired

a futile joyous white sun
I shivered looking up

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
black spots on a white surface

I tell you my purposes
And for an ungraspable time

I tell you the weight of my purchases
until I purpose up in the sky

I tell you the weight of my purposes
weight of my purposes

I tell you where I need gravity
Is the weight of my purchases

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
Not even a [blank] would elect to be

This is your voice 
To neither study

This is your choice 
To substitute neither study

This is your chance
if you have providence

the young ripples inaudibly
I have them trust in me
