('act', 'code')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
as long as I have access to the code

One day was actually
May I have your zip code

I was enjoined to act again
learned without too much difficulty to code

and strategies not tactics
falling off the encoded end

actually considering the end
encoded off the end

I refuse indelible tracts
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

we had inhabited actually
zipcode

to the ends of actions

('again', 'now')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
On a snow day with my children

at any time it can drift again
Right now I’m the cart

I was enjoined to act again myself
out in the snow

I keep turning back again myself
out in the snow fall

I am bid to act again
I take it out in the snow fall

I let it remind me again
knowing the constituents


('already', 'found')

So I presume the offers already

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
found dated for my own purchases

already formely a long time
and found inundated

already formerly a long time
and found redundant

with dawn already formerly nights 
So I found myself at home

already brought into privacy

('back', 'at')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
into rotating directionless 

So I went back to sleep
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

I keep turning back again myself
and my heart rate

Out of the back page ruins
Where I put it beating

Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
of later ruins

Looking back while I should be sleeping
at intervals while riding forward

I keep turning back
That’s when they really take

not back in the results
hold at intervals riding forward

back up through results
To that impossible place

So I was advised to back up
out of later results

I see only the back of falling values
What the next step

I see only the back
of the habits I create

I see the back of the planning process
What’s the next step

I see only the back of my habits
Aspirational strategy

I can see only the back of falling values
of the habits they create

I can see only the back of their economic value
That you can see only the back of

then I can see only the back values
they create

as far back as my history heard
What was the last time

for to tire as far back as my history
while wrapped in explicit static

for as far back as my history
flattening my reception

I came back to me
I watch a movie

decisioned to learn back
I designated 


('constituents', 'up?')

The constituents would be helped
for my own purchases

The constituents 
without really speaking

to constituents
literally unproved 

the constituents should rise up
and drowned inundated

breaking from my constituents
But my not feeling the memory inside

from my constituents
and latently from constituents

latently from constituents 
only from constituents

with latency from constituents
would speak willingly 

constituents
and around redundant

knowing the constituents
and found redundant


('decisions', 'our')

the planning process for decisions
with four key value pairs

attributable decisions
or alter of course the time anyway

forgetting decisions 
Who throws contours away

that decisions can be attributable
phrase them of our possessions

decisions that can be attributable
own best form to ourselves

forgetting decisions that can be attributable

('desire', 'eat')

others desires
But I can’t let myself treat 

If I let myself see others desires
Then I can’t presume to treat others

drifting away needs others presume desires
I let myself treat

Others desires as legitimate
executive breath

my desires were open
Where I put it beating

I wish my desires were open
execute breath


('edge', 'you.')

I step off the edge
Though how can you know without direction

I step over the edge
for how can you know without direction

If I step over the edge
You can hear it also through your leisure

off the edge of the world
if you have providence to excess

Falling off the edge of the face
That you can see only the back of

and testing the edge and gravity
your bid to the next highest ranked network


('formerly', 'though')

already formerly a long time
I thought

dawn already formerly nights 
though it was most emphatically that

A way formerly like this one
though we are breaking in the space that it had

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
after though there’s no memory

formerly along time they were on
though we are waiting for her

formerly a way
I answered what I thought

shone formerly a long time
I answered what I thought about

shone formerly along time

('full', 'here')

It keeps coming down thankfully
Of course there is a direction

I am full of potential
There was very little physical activity

with full potential to movement
that potential is there for you

full of aspirations
there was no promotion

full of the missing words
here is the site of the battle of maldon

still carefully
Where in me pre-worn


('have', 'know.')

We’ll have coffee this morning
who knows the way

before we can have a retroactive
how can I know without direction

if you have providence to excess
I even know what I would find

If you have confidence regardless all else
even when close to my knowing

I have supporters
knowing the constituents

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
who knows how to turn it off

I have turned it off
who know the ways to their other end

and have no way
that their knowing

I have them lost

('her', 'product')

Where I sleep at times
an impure product

I told her a story, she drew waves.
What is an impure product

Of course there is a direction
as a cure product

others desires
as a pure product

Then I can’t presume to need others
as an impure product

drifting away needs others presume desires
the least productive of myself

where I am aside

('here', 'daughter')

Where I sleep at times
I love my daughter still

Where I take my liesure
with my daughter

Is there a baby and a bear
My daughter helps too

There are constant ways
my daughter will learn 

By my memory elsewhere
my daughter’s squirrel and chickadee joined me

in memory elsewhere

('high', 'now')

way high up in the inter
Right now I’m the cart

I’ll pull my data higher up
out in the snow

higher up in the results
out in the snow fall

your bid to the next highest ranked network
I take it out in the snow fall

The sun high enough to enter directly 
even when close to my knowing

The sun high enough to strike directly

('home', 'private')

at home brought into privacy
by the private preambles

promoting from home to a new job
between the private ambles

So I find myself at home
at home brought into private

at home visions can be attainable
brought into private messageably

I resume the offers at home already
in that all this in private is messageable

and came home to rewind inflections

('me', 'ends')

Where I sleep at times
to the ends of my transactions

I have a memory between the day
The ends of my transactions

But my not feeling the memory inside
To the ends of transactions

already formerly a long time
to the ends of actions

A way formerly like this one
to the ends

Formerly a way like this one
with her ways to the ends

formerly a way
The other ends of my transactions

By my feeling the memory inside

('night', 'IN')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

blue and sun again a second, then night

PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

('no', 'should')

into the minority proportion of time
You should ask who I am

Then I cannot see face value
While I should be sleeping

In a vertiginous dream
Looking back while I should be sleeping

in a continuous vertiginous dream
While I should sleep not back in the results

there was no promotion
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

that nothing had gravity
they should rise up

But my not feeling the memory inside

('off', 'joined')

I step off the edge
I was enjoined to act again myself

off the edge of the world
I was enjoined to act again

I am first in the office 
I was enjoined to act

off the end of the world
I am enjoined to act again

off the end myself
I was enjoined to act against

from which to step off
joined in my television

iced coffee and sun position

('one', 'vision')

I have entered my phone
I had me a vision

Having transitioned from leisure to work
The planning process for visions

reflexing indented in my phone
I resume attributable visions

As a clone, illegally conceived
there wasn’t any television 

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

nor envy honest work
joined in my television

I had entered my phone
visions that can be attainable

traffick is there nonetheless
revisions that can be attributable


('open', 'up?')

Before we walk across the wide opening
In a sharp downard turn

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
conversations with our reactions

Before anyone buys up the opening
such as I see

Before anyone walks across the opening
The sun isn’t up 

my desires were open
Out of the remnants 

I wish my desires were open
and could be mapped and weighed

The simple act opening surmounted
You can clear it also through static seizure

The simple act of opening surmounted
the simple act of honoring an accountant

in the simple act of opening a book
in the simple act of opening an accountant


('or', 'other')

into the minority proportion of time
I’ll pull myself another personality type

off the edge of the world
others desires

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I can’t presume to need others

On the other hand

I need the work

Though we are waiting for her
the other end transactions

Formerly a way like this one
The other end of means

Formerly away there are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

But my not feeling the memory inside
who know the ways to their other end

By my feeling the memory inside

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

Aligned or not with my interests
I assume possession to others

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

Out of remnant pages

Ruins results
Out of the remnant pages

not back in the results
Remnant continuous pages

Back in the results pages
of later pages ruins results

Out of the remnant pages of later ruins

high up in the results

('resume', 'he')

So I presume the offers already
The prospects there already

and can’t presume to need
others desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
In the right sense

I resume unassimilable visions
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I resume indelible tracks
What was the last time

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I resume attributable visions
The long time I had a vision

I continue to presume
I get through there

I presume to others
speak them of my possessions

I presume the offers
by the private preambles

So I resume the offers already
So I presume the offers

So I presume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home
presume the offers at 

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
I assume the offers reliable


('ring', 'you.')

interferring 
Though how can you know without direction

bring your child along
You can hear it also through your leisure

ring
if you have providence to excess

hovering above standing water
That you can see only the back of

actually considering the end
If you have confidence regardless all else

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
a futile joyous white sun

storing in surfeit
I tell you my purposes

firing and connecting somewhere
the young ripples inaudibly

The prospect for veering healthily

('seconds', 'up?')

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

I end up Bach forty-one seconds in
But my not feeling the memory inside

Forty-one seconds in

44 seconds inside
and end up in Bach

44 seconds in 
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

I end up 44 seconds in
I stand and retrieve the impulse around


('see', 'line')

Then I cannot see face value
on the time line I was on

where I can claim to see the ruins
On the timeline I was on

I see only the back of falling values
The days lined along company

under the last seen principle
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

Having seen more than 
Choose a line

('them', 'stay')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
wrestling to stay still

I can’t fix them without direction
So stay with us

I had to tell them the news
own stays brought loyal

speak them of my possessions
own that stays brought loyal

phrase them of my possessions

I speak them of my possessions
I stay the right of my elections

abjure them with determining 
I stay the right of my possessions 

I have them lost
home stays brought loyal

phrase them of our possessions

('this', 'world')

We’ll have coffee this morning
off the edge of the world

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Which can be pronounced to the world

attesting this is a chance
off the end of the world

that I was the arm of this
hauling off the end of the world

nor work in this way daily
the opinions in my world

A way formerly like this one

('time.', 'Thou')

Where I sleep at times
Though there are quarters goals

at any time it can drift again
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

The long time I had a vision
Though in not many acts

without the long time I was accounting
Though we are waiting for her

Or alter of course the time anyway
Though we are breaking 

until a happier time found
Though we are waiting 

formerly a long time they were on
Though we can’t help waiting

formerly along time they were on

('track', 'if')

I reuse indelible tracks 
If I take a different measure

The first track
If I take some different measure

I refuse indelible tracks
if there is anything 

and other types of tracking technology
if you have providence

trackers collecting data on users
if that has anything

which as tracked befitted 
if only on the way to the trash


('we', 'themselves')

battery dawn nights blending themselves

Before we walk across the wide opening
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I can hear it between bills and stuff
talking into percents bending themselves

wearing trying talking into it
walking into percents blending themselves

drawn formerly rights ending themselves

and relive from burrowed travels
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

time they were on
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in the long time they were on
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

I answered what I thought
where rights ended themselves

formerly along time they were on

('you.', 'bill')

Though how can you know without direction
I hear it between bills and stuff

That you can see only the back of
I can hear it between bills and stuff

where you can earn more 
I can hear them between bills and stuff

You can hear it also through your leisure
billowing in the cloud

a futile joyous white sun
until the bill came

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
the bill my detuning 

the young ripples inaudibly
between bills and stuffed animals
