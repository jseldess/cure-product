('agreed', 'really')

and to which I’ve agreed
without really agreeing

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
without really speaking

and for which the plan agreed
without really binding

that agreed one of rest
without really needing

and to which the plan agreed
also didn’t really move

that agreed home

('around', 'IN')

Spinning around the heart
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

around my country 
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
By NATASHA SINGER

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

I stand and retrieve and pulse around

('direction', 'inter')

Whereas direction is beside the point
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Of course there is a direction
interjecting on a day ambition

One day there is direction
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

on a day there will be direction
interjecting into the stream

Actually one day there is direction
way high up in the inter

stopping off in all directions

('ended', 'draw')

I am to end my connections suspended live
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
drawn formerly a long time

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
drawn formerly rights blended themselves

dawn formerly nights ended themselves
drawn formerly rights

ended themselves
drawn formerly rights ended themselves

where rights ended themselves
drawn formerly along 


('feeling', 'act')

conversations with our feelings
before we can have a retroactive

conversation with our feelings
One day was actually

But my not feeling the memory aside
The ends of my transactions

But my not feeling the memory inside
to the ends of my transactions

By my feeling the memory inside
the other end of actions

But my feeling the memory aside
I turn not sad exactly


('front', 'work')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
nor work in this way daily

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
your bid to the next highest ranked network

in front of the set of regulations
I need the work

And need out in front purchase
nor envy honest work

behind or out front or up above

('have', 'Thou')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Though there are quarters goals

if you have providence to excess
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

If you have confidence regardless all else
Though we are waiting for her

I have a memory between the day
Though we are breaking 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Though we can’t help waiting

I have turned it off

('help', 'up?')

people would be helped
The trackers on users

The constituents would be helped
for my own purchases

all parties would be helped
all parties would be held

in the form help sale offered
In my heart did I lose trust

Bach helps turn it off
Though we are waiting for her

Selma helps too
Though we can’t help waiting

Though we can’t help waiting for her
My daughter helps too


('impulse', 'purchase')

impulse control
in traversing my purchase

I send and retrieve the impulse
the impulse for my own purchases

the impulse to my purpose
I have entered my purchases

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
sound inundated for my own purchases

I stand and retrieve the impulse
For my own purchases

the impulse my own prospects
impulse for my own purchases

the impulse for my own purposes
converting sight into a purchase

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
at the site of a purchase


('literal', 'up?')

and literally moved
without really agreeing

as it was designed literally
where I send and relive would be held

and literally unproved
I stand and retrieve the impulse

literally unproved 
they should rise up

myself moved literally as it is
and literally moved about

when it is not literal
in the form filled offered in trust

I literally moved
it can be uncomfortable 

and move them literally with me
without their agreement

literally move
without really needing

and it’s not literal
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

literally moved
redundant

what literally moved
about the site

not literally moved about
washed I answered about

not literally moved
which I feel formerly about for


('now', 'else')

On a snow day with my children
If you have confidence regardless all else

Right now I’m the cart
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

knowing the constituents
elsewhere by my memory

who knows the way
By my memory elsewhere

who knows how to turn it off
in memory elsewhere

that their knowing

('prospect', 'A')

The prospects there already
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

the impulse for my own prospects
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

the impulse my own prospects
CONTRACT

stopping into the prospect
A baby and a bear

speech that is of by prospects
Aligned or not with my interests

decisioned by the prospect
All that I own messageable

The prospect for careening attached

('resume', 'our')

So I presume the offers already
reasons resources

and can’t presume to need
bring your child along

Then I can’t presume to need others
You can hear it also through your leisure

I resume unassimilable visions
or alter of course the time anyway

I presume to others
Who throws contours away

I presume the offers

('seconds', 'up?')

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

I end up Bach forty-one seconds in
But my not feeling the memory inside

Forty-one seconds in
to the other end of my purpose

44 seconds inside
and end up in Bach

44 seconds in 
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

I end up 44 seconds in
I stand and retrieve the impulse around


('she', 'time.')

I told her a story, she drew waves.
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

A turtle fished out of the lake
I spend time online learning to code

The ventillation rushes on
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

she lay under the grass
or alter of course the time anyway

washed by my memory
formerly a long time they were on

washed my memory
until a happier time found

washed
formerly along time they were on

The way that she is going
time they were on


('them', 'literally')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
and literally moved

Then I saw them interview
as it was designed literally

I speak to them
and literally unproved

I speak to them my possessions
and move them literally with me

I literally move them
literally move

I speak them of my possessions
and literally moved about

pre-worn and still wash them
not literally moved about

so still them
not literally moved

abjure them with determining 

('they', 'A')

When they really take hold of my finger
And as an extension of the values

of the habits they create
Aspirational strategy

of the habits they create.
As an extension of the values

but they are black spots
All that I can think I want

they were on
COPY DREAM 

they can be waived
And reached up the screen

While they’re up in the sky
And for an ungraspable time

formerly a long time they were on
And we could inhabit the room easy

they should rise up
CONTRACT

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

A baby and a bear

Aligned or not with my interests

in the long time they were on

that they were visible
All that I own messageable

that they were divisible

('To', 'work')

To my children Walt Whitman
nor work in this way daily

To that impossible place
Having transitioned from leisure to work

Tomorrow 
your bid to the next highest ranked network

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
I walk up and don’t work anymore

Toward the start informally given my reasons
So I work and don’t look any

To neither study
nor envy honest work

To substitute neither study

('transactions', 'actions')

to the ends of my transactions
The ends of my transactions

To the ends of transactions
to the ends of actions

the other end transactions
to the other end of actions

The other end of transactions like this
The other ends of my transactions

The other end of my transactions
To the other end of transactions

To the other end of transactions like this
of my actions

Like this one other end of transactions
actions


('we', 'across')

between bills and stuffed animals
Before we walk across the wide field

So I went back to sleep
Before we walk across the wide opening

before we can have a retroactive
Before anyone walks across the opening

When we had jobs that were to earn
across the retinas

The days were long
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

while we’re wrapped in static
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

I assumed that they were divisible

('which', 'agreed')

which can be pronounced 
and to which I’ve agreed

which we can pronounce
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

which ran to be told
and for which the plan agreed

which feels most comfortable
that agreed one of rest

which as tracked befitted 
and to which the plan agreed

which feels more comfortable
that agreed home

which is not necessarily possible
that agreed to one the people

which as tracked befitted phased

('who', 'has')

Ask who I am to suspend
conversations with our purchase

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
It has been since

who
in traversing my purchase

who knows the way
phase decisioned by the prospect

who knows how to turn it off
He has turned it off

who throws contours a way
phase decisioned


('you', 'been')

I suspend live connections to you
It has been since

You can hear it also through your leisure
After having been contented

if you have providence to excess
that having been after content

That you can see only the back of
having been graspable

a futile joyous white sun
having been an ungraspable time

having been purchased out of you
