('A', 'As')

Arrayed
Ask who I am to suspend

Arrayed out in such a nested way
Ask who I am

Ask who I am to end my live connection
As though stationary and a destination

And put in place as though stationary
Assimilable or

A turtle fished out of the lake
Aspirational strategy

ASPIRATING VISIONS
As an extension of the values

And as an extension of the values
As a clone, illegally conceived

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
