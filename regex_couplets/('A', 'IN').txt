('A', 'IN')

Arrayed
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

BREAK
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

After having been contented
THE PLANNING PROCESS

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
ASPIRATING

Aspirational strategy
ASPIRATING VISIONS

And as an extension of the values
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

As a clone, illegally conceived
By NATASHA SINGER

A baby and a bear
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

PRELUDE (IN A MINOR WITH A RUBBY DUCKY)
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

A way formerly like this one
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

A way I was going
