The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
I’m simply inside

Actually one day there is direction
Right now I’m the cart

And as an extension of the values
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
where I’m watching my tv
