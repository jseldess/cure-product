('A', 'It')

Arrayed
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
It keeps coming down thankfully

All of the time
It has been since

And make myself a visible
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
It’s morning 

GOALS
It’s the third letter from the end

ASPIRATING
It’s not marshal exactly

PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)
It’s not marshall exactly

PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR
