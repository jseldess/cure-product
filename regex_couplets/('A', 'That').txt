('A', 'That')

Arrayed
That’s exaclty what I want for them

Actually one day there is direction
That is itself not still

As though stationary and a destination
That’s where I sleep at times

And make myself a visible
That’s when they really take

And as an extension of the values
That you can see only the back of

Aspirational strategy
That company creates a life

As an extension of the values
That I captured an afterimage

As a clone, illegally conceived
That are my right to say

Aligned or not with my interests
