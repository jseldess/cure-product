('A', 'There')

Arrayed
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

All of the time
There are quarterly goals

And as an extension of the values
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

BREAK
There was very little physical activity

As an extension of the values
There are spots waiting

And from a great distance
There are constant ways

PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR
