('A', 'Thou')

Arrayed
Though there are quarters goals

Actually one day there is direction
Though how can you know without direction

And as an extension of the values
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

All that I can think I want
Though in not many acts

A defeated
Though we are waiting for her

And we could inhabit the room easy
Though we are breaking 

All parties would be held
Though we are waiting 

CONTRACT
Though we can’t help waiting

PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR
