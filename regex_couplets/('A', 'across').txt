('A', 'across')

Arrayed
Before we walk across the wide field

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Before we walk across the wide opening

All of the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

Actually one day there is direction
across the retinas

And as an extension of the values
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

A defeated
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
