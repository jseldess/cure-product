('A', 'actions')

Arrayed
conversations with our reactions

All of the time
to the ends of my transactions

And we could inhabit the room easy
The ends of my transactions

CONTRACT
To the ends of transactions

PRELUDE (IN A MINOR WITH A RUBBY DUCKY)
to the ends of actions

A baby and a bear
the other end transactions

PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)
to the other end of actions

PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR
the other end of actions

A way I was going
to the other end of transactions

Aligned or not with my interests
