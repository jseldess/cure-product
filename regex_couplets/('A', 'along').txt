('A', 'along')

Arrayed
bring your child along

And as an extension of the values
The days lined along company

As an extension of the values
there was no walking along the pleasure

All that I can think I want
formerly along time they were on

A baby and a bear
formerly along my say to the elections

Aligned or not with my interests
shone formerly along time
