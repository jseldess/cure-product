('A', 'away')

Arrayed
drifting away

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
drifting away needs others presume desires

And as an extension of the values
drifting away from the task

And make myself a visible
Who throws contours away

PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR
Formerly away there are constant ways

A way I was going
