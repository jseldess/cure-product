('A', 'bill')

Arrayed
between bills and stuffed animals

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
I hear it between bills and stuff

And make myself a visible
I can hear it between bills and stuff

All that I can think I want
I can hear them between bills and stuff

A defeated
billowing in the cloud

COPY DREAM 
until the bill came

As a clone, illegally conceived
the bill my detuning 

Aligned or not with my interests
bills and stuffed animals

All that I own messageable
