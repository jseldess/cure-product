('A', 'but')

Arrayed
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
but not impart cynicism

And as an extension of the values
Attributable or

Assimilable or
but the sun isn’t up

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
but it continued

As an extension of the values
but it continued rippling muscle

All that I can think I want
but I can hear them

A defeated
but where is it

COPY DREAM 
I resume attributable visions

As a clone, illegally conceived
that decisions can be attributable

A baby and a bear
but for memory elsewhere

Aligned or not with my interests
decisions that can be attributable

All that I own messageable
but I own all that’s messageable
