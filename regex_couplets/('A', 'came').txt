('A', 'came')

Arrayed
I invited most of what came next

And as an extension of the values
I came back to me

As a clone, illegally conceived
I came after my past

COPY DREAM 
until the bill came

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
and came home to rewind inflections

All that I own messageable
and came home to rewind
