('A', 'child')

Arrayed
On a snow day with my children

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i

All of the time
especially in a child

Actually one day there is direction
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

And as an extension of the values
even my child

Articles all around stores in surfeit
Even the children

And need out in front purchase
my possession of my children

CONTRACT
speech my possession of my children

A baby and a bear
