('A', 'code')

Arrayed
as long as I have access to the code

Actually one day there is direction
May I have your zip code

A turtle fished out of the lake
I spend time online learning to code

And as an extension of the values
learned without too much difficulty to code

THE PLANNING PROCESS
Then I am learning to code

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
falling off the encoded end

All that I can think I want
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

And for an ungraspable time
Is the weight of my click or zipcode

SOCIAL
I click or my zipcode

As a clone, illegally conceived
zipcode

A baby and a bear
