('A', 'continue')

Arrayed
but it continued

And as an extension of the values
but it continued rippling muscle

As an extension of the values
no solid ground to continue along

All that I can think I want
I continue to presume

As a clone, illegally conceived
I continue to consume

COPY DREAM 
Then I continue to dream then

Articles all around us
I continued to dream then

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
