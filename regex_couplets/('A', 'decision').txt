('A', 'decision')

Arrayed
the planning process for decisions

Aspirational strategy
attributable decisions

As a clone, illegally conceived
forgetting decisions 

CONTRACT
decisioned to learn 

A baby and a bear
decisioned to learn back

Aligned or not with my interests
decisions that can be attributable

All that I own messageable
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
