('A', 'direction')

Arrayed
Whereas direction is beside the point

Arrayed out in such a nested way
into rotating directionless 

Ask who I am
Of course there is a direction

All of the time
One day there is direction

Actually one day there is direction
how can I know without direction

As though stationary and a destination
in rotating directionless space

And as an extension of the values
stopping off in all directions
