('A', 'do')

Arrayed
The dogs and lillies

Arrayed out in such a nested way
in a sharp downward turn 

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
In a sharp downard turn

All of the time
does not feel an exception

And as an extension of the values
to the down arrow

And make myself a visible
I brought my head down

A turtle fished out of the lake
I brought my qualities down

A person from a distance
which I brought down with qualities

After having been contented
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
What I do in my liesure

All that I can think I want
I walk up and don’t work anymore

A defeated
So I work and don’t look any

COPY DREAM 
here is the site of the battle of maldon

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
around the dogs and lillies

And from a weak distance
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

And for an ungraspable time
One was up where it should be down

As a clone, illegally conceived
and it doesn’t take long

CONTRACT
latency which doesn’t mean anything

PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
I only think I don’t listen

All that I own messageable
