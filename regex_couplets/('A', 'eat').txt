('A', 'eat')

Arrayed
too sunny to eat ice cream

All of the time
But I can’t let myself treat 

And as an extension of the values
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

BREAK
Then I can’t presume to treat others

And make myself a visible
executive breath

After having been contented
was not just a defeat

Attributable or
Where I put it beating

A person from a distance
execute breath

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
of the habits I create

Aspirational strategy
of the habits they create

ASPIRATING VISIONS
of the habits they create.

As an extension of the values
That company creates a life

All that I can think I want
it was not just a defeat

A defeated
And from that great distance

COPY DREAM 
And from a great distance

And for an ungraspable time
for the creation of the universe

CONTRACT
burrowed about from repeated travels

Aligned or not with my interests
