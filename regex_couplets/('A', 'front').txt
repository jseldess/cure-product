('A', 'front')

Arrayed
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Actually one day there is direction
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

A person from a distance
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
in front of the set afternoon

Aspirational strategy
in front of the set of regulations

ASPIRATING VISIONS
And need out in front purchase

Articles all around us
And read out in front

And we had to say goodbye to her there
behind or out front or up above
