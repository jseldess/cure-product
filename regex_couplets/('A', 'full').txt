('A', 'full')

Arrayed
It keeps coming down thankfully

All of the time
I am full of potential

And as an extension of the values
with full potential to movement

As an extension of the values
full of aspirations

All that I can think I want
full of the missing words

As a clone, illegally conceived
still carefully

PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
