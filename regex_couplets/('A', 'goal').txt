('A', 'goal')

Arrayed
Though there are quarters goals

Actually one day there is direction
We can wrestle them with their goals

And as an extension of the values
before morning goals

After having been contented
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
Strategy comes before goals

GOALS
not goals

Aspirational strategy
Not goals or tactics

ASPIRATING VISIONS
What would I feel without that goal

All that I can think I want
