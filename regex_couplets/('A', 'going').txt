('A', 'going')

Arrayed
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

All that I can think I want
The way that she is going

A way formerly like this one
The way that I am going

PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)
The way that I was going

A baby and a bear
way I was going 

A way I was going
