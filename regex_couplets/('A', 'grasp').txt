('A', 'grasp')

Arrayed
having been graspable

As a clone, illegally conceived
having been an ungraspable time

COPY DREAM 
Under the grasp principle

Articles all around us
for an ungraspable purchase

Articles all around stores in surfeit
For an ungraspable time

And need out in front purchase
And for an ungraspable time

And reached up the screen
