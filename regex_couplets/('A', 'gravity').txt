('A', 'gravity')

Arrayed
and testing the edge and gravity

Aspirational strategy
where I need gravity

And for an ungraspable time
Where I lead gravity

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I tell you where I need gravity

SOCIAL
that nothing had gravity

As a clone, illegally conceived
