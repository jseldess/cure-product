('A', 'he')

Arrayed
But that is beside the point

Ask who I am to suspend
Where I sleep at times

Arrayed out in such a nested way
Whereas direction is beside the point

Ask who I am
The dogs and lillies

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

PREFACE
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

All of the time
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Actually one day there is direction
Though there are quarters goals 

As though stationary and a destination
The edge isn’t even there

And put in place as though stationary
I step off the edge

And as an extension of the values
The South Carolina primary 

BREAK
here described

And make myself a visible
higher up in the internet

After having been contented
Then the sun isn’t available

ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’
the latter

Attributable or
 and time in the train

A turtle fished out of the lake
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

A person from a distance
The CEO tells me to embody values

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
Then I cannot see face value

THE PLANNING PROCESS
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
out in the snow

GOALS
It’s the third letter from the end

ASPIRATING
What the next step

Aspirational strategy
I can see only the back of falling values

ASPIRATING VISIONS
The planning process is for visionaries only

As an extension of the values
that potential is there for you

All that I can think I want
On the other hand

A defeated
advancing the time

COPY DREAM 
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

As a clone, illegally conceived
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Under the last seen principle

Articles all around us
Under the last principle of purchasing power

And we had to say goodbye to her there
she lay under the grass

Articles all around stores in surfeit
under the grasp principle

Articles all around storming around
We had to say goodbye there

And need out in front purchase
Under the last principle

And read out in front
Even the children

And from a weak distance
where I need gravity

And for an ungraspable time
they can be waived

And reached up the screen
there wasn’t any television 

And from that great distance
around the dogs and lillies

And from a great distance
While we’re up in the sky

SOCIAL
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

And we could inhabit the room easy
Or alter of course the time anyway

More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

A baby and a bear
Though we are waiting for her

A way formerly like this one
The constituents would be helped

All parties would be held for my own purchases
all parties would be held

CONTRACT
Where in me did I host

PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
To the ends of transactions

PRELUDE (IN A MINOR WITH A RUBBY DUCKY)
the way was water

PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)
But my not feeling the memory inside

PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR
the way that I was going

A way I was going
to the other end of actions

Aligned or not with my interests
battery dawn nights blending themselves

3 [PASSWORDS]
I have them lost

2 – PREAMBLE
buy in the sound privacy

All that I own messageable
traffick is there nonetheless
