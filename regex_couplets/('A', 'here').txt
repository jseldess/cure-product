('A', 'here')

Arrayed
Where I sleep at times

Ask who I am to suspend
Whereas direction is beside the point

Arrayed out in such a nested way
The prospects there already

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Of course there is a direction

All of the time
One day there is direction

Actually one day there is direction
Though there are quarters goals 

As though stationary and a destination
The edge isn’t even there

And put in place as though stationary
there are quarters 

And as an extension of the values
here described

And make myself a visible
I’ll get there eventually

After having been contented
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

BREAK
Where official policy is to catch and release

A turtle fished out of the lake
Where I put it beating

A person from a distance
I’ll get there ruins

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
there was no promotion

As an extension of the values
that potential is there for you

All that I can think I want
there was no television to hear

A defeated
but where is it

COPY DREAM 
in traversing get through there

As a clone, illegally conceived
here is the site of the battle of maldon

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
And we had to say goodbye to her there

Articles all around stores in surfeit
We had to say goodbye there

Articles all around us
We had to buy there

And need out in front purchase
 of those gathered

And from a weak distance
where I need gravity

And for an ungraspable time
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

And reached up the screen
there wasn’t any television 

And from that great distance
Where I lead gravity

And from a great distance
There are spots waiting

SOCIAL
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

And we could inhabit the room easy
Where in me did I host

elsewhere my purposes

A baby and a bear
where I send and relive would be held

All parties would be held for my own purchases
where I send and relive aside

All parties would be held
Elsewhere my memory

CONTRACT
Elsewhere by my memory

PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
Is there a baby and a bear

PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR
There are constant ways

A way I was going
where rights ended themselves

Aligned or not with my interests
By my memory elsewhere

3 [PASSWORDS]
where the tongue rippled

2 – PREAMBLE
The offers there already

All that I own messageable
traffick is there nonetheless
