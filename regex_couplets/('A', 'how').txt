('A', 'how')

Arrayed
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
how can I know without direction

As though stationary and a destination
Though how can you know without direction

And as an extension of the values
who knows how to turn it off
