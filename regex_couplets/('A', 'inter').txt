('A', 'inter')

Arrayed
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

PREFACE
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

All of the time
interjecting on a day ambition

Actually one day there is direction
way high up in the inter

And make myself a visible
higher up in the internet

After having been contented
hold at intervals riding forward

And as an extension of the values
high up in the internet

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
with internally regulated climate

Aspirational strategy
Then I saw them interview

COPY DREAM 
my interfaced stand data

Aligned or not with my interests
I interfaced
