('A', 'keep')

Arrayed
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
It keeps coming down thankfully

All of the time
I keep turning back again myself

A turtle fished out of the lake
I keep turning back

And as an extension of the values
