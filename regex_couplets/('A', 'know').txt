('A', 'know')

Arrayed
who knows the way

All of the time
how can I know without direction

As though stationary and a destination
Though how can you know without direction

And as an extension of the values
I even know what I would find

All that I can think I want
even when close to my knowing

COPY DREAM 
When closed to my knowing

As a clone, illegally conceived
knowing the constituents

CONTRACT
who knows how to turn it off

PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)
who know the ways to their other end

PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR
that their knowing

2 â€“ PREAMBLE
