('A', 'learn')

Arrayed
in light of learning what we see

All of the time
I spend time online learning to code

And as an extension of the values
learned without too much difficulty to code

THE PLANNING PROCESS
Then I am learning to code

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
decisioned to learn 

CONTRACT
decisioned to learn back

A baby and a bear
phase decision for learning

Aligned or not with my interests
I learned my location

3 [PASSWORDS]
for learning by the prospect

All that I own messageable
