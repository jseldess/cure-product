('A', 'literal')

Arrayed
and literally moved

And we could inhabit the room easy
as it was designed literally

All parties would be held for my own purchases
and literally unproved

All parties would be held
literally unproved 

CONTRACT
and literally moved about

PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
not literally moved about

Aligned or not with my interests
not literally moved
