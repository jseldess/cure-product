('A', 'man')

Arrayed
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
They have very many choices

More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

The many transparent pixel calls

PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR
