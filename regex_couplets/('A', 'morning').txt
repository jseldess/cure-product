('A', 'morning')

Arrayed
We’ll have coffee this morning

Arrayed out in such a nested way
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
When I woke up in the morning

All of the time
before morning goals

After having been contented
Strategy comes before morning

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
It’s morning 

GOALS
