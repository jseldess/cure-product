('A', 'nights')

Arrayed
battery dawn nights blending themselves

All of the time
dawn already formerly nights 

And we could inhabit the room easy
with dawn already formerly nights 

CONTRACT
battery dawn nights 

PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

A way I was going
battery dawn nights ending themselves

Aligned or not with my interests
