('A', 'now')

Arrayed
On a snow day with my children

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
who knows the way

All of the time
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

Actually one day there is direction
how can I know without direction

As though stationary and a destination
Though how can you know without direction

And as an extension of the values
Right now I’m the cart

And make myself a visible
out in the snow

After having been contented
out in the snow fall

Aspirational strategy
out in the snow falling face value

ASPIRATING VISIONS
I take it out in the snow fall

All that I can think I want
even when close to my knowing

COPY DREAM 
When closed to my knowing

As a clone, illegally conceived
knowing the constituents

CONTRACT
who knows how to turn it off

PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)
who know the ways to their other end

PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR
that their knowing

2 – PREAMBLE
