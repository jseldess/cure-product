('A', 'open')

Arrayed
Before we walk across the wide opening

All of the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

Actually one day there is direction
my desires were open

A person from a distance
I wish my desires were open

And as an extension of the values
The simple act opening surmounted

A defeated
