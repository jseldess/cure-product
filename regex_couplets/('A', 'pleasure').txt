('A', 'pleasure')

Arrayed
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Which is a pleasure to never live out

BREAK
there was no walking along the pleasure

All that I can think I want
up in the television pleasure

A defeated
