('A', 'product')

Arrayed
an impure product

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
What is an impure product

All of the time
as a cure product

And as an extension of the values
as a pure product

BREAK
as an impure product

And make myself a visible
the least productive of myself

Aligned or not with my interests
