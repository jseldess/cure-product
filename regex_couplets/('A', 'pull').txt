('A', 'pull')

Arrayed
I’ll pull myself another personality type

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

And as an extension of the values
I’ll pull my data higher up

And make myself a visible
I’ll pull my data

After having been contented
fish pulled out of the lake

A person from a distance
I’ll pull myself higher up

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
