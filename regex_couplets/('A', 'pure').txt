('A', 'pure')

Arrayed
an impure product

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

All of the time
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

And as an extension of the values
as a pure product

BREAK
as an impure product

And make myself a visible
