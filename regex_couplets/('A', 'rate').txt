('A', 'rate')

Arrayed
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
and my heart rate

A turtle fished out of the lake
and my heartrate

A person from a distance
Strategy comes before morning

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
Strategy comes before goals

GOALS
and strategies not tactics

Aspirational strategy
I aspirate with little vision

And as an extension of the values
