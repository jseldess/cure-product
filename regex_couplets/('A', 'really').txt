('A', 'really')

Arrayed
because it was really dark

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
it was really sunny

All of the time
When they really take hold of my finger

And as an extension of the values
without really agreeing

And we could inhabit the room easy
without really speaking

All parties would be held for my own purchases
without really breaking

CONTRACT
without really needing

PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
also didnâ€™t really move

Aligned or not with my interests
