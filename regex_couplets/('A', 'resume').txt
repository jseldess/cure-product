('A', 'resume')

Arrayed
So I presume the offers already

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
and can’t presume to need

And as an extension of the values
Then I can’t presume to need others

And make myself a visible
I resume unassimilable visions

All that I can think I want
I resume indelible tracks

A defeated
I resume attributable visions

COPY DREAM 
I continue to presume

As a clone, illegally conceived
I presume to others

CONTRACT
I presume the offers

All that I own messageable
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
