('A', 'sleep.')

Arrayed
Where I sleep at times

Ask who I am to suspend
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
That’s where I sleep at times

And make myself a visible
Interrupted sleep or

A turtle fished out of the lake
While I should be sleeping 

And as an extension of the values
like flattening sleep 

COPY DREAM
