Arrayed
I’ll pull myself another personality type

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
When I want something

All of the time
You can hear it also through your leisure

And as an extension of the values
soft paper

And make myself a visible
reasons resources

BREAK
I want to cite a poem so usual

ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’
solvents

Attributable or
A person from a distance

After having been contented
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

As an extension of the values
embodied with little reason

All that I can think I want
If I take some different measure

A defeated
Toward the start informally given my reasons

COPY DREAM 
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

And reached up the screen
so that nothing had gravity

As a clone, illegally conceived
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

And we could inhabit the room easy
More reasons around my country

sound inundated for my own purchases

All parties would be held for my own purchases
and sound redundant

All parties would be held
firing and connecting somewhere

CONTRACT
so still watch them

PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
by in the sound privacy

A baby and a bear
by in the sounded privacy

Aligned or not with my interests
buy in the sound privacy

All that I own messageable
and could be inflected with reasons
