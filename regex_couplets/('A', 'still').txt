('A', 'still')

Arrayed
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
That is itself not still

As though stationary and a destination
wrestling to stay still

And as an extension of the values
I love my daughter still

All that I can think I want
though we are still breaking in

A baby and a bear
still wash conserving

PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
