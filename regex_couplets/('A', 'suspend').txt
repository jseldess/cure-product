('A', 'suspend')

Arrayed
Ask who I am to suspend

Arrayed out in such a nested way
I am to end my connections suspended live

Ask who I am
I suspend live connections to you

Ask who I am to end my live connection
I suspend my connections to you

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
I wear suspenders

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
suspenders

And from a weak distance
