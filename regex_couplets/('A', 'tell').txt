('A', 'tell')

Arrayed
Then I constellate my time family country

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
So I constellate the time family country

And make myself a visible
I constellate the time

BREAK
The CEO tells me to embody values

And as an extension of the values
I had to tell them the news

As an extension of the values
I tell you my purposes

And for an ungraspable time
I tell you the weight of my purchases

And reached up the screen
I tell you the weight of my purposes

SOCIAL
I tell you where I need gravity

As a clone, illegally conceived
and that man comes on to tell me 

CONTRACT
