('A', 'time.')

Arrayed
Where I sleep at times

Ask who I am to suspend
Then I constellate my time family country

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
only fragments of time with my children

Actually one day there is direction
at any time it can drift again

And as an extension of the values
That’s where I sleep at times

And make myself a visible
on the time line I was on

After having been contented
So I constellate the time family country

BREAK
 and time in the train

A turtle fished out of the lake
I spend time online learning to code

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
over the long time I was on

THE PLANNING PROCESS
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

GOALS
The long time I had a vision

All that I can think I want
without the long time I was accounting

A defeated
The long time I was a vision

COPY DREAM 
or alter of course the time anyway

And we could inhabit the room easy
formerly a long time they were on

More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds
until a happier time found

CONTRACT
formerly along time they were on

A baby and a bear
time they were on

Aligned or not with my interests
in the long time they were on
