('A', 'turn')

Arrayed
in a sharp downward turn 

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
In a sharp downard turn

All of the time
sudden downward turn

And make myself a visible
I keep turning back again myself

A turtle fished out of the lake
I keep turning back

And as an extension of the values
who knows how to turn it off

PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)
Bach helps turn it off

PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR
I have turned it off

A way I was going
I turn not sad exactly

Aligned or not with my interests
I return not sad exactly
