('A', 'under')

Arrayed
under pillowing a cloud

COPY DREAM 
under the last seen principle

As a clone, illegally conceived
she lay under the grass

Articles all around stores in surfeit
under the grasp principle

Articles all around us
designed to hold up my underwear

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
