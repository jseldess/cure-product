('A', 'up?')

Arrayed
Ask who I am to suspend

Arrayed out in such a nested way
But that is beside the point

Ask who I am
I suspend live connections to you

Ask who I am to end my live connection
Suspended live in connections to you

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

PREFACE
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

All of the time
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Actually one day there is direction
Though there are quarters goals 

As though stationary and a destination
And put in place as though stationary

And as an extension of the values
The South Carolina primary 

BREAK
But in more 

And make myself a visible
and invaluable partner

After having been contented
Then the sun isn’t available

ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’
Then I cannot see face value

Attributable or
Interrupted sleep or

A turtle fished out of the lake
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

A person from a distance
The CEO tells me to embody values

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

THE PLANNING PROCESS
The ventillation rushes on

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
out in the snow

GOALS
I just got a letter

ASPIRATING
of my economic value

Aspirational strategy
I can see only the back of falling values

ASPIRATING VISIONS
I hear it between bills and stuff

As an extension of the values
that potential is there for you

All that I can think I want
not many face up

A defeated
around my country 

COPY DREAM 
I captured an afterimage

As a clone, illegally conceived
black spots on a white surface

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

Articles all around us
Having been purchased out of you

And we had to say goodbye to her there
she lay under the grass

Articles all around stores in surfeit
storing in surfeit

Articles all around storming around
abundance

And need out in front purchase
For an ungraspable time

And read out in front
Until my purpose 

And from a weak distance
I tell you my purposes

And for an ungraspable time
I have supporters

And reached up the screen
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

And from that great distance
around the dogs and lillies

And from a great distance
While we’re up in the sky

SOCIAL
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

And we could inhabit the room easy
Or alter of course the time anyway

More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

A baby and a bear
Though we are waiting for her

A way formerly like this one
The constituents would be helped

All parties would be held for my own purchases
and found inundated

All parties would be held
For my own purchases

CONTRACT
in the form filled offered in trust

PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
I end up in Bach 

PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)
But my not feeling the memory inside

PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR
I have turned it off

A way I was going
to the other end of my purpose

Aligned or not with my interests
which I feel formerly about for

3 [PASSWORDS]
I have them trust in me

2 – PREAMBLE
buy in the sound privacy

All that I own messageable
but I own all that’s messageable
