('A', 'us')

Arrayed
Ask who I am to suspend

Arrayed out in such a nested way
I am to end my connections suspended live

Ask who I am
I suspend live connections to you

Ask who I am to end my live connection
Suspended live in connections to you

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Because it was really dark

All of the time
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Actually one day there is direction
russling to stay still

And as an extension of the values
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

BREAK
I want to cite a poem so usual

ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’
was not just a defeat

Attributable or
In a vertiginous dream

A turtle fished out of the lake
in a continuous vertiginous dream

A person from a distance
You use the most essential parts

And make myself a visible
The ventillation rushes on

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
I just got a letter

ASPIRATING
So stay with us

As an extension of the values
but it continued rippling muscle

All that I can think I want
it was not just a defeat

A defeated
I have them trust in me

COPY DREAM 
a futile joyous white sun

As a clone, illegally conceived
Articles all around us

And we had to say goodbye to her there
I wear suspenders

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I used my technology

And from a weak distance
suspenders

And for an ungraspable time
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

And we could inhabit the room easy
in the form filled offered in trust

A baby and a bear
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

All parties would be held
useless for not having paid

CONTRACT
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
radiating from housing

Aligned or not with my interests
