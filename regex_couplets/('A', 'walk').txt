('A', 'walk')

Arrayed
Before we walk across the wide field

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Before we walk across the wide opening

All of the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

Actually one day there is direction
there was no walking along the pleasure

All that I can think I want
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

A defeated
walking into percents blending themselves

COPY DREAM
