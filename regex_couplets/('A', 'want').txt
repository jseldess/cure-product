('A', 'want')

Arrayed
When I want something

All of the time
I want to find a way to block it incoming

Actually one day there is direction
I want but not to impart cynicism

And as an extension of the values
I want to cite a poem so usual

ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’
I want to cite a poem

BREAK
all that I can think I want

A defeated
