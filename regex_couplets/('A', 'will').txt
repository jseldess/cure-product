('A', 'will')

Arrayed
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

Actually one day there is direction
will not be the same

All that I can think I want
that will spur me on

COPY DREAM 
would only willingly break

CONTRACT
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
my daughter will learn 

A baby and a bear
