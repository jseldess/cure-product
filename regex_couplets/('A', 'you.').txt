('A', 'you.')

Arrayed
Though how can you know without direction

And as an extension of the values
You can hear it also through your leisure

And make myself a visible
if you have providence to excess

BREAK
If you have confidence regardless all else

Attributable or
May I have your zip code

A turtle fished out of the lake
That you can see only the back of

Aspirational strategy
your bid to the next highest ranked network

ASPIRATING VISIONS
since you can imagine movement

As an extension of the values
where you can earn more 

All that I can think I want
you need history

COPY DREAM 
a futile joyous white sun

As a clone, illegally conceived
I tell you my purposes

And for an ungraspable time
I tell you the weight of my purchases

And reached up the screen
I tell you the weight of my purposes

SOCIAL
I tell you where I need gravity

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

And we could inhabit the room easy
This is your voice
