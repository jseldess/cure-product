('And', 'For')

And put in place as though stationary
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

And as an extension of the values
Forecasting the story before dawn

And make myself a visible
For an ungraspable time

And need out in front purchase
For an ungraspable purchase

And we had to say goodbye to her there
For Mitt Romney
