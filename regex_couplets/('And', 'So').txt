('And', 'so')

And put in place as though stationary
You can hear it also through your leisure

And as an extension of the values
soft paper

And make myself a visible
reasons resources

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

And reached up the screen
so that nothing had gravity

And we could inhabit the room easy
I want to cite a poem so usual
