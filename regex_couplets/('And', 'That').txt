('And', 'That')

And put in place as though stationary
That’s where I sleep at times

And make myself a visible
That’s when they really take

And as an extension of the values
That you can see only the back of

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
That I captured an afterimage

And we could inhabit the room easy
That are my right to say
