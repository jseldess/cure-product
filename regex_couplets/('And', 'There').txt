('And', 'There')

And put in place as though stationary
There are quarterly goals

And as an extension of the values
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

And make myself a visible
There was very little physical activity

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
There are spots waiting

And from a great distance
There are constant ways
