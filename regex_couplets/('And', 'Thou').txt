('And', 'Thou')

And put in place as though stationary
Though there are quarters goals

And as an extension of the values
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Though we are waiting for her

And we could inhabit the room easy
Though we are breaking
