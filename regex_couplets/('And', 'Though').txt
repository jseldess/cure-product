('And', 'though')

And put in place as though stationary
though there are quarters with goals

And as an extension of the values
though it was most emphatically that

And make myself a visible
I had nightmares though

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I thought

And we could inhabit the room easy
though we are still breaking in
