('And', 'Where')

And put in place as though stationary
Where official policy is to catch and release

And as an extension of the values
Where I take my liesure

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Where I lead gravity

And from a weak distance
Where I need gravity

And for an ungraspable time
Where in me did I host

And we could inhabit the room easy
Where I host my purposes
