('And', 'around')

And put in place as though stationary
Spinning around the heart

And as an extension of the values
around my country 

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Articles all around us

And we had to say goodbye to her there
articles all around storming around

And need out in front purchase
around the dogs and lillies

And from a weak distance
I spin around

And for an ungraspable time
around 

And from that great distance
I spun around trying to touch the spots

And from a great distance
More reasons around my country
