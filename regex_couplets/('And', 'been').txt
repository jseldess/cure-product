('And', 'been')

And put in place as though stationary
It has been since

And make myself a visible
After having been contented

And as an extension of the values
that having been after content

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
having been an ungraspable time

And we had to say goodbye to her there
Having been purchased out of you

And from a weak distance
