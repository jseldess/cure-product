('And', 'came')

And put in place as though stationary
I invited most of what came next

And as an extension of the values
I came back to me

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I came after my past

And we had to say goodbye to her there
until the bill came

And we could inhabit the room easy
and came home to rewind inflections
