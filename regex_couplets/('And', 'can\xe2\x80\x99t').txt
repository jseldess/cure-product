('And', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

And put in place as though stationary
I can’t fix them without direction

And as an extension of the values
Then I can’t presume to need others

And make myself a visible
That can’t be glimpsed

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Though we can’t help waiting
