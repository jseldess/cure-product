('And', 'continue')

And put in place as though stationary
but it continued

And as an extension of the values
but it continued rippling muscle

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I continue to consume

And we had to say goodbye to her there
Then I continue to dream then

And from a weak distance
I continued to dream then

And we could inhabit the room easy
