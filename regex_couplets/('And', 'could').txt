('And', 'could')

And put in place as though stationary
and could be mapped and weighed

And as an extension of the values
until I could not tire 

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I could consume the dream

And we had to say goodbye to her there
I could in effect credit

And from a weak distance
and we could inhabit the room easy
