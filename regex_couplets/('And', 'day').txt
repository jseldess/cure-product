('And', 'day')

And put in place as though stationary
I argued the days felt longer

And as an extension of the values
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
The day

And we could inhabit the room easy
I have a memory between the day
