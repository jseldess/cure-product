('And', 'distance')

And put in place as though stationary
Falling from this distance

And as an extension of the values
A person from a distance

And make myself a visible
And from a weak distance

And for an ungraspable time
And from that great distance

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
And from a great distance

And we could inhabit the room easy
