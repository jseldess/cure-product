('And', 'down')

And put in place as though stationary
in a sharp downward turn 

And as an extension of the values
to the down arrow

And make myself a visible
I brought my head down

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

And for an ungraspable time
One was up where it should be down

And we could inhabit the room easy
