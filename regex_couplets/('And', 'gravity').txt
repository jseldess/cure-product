('And', 'gravity')

And put in place as though stationary
and testing the edge and gravity

And as an extension of the values
where I need gravity

And for an ungraspable time
Where I lead gravity

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I tell you where I need gravity

And we could inhabit the room easy
