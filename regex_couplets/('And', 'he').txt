('And', 'he')

And put in place as though stationary
I step off the edge

And as an extension of the values
The South Carolina primary 

And make myself a visible
higher up in the internet

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

And we had to say goodbye to her there
she lay under the grass

And need out in front purchase
Under the last principle

And read out in front
Even the children

And from a weak distance
where I need gravity

And for an ungraspable time
they can be waived

And reached up the screen
there wasn’t any television 

And from that great distance
around the dogs and lillies

And from a great distance
While we’re up in the sky

And we could inhabit the room easy
Or alter of course the time anyway
