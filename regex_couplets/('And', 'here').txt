('And', 'here')

And put in place as though stationary
Though there are quarters goals

And as an extension of the values
here described

And make myself a visible
I’ll get there eventually

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
And we had to say goodbye to her there

And need out in front purchase
We had to say goodbye there

And read out in front
 of those gathered

And from a weak distance
where I need gravity

And for an ungraspable time
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

And reached up the screen
there wasn’t any television 

And from that great distance
Where I lead gravity

And from a great distance
There are spots waiting

And we could inhabit the room easy
Where in me did I host
