('And', 'hold')

And put in place as though stationary
I take hold of my finger

And as an extension of the values
Since I had to hold the entire company

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
and hold and wish to hold

And we had to say goodbye to her there
designed to hold up my underwear

And from a weak distance
