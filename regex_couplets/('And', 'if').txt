('And', 'if')

And put in place as though stationary
drifting does not feel an exception

And as an extension of the values
drifting away needs others presume desires

And make myself a visible
if you have providence to excess

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
if there is anything 

And we could inhabit the room easy
if you have providence
