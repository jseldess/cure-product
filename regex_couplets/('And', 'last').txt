('And', 'last')

And put in place as though stationary
What was the last time

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Under the last seen principle

And we had to say goodbye to her there
Under the last principle

And need out in front purchase
Under the last principle of purchasing power

And from a weak distance
Where in me did I last
