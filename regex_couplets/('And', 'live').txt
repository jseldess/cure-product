('And', 'live')

And put in place as though stationary
Which is a measure to never live out

And as an extension of the values
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

And make myself a visible
Which is a pleasure to never live out

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
where I send and relive aside
