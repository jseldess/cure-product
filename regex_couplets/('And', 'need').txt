('And', 'need')

And put in place as though stationary
and can’t presume to need

And as an extension of the values
Then I can’t presume to need others

And make myself a visible
I need the work

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
And need out in front purchase

And read out in front
where I need gravity

And for an ungraspable time
I tell you where I need gravity

And we could inhabit the room easy
not needing to wait
