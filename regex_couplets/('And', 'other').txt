('And', 'other')

And put in place as though stationary
others desires

And as an extension of the values
Then I can’t presume to need others

And make myself a visible
I’ll pull myself another personality type

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

And we could inhabit the room easy
and other types of tracking technology
