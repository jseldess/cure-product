('And', 'over')

And put in place as though stationary
I step over the edge

And as an extension of the values
over the long time up in the sky

And make myself a visible
over the time line I was on

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

And we could inhabit the room easy
over the roof of the buildings across the alley
