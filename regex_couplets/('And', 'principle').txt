('And', 'principle')

And put in place as though stationary
under the last seen principle

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Under the grass principle

And we had to say goodbye to her there
under the grasp principle

And need out in front purchase
Under the last principle

And read out in front
Under the last principle of purchasing power

And from a weak distance
