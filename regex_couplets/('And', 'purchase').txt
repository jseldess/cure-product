('And', 'purchase')

And put in place as though stationary
in traversing my purchase

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
purchased out

And we had to say goodbye to her there
for an ungraspable purchase

And need out in front purchase
Having been purchased out of you

And from a weak distance
I tell you the weight of my purchases

And reached up the screen
until I purchase up the sky

And from that great distance
until I purchase the sky

And from a great distance
Is the weight of my purchases

And for an ungraspable time
I have entered my purchases
