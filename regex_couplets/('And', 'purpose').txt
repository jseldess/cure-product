('And', 'purpose')

And put in place as though stationary
by no ventillation my purpose

And as an extension of the values
until my purpose up in the sky

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
My purpose up in the sky

And need out in front purchase
Until my purpose 

And we had to say goodbye to her there
I tell you my purposes

And for an ungraspable time
until I purpose up in the sky

And reached up the screen
I tell you the weight of my purposes

And we could inhabit the room easy
Where I host my purposes
