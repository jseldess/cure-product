('And', 'sky')

And put in place as though stationary
over the long time up in the sky

And as an extension of the values
over the long line up in the sky

And make myself a visible
until my purpose up in the sky

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Up in the sky

And need out in front purchase
My purpose up in the sky

And we had to say goodbye to her there
While they’re up in the sky

And reached up the screen
until I purchase up the sky

And from that great distance
While we’re up in the sky

And from a great distance
