('And', 'tell')

And put in place as though stationary
Then I constellate my time family country

And as an extension of the values
So I constellate the time family country

And make myself a visible
I constellate the time

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I tell you my purposes

And for an ungraspable time
I tell you the weight of my purchases

And reached up the screen
I tell you the weight of my purposes

And we could inhabit the room easy
and that man comes on to tell me
