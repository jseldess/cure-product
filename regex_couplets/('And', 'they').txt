('And', 'They')

And put in place as though stationary
Theyâ€™re just not mine

And as an extension of the values
They are called aspirational

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
They can be waived

And for an ungraspable time
They can be weighed

And we could inhabit the room easy
They have very many choices
