('And', 'time.')

And put in place as though stationary
where I sleep at times

And as an extension of the values
at any time it can drift again

And make myself a visible
on the time line I was on

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
or alter of course the time anyway

And we could inhabit the room easy
formerly a long time they were on
