('And', 'until')

And put in place as though stationary
until my purpose up in the sky

And as an extension of the values
until I could not tire 

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
until I purpose up in the sky

And reached up the screen
until I purchase up the sky

And from that great distance
until I purchase the sky

And from a great distance
until the bill came

And we could inhabit the room easy
until a happier time found
