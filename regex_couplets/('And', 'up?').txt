('And', 'up?')

And put in place as though stationary
Though there are quarters goals

And as an extension of the values
The South Carolina primary 

And make myself a visible
and invaluable partner

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

And we had to say goodbye to her there
she lay under the grass

And need out in front purchase
For an ungraspable time

And read out in front
Until my purpose 

And from a weak distance
I tell you my purposes

And for an ungraspable time
I have supporters

And reached up the screen
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

And from that great distance
around the dogs and lillies

And from a great distance
While we’re up in the sky

And we could inhabit the room easy
Or alter of course the time anyway
