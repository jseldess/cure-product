('And', 'vision')

And put in place as though stationary
I had me a vision

And as an extension of the values
The planning process for visions

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
there wasnâ€™t any television 

And from a weak distance
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

And we could inhabit the room easy
joined in my television
