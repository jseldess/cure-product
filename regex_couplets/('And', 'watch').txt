('And', 'watch')

And put in place as though stationary
when watching tv

And as an extension of the values
in the sense of watching

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I watch a movie

And we had to say goodbye to her there
I watch a moving afterimage

And from a weak distance
When I'm watching my tv
