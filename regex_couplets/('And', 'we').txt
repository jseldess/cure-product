('And', 'We')

And put in place as though stationary
We can wrestle them with their goals

And as an extension of the values
We had to say goodbye there

And need out in front purchase
We had to buy there

And read out in front
We had inhabited actually

And we could inhabit the room easy
We got paid one way by a voice
