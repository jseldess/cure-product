('And', 'weight')

And put in place as though stationary
I tell you the weight of my purchases

And reached up the screen
I tell you the weight of my purposes

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
weight of my purposes

And we could inhabit the room easy
The weight kept moaned impression
