('And', 'were')

And put in place as though stationary
When we had jobs that were to earn

And as an extension of the values
I argued the days were longer

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

And we could inhabit the room easy
formerly a long time they were on
