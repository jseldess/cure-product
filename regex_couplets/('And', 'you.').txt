('And', 'you.')

And put in place as though stationary
Though how can you know without direction

And as an extension of the values
You can hear it also through your leisure

And make myself a visible
if you have providence to excess

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I tell you my purposes

And for an ungraspable time
I tell you the weight of my purchases

And reached up the screen
I tell you the weight of my purposes

And we could inhabit the room easy
This is your voice
