('As', 'earn')

Ask who I am to suspend
in light of learning what we see

As though stationary and a destination
When we had jobs that were to earn

Assimilable or
I spend time online learning to code

Aspirational strategy
where you can earn more 

As a clone, illegally conceived
decisioned to learn
