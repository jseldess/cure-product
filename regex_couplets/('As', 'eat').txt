('As', 'eat')

Ask who I am to suspend
too sunny to eat ice cream

As though stationary and a destination
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

Assimilable or
Where I put it beating

Aspirational strategy
of the habits they create

As an extension of the values
That company creates a life

As a clone, illegally conceived
And from that great distance
