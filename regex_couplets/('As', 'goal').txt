('As', 'goal')

Ask who I am to suspend
Though there are quarters goals

As though stationary and a destination
We can wrestle them with their goals

Assimilable or
before morning goals

Aspirational strategy
Not goals or tactics

As an extension of the values
What would I feel without that goal

As a clone, illegally conceived
