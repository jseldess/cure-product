('As', 'inter')

Ask who I am to suspend
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

As though stationary and a destination
way high up in the inter

Assimilable or
hold at intervals riding forward

Aspirational strategy
with internally regulated climate

As an extension of the values
Then I saw them interview

As a clone, illegally conceived
my interfaced stand data
