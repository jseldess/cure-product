('As', 'now')

Ask who I am to suspend
On a snow day with my children

As though stationary and a destination
Though how can you know without direction

Assimilable or
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

Aspirational strategy
out in the snow fall

As an extension of the values
I take it out in the snow fall

As a clone, illegally conceived
knowing the constituents
