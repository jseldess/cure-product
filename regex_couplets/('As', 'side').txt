('As', 'side')

Ask who I am to suspend
But that is beside the point

Ask who I am
Whereas direction is beside the point

As though stationary and a destination
aside from the retinas

As an extension of the values
actually considering the end

As a clone, illegally conceived
But my not feeling the memory aside
