('As', 'time.')

Ask who I am to suspend
Where I sleep at times

Ask who I am
Then I constellate my time family country

As though stationary and a destination
at any time it can drift again

Assimilable or
 and time in the train

Aspirational strategy
The long time I had a vision

As a clone, illegally conceived
or alter of course the time anyway
