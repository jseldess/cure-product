('Bach', 'For')

I end up in Bach 
Formerly a way like this one

I end up Bach
Formerly away there are constant ways

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
Forty-one seconds in

I end up in Bach with no way 
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
