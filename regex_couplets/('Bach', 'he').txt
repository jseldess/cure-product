('Bach', 'he')

I end up in Bach 
the way was water

I end up in Bach and Selma
with her way

I end up Bach
to the ends of my transactions

Bach helps turn it off
Selma helps too

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
to the other end of actions

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
who knows the way

and end up in Bach
There are no constant ways

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
There are constant ways

I end up Bach forty-one seconds in
with constant ways to the other end

I end up in Bach with no way 
to the other end of transactions

on Bach
on the other end
