('Bach', 'here')

I end up in Bach 
Is there a baby and a bear

I end up Bach
There are constant ways

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
There are no constant waves

and end up in Bach
There are no constant ways

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
Formerly away there are constant ways

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
where rights ended themselves
