('Bach', 'up?')

I end up in Bach 
with my daughter

I end up in Bach and Selma
Though we are waiting for her

I end up Bach
who knows how to turn it off

Bach helps turn it off
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
The contours exchange with you

and end up in Bach
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

I end up Bach forty-one seconds in
But my not feeling the memory inside

I end up in Bach with no way 
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

on Bach
I stand and retrieve the impulse around
