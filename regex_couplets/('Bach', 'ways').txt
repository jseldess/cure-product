('Bach', 'ways')

I end up in Bach 
with constant ways 

I end up Bach
with her ways to the ends

Bach helps turn it off
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
with no constant ways 

and end up in Bach
There are no constant ways

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
There are constant ways

I end up Bach forty-one seconds in
with constant ways to the other end

I end up in Bach with no way 
deep into pathways from repeated travels
