('But', 'A')

But that is beside the point
Ask who I am to suspend

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

But I can’t let myself treat 
And as an extension of the values

But in more 
And make myself a visible

But not to me directly
After having been contented

But would I love her the same
All that I can think I want

But my not feeling the memory aside
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

But my not feeling the memory inside
CONTRACT

But my feeling the memory aside
Aligned or not with my interests
