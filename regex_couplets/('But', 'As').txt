('but', 'As')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
As though stationary and a destination

but not impart cynicism
Assimilable or

but the sun isn’t up
Aspirational strategy

but it continued
As an extension of the values

but it continued rippling muscle
As a clone, illegally conceived

that decisions can be attributable
