('but', 'For')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Attributable or
Forecasting the story before dawn

but the sun isn’t up
For an ungraspable time

that decisions can be attributable
Formerly a way like this one

but for memory elsewhere
For a while I think I don’t listen

but I own all that’s messageable
