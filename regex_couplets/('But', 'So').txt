('but', 'so')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

but not impart cynicism
You can hear it also through your leisure

Attributable or
A person from a distance

but the sun isn’t up
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

but it continued
My associations

but it continued rippling muscle
with little reason to aspiration

but would I love her the same
If I take some different measure

but they are black spots
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

but I can hear them
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I resume attributable visions
You can hear it also through static leisure

but where is it
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

that decisions can be attributable
by in the sound privacy

but for memory elsewhere
buy in the sound privacy

decisions that can be attributable
and could be inflected with reasons

revisions that can be attributable
