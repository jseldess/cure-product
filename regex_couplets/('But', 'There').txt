('But', 'There')

But that is beside the point
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

But I can’t let myself treat 
There are quarterly goals

But in more 
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

But not to me directly
There was very little physical activity

But would I love her the same
There are spots waiting

But my not feeling the memory aside
There are constant ways

But my not feeling the memory inside
There are no constant waves

But my feeling the memory aside
