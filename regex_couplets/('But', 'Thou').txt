('but', 'Thou')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
Though there are quarters goals

but not impart cynicism
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

but they are black spots
Though in not many acts

I resume attributable visions
Though we are waiting for her

that decisions can be attributable
Though we can’t help waiting

but for memory elsewhere
