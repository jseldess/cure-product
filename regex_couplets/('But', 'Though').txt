('But', 'though')

But that is beside the point
As though stationary and a destination

But I can’t let myself treat 
though it was most emphatically that

But not to me directly
I had nightmares though

But would I love her the same
though not many freeze up

But my not feeling the memory aside
I thought

But my not feeling the memory inside
after though there’s no memory

But my feeling the memory aside
I answered what I thought
