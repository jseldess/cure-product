('But', 'To')

But that is beside the point
To my children Walt Whitman

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
To my chidren

But not to impart cynicism
To my children

But in more 
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

But not to me directly
To that impossible place

But would I love her the same
Tomorrow

But my not feeling the memory aside
To the ends of transactions

But my not feeling the memory inside
To the ends of my transactions

But my feeling the memory aside
To the right of determined elections
