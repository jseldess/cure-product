('But', 'Where')

But that is beside the point
Where I sleep at times

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Where official policy is to catch and release

But not to me directly
Where I put it beating

But would I love her the same
Where I take my liesure

But my not feeling the memory aside
Where I host my purposes

But my not feeling the memory inside
Where in me did I host

But my feeling the memory aside
