('but', 'while')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
Looking back while I should be sleeping

but the sun isn’t up
while wrapped in static

I resume attributable visions
while wrapped in explicit static

attributable visions
while consuming damage

that decisions can be attributable
I answered while interfaced

but for memory elsewhere
for a while to listen already

revisions that can be attributable
For a while I think I don’t listen

but I own all that’s messageable
