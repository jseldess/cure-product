('But', 'You')

But that is beside the point
You should ask who I am

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
You can hear it also through your leisure

But I can’t let myself treat 
You use the most essential parts

But would I love her the same
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

But my not feeling the memory aside
You can have seen offering
