('But', 'about')

But that is beside the point
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
burrowed about from repeated travels

But my not feeling the memory aside
and literally moved about

But my not feeling the memory inside
I answered about

But my feeling the memory aside
which I feel formerly about for
