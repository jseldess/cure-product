('But', 'across')

But that is beside the point
Before we walk across the wide field

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Before we walk across the wide opening

But I can’t let myself treat 
across the retinas

But would I love her the same
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

But my not feeling the memory aside
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
