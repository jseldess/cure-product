('But', 'act')

But that is beside the point
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
I was enjoined to act again myself

But in more 
I was enjoined to act again

But would I love her the same
actually considering the end

But my not feeling the memory aside
The ends of my transactions

But my not feeling the memory inside
to the ends of my transactions

But my feeling the memory aside
I turn not sad exactly
