('But', 'along')

But that is beside the point
bring your child along

But in more 
The days lined along company

But would I love her the same
there was no walking along the pleasure

But my not feeling the memory aside
formerly along time they were on

But my not feeling the memory inside
formerly along my say to the elections

But my feeling the memory aside
along cables

But my not 
shone formerly along time
