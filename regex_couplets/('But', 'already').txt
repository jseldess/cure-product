('But', 'already')

But that is beside the point
So I presume the offers already

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

But my not feeling the memory aside
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

But my not feeling the memory inside
with dawn already formerly nights 

But my feeling the memory aside
already brought into privacy
