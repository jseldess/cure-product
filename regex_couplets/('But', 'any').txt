('but', 'any')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

but not impart cynicism
at any time it can drift again

Attributable or
Or the company

but the sun isn’t up
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

but it continued
The entire company

but it continued rippling muscle
That company creates a life

but would I love her the same
there wasn’t any television 

but they are black spots
not many face up

but I can hear them
in not many tracks up in the sky

I resume attributable visions
I walk up and don’t work anymore

but where is it
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

that decisions can be attributable
The many transparent pixel calls

but for memory elsewhere
or imagined anyway

decisions that can be attributable
