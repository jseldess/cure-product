('But', 'are')

But that is beside the point
Though there are quarters goals

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
who are so fresh and agile

But in more 
barely outlines

But would I love her the same
but they are black spots

But my not feeling the memory aside
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

But my not feeling the memory inside
Though we are waiting 

But my feeling the memory aside
That are my right to say
