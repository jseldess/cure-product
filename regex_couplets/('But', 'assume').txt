('but', 'assume')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
I assumed it was visible

but not impart cynicism
I assumed 

that decisions can be attributable
I assumed what I draw

but for memory elsewhere
I assume the offers reliable

decisions that can be attributable
I assume the offers revisitable

revisions that can be attributable
I assumed that they were divisible
