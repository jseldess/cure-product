('but', 'bill')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
I hear it between bills and stuff

but the sun isn’t up
I can hear it between bills and stuff

but would I love her the same
I can hear them between bills and stuff

but I can hear them
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

I resume attributable visions
billowing in the cloud

attributable visions
until the bill came

that decisions can be attributable
the bill my detuning 

decisions that can be attributable
between bills and stuffed animals

revisions that can be attributable
