('but', 'blend')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
battery dawn nights blending themselves

but not impart cynicism
walking into percents blending themselves

I resume attributable visions
where I blend and relive

that decisions can be attributable
where lights blended themselves

but for memory elsewhere
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

decisions that can be attributable
