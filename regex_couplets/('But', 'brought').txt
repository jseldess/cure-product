('But', 'brought')

But that is beside the point
at home brought into privacy

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
I brought my head down

But not to me directly
which I brought down with qualities

But would I love her the same
own stays brought loyal

But my not feeling the memory inside
own that stays brought loyal

But my not feeling the memory aside
already brought into privacy
