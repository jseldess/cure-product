('But', 'but')

But that is beside the point
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
but not impart cynicism

But I can’t let myself treat 
Attributable or

But not to me directly
but the sun isn’t up

But would I love her the same
but they are black spots

But my not feeling the memory aside
that decisions can be attributable

But my not feeling the memory inside
but for memory elsewhere
