('But', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

But that is beside the point
I can’t fix them without direction

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

But not to impart cynicism
Then I can’t presume to feed others

But I can’t let myself disregard
That can’t be glimpsed

But would I love her the same
Though we can’t help waiting

But my not feeling the memory inside
I can’t remember them
