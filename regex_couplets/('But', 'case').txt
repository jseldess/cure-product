('But', 'case')

But that is beside the point
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
only in the case

But not to me directly
I ask say in that case

But my not feeling the memory inside
we ask say in that case

But my not feeling the memory aside
