('But', 'children')

But that is beside the point
On a snow day with my children

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
as pure as my children

But I can’t let myself treat 
To my children Walt Whitman

But not to impart cynicism
To my children

But in more 
Even the children

But my not feeling the memory aside
my possession of my children

But my not feeling the memory inside
speech my possession of my children

But my feeling the memory aside
