('but', 'code')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
as long as I have access to the code

but not impart cynicism
May I have your zip code

but the sun isn’t up
falling off the encoded end

but would I love her the same
encoded off the end

but they are black spots
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

that decisions can be attributable
zipcode

but for memory elsewhere
