('but', 'come')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

but not impart cynicism
Strategy comes before morning

but the sun isn’t up
Strategy comes before goals

but it continued
and that man comes on to tell me 

that decisions can be attributable
and come home to remind inflections
