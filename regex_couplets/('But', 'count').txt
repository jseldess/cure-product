('but', 'count')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
Then I constellate my time family country

Attributable or
I brought my count down

but the sun isn’t up
without the long time I was accounting

but they are black spots
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I resume attributable visions
So I constellate the time family country

but where is it
without the long time I was on accounting

attributable visions
More reasons around my country 

that decisions can be attributable
