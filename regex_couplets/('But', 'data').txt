('but', 'data')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
I’ll pull my data higher up

Attributable or
I’ll pull my data

but the sun isn’t up
The days of private data

but it continued rippling muscle
The days of public data

but would I love her the same
trackers collecting data on users

that decisions can be attributable
my interfaced stand data

but for memory elsewhere
