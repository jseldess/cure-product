('But', 'dawn')

But that is beside the point
battery dawn nights blending themselves

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
Forecasting the story before dawn

But would I love her the same
dawn already formerly nights 

But my not feeling the memory aside
dawn formerly

But my not feeling the memory inside
battery dawn nights 

But my feeling the memory aside
battery dawn nights ending themselves
