('but', 'do')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

but not impart cynicism
does not feel an exception

I want but not to impart cynicism
The dogs and lillies

Attributable or
I brought my head down

but the sun isn’t up
What I do in my liesure

but they are black spots
I walk up and don’t work anymore

but where is it
here is the site of the battle of maldon

that decisions can be attributable
and it doesn’t take long

but for memory elsewhere
I only think I don’t listen

but I own all that’s messageable
