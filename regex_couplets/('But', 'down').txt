('But', 'down')

But that is beside the point
in a sharp downward turn 

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
In a sharp downard turn

But I can’t let myself treat 
to the down arrow

But I can’t let myself disregard
I brought my head down

But not to me directly
which I brought down with qualities

But would I love her the same
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

But my not feeling the memory aside
