('but', 'eat')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
too sunny to eat ice cream

but not impart cynicism
But I can’t let myself treat 

Attributable or
Where I put it beating

but the sun isn’t up
of the habits I create

but it continued
That company creates a life

but it continued rippling muscle
it was not just a defeat

but where is it
And from that great distance

that decisions can be attributable
for the creation of the universe

but for memory elsewhere
