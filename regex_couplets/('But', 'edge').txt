('But', 'edge')

But that is beside the point
I step off the edge

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Face falling off the edge of the face

But I can’t let myself treat 
off the edge of the world

But in more 
value falling off the edge of the face

But not to me directly
Falling off the edge of the face

But would I love her the same
