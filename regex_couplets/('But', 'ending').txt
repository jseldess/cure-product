('but', 'ending')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
battery dawn nights blending themselves

but not impart cynicism
I tried to feel the key values extending 

but it continued
talking into pheasants bending themselves

but they are black spots
talking into percents bending themselves

I resume attributable visions
walking into percents blending themselves

attributable visions
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

that decisions can be attributable
battery dawn nights ending themselves

but for memory elsewhere
