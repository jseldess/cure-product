('but', 'enter')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
I have entered my phone

but not impart cynicism
The sun high enough to enter directly 

but where is it
I enter the flattening mirror

I resume attributable visions
I have entered my purposes

that decisions can be attributable
I had entered my phone

but for memory elsewhere
