('But', 'fall')

But that is beside the point
Then fall then summer from my face

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
and not falling at all

But in more 
Face falling off the edge of the face

But not to me directly
Then fall then summer

But would I love her the same
I take it out in the snow fall

But my not feeling the memory aside
