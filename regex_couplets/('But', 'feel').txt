('But', 'feel')

But that is beside the point
conversations with our feelings

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

But not to impart cynicism
I tried to feel the key values extending 

But would I love her the same
But my not feeling the memory aside

But my not feeling the memory inside
which feels most comfortable

But my feeling the memory aside
which I feel formerly about for
