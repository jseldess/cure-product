('But', 'form')

But that is beside the point
There are performance reviews

But in more 
Toward the start informally given my reasons

But my not feeling the memory aside
A way formerly like this one

But my not feeling the memory inside
dawn formerly

But my feeling the memory aside
which I feel formerly about for
