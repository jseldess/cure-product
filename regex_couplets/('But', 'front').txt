('But', 'front')

But that is beside the point
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

But not to me directly
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

But would I love her the same
And need out in front purchase

But my not feeling the memory aside
behind or out front or up above
