('But', 'get')

But that is beside the point
I’ll get there eventually

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
and is relentlessly budgeted

But not to impart cynicism
I’ll get there ruins

But would I love her the same
I get through there

But my not feeling the memory aside
forgetting decisions 

But my not feeling the memory inside
forgettable
