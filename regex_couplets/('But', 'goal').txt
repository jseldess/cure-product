('but', 'goal')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
Though there are quarters goals

but not impart cynicism
and without quartely goals

Attributable or
before morning goals

but the sun isn’t up
Strategy comes before goals

but it continued
What would I feel without that goal

but they are black spots
