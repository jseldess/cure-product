('But', 'going')

But that is beside the point
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

But my not feeling the memory aside
The way that she is going

But my not feeling the memory inside
The way that I am going

But my feeling the memory aside
