('But', 'have')

But that is beside the point
We’ll have coffee this morning

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
I have entered my phone

But I can’t let myself treat 
if you have providence to excess

But in more 
If you have confidence regardless all else

But not to me directly
I have them lost

But my not feeling the memory aside
I have entered my purposes

But my not feeling the memory inside
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

But my feeling the memory aside
I have them trust in me
