('but', 'Having')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
Having transitioned from leisure to work

but the sun isn’t up
Having been purchased out of you

that decisions can be attributable
Having seen more than 

but for memory elsewhere
Having seen more than I can remember 

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
