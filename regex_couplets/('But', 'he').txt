('but', 'he')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

but not impart cynicism
others desires

I want but not to impart cynicism
The sun isn’t up

Attributable or
 and time in the train

but the sun isn’t up
Then I cannot see face value

but it continued
off the end myself

but it continued rippling muscle
And as an extension of the values

but would I love her the same
talking into pheasants bending themselves

but they are black spots
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

but I can hear them
The long time I had a vision

I resume attributable visions
without the long time I was accounting

but where is it
Then I saw into you

attributable visions
I get through there

that decisions can be attributable
the way was water

but for memory elsewhere
in memory persisting elsewhere

but standing in memory
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

decisions that can be attributable
phrase them

revisions that can be attributable
The prospects there already

but I own all that’s messageable
traffick is there nonetheless

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
I presume to others

in that decisions can be attributable
The sun high enough to strike directly
