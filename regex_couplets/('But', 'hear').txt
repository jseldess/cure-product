('But', 'hear')

But that is beside the point
You can hear it also through your leisure

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
and my heart rate

But not to me directly
Spinning around the heart

But would I love her the same
I can hear it between bills and stuff

But my not feeling the memory aside
In my heart did I lose trust

But my not feeling the memory inside
