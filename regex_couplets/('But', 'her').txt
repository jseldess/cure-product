But that is beside the point
Where I sleep at times

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
I told her a story, she drew waves.

But I can’t let myself treat 
others desires

But not to impart cynicism
I’ll pull myself another personality type

But in more 
here described

But I can’t let myself disregard
Others desires as legitimate

But not to me directly
Where I put it beating

But would I love her the same
there was no walking along the pleasure

But my not feeling the memory aside
where I send and relive aside

But my not feeling the memory inside
where I send and relive

But my feeling the memory aside
firing and connecting somewhere

But my not 
By my memory elsewhere
