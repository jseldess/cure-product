('but', 'here')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
Of course there is a direction

but not impart cynicism
I’ll get there eventually

Attributable or
Where official policy is to catch and release

but the sun isn’t up
there was no promotion

but it continued
There was very little physical activity

but it continued rippling muscle
that potential is there for you

but would I love her the same
Where I take my liesure

but they are black spots
there was no television to hear

I resume attributable visions
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

but where is it
I get through there

attributable visions
I get from here through there

that decisions can be attributable
Is there a baby and a bear

but for memory elsewhere
in memory persisting elsewhere

but standing in memory
where rights ended themselves

decisions that can be attributable
The prospects there already

revisions that can be attributable
The offers there already

but I own all that’s messageable
traffick is there nonetheless

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
