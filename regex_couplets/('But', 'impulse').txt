('But', 'impulse')

But that is beside the point
impulse control

But would I love her the same
I send and retrieve the impulse

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

But my not feeling the memory inside
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

But my feeling the memory aside
