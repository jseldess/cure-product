No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation.

with internally regulated climate

but it continued
Then I saw them interview

I resume attributable visions
my interfaced stand data

but for memory elsewhere
 as points which are my interest 

decisions that can be attributable
