('But', 'isn\xe2\x80\x99t')

But that is beside the point
The sun isn’t up 

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then the sun isn’t available

But in more 
Then the sun isn’t up

But not to me directly
but the sun isn’t up

But would I love her the same
