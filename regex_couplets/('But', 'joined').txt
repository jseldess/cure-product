('but', 'joined')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
I was enjoined to act again myself

Attributable or
I was enjoined to act again

but the sun isn’t up
I was enjoined to act

but it continued
I am enjoined to act again

but it continued rippling muscle
joined in my television

but for memory elsewhere
