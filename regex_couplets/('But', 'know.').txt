('but', 'know.')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
who knows the way

but not impart cynicism
I even know what I would find

but I can hear them
even when close to my knowing

I resume attributable visions
When closed to my knowing

that decisions can be attributable
who knows how to turn it off

but for memory elsewhere
that their knowing

decisions that can be attributable
