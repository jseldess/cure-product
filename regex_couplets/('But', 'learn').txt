('but', 'learn')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
in light of learning what we see

but not impart cynicism
I spend time online learning to code

but the sun isn’t up
decisioned to learn 

that decisions can be attributable
decisioned to learn back

but for memory elsewhere
I learned my location

decisions that can be attributable
phase decision for learning

revisions that can be attributable
