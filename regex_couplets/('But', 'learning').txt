('but', 'learning')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
in light of learning what we see

but not impart cynicism
I spend time online learning to code

but the sun isn’t up
phase decision for learning

that decisions can be attributable
for learning by the prospect

but for memory elsewhere
a precision for learning

revisions that can be attributable
