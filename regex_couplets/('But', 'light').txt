('But', 'light')

But that is beside the point
variegated reflected light

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

But I can’t let myself treat 
stopped light with validated fields

But my not feeling the memory inside
where lights blended themselves

But my not feeling the memory aside
