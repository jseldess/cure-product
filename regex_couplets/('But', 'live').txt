('But', 'live')

But that is beside the point
I am to end my connections suspended live

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Which is a measure to never live out

But I can’t let myself treat 
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

But in more 
Which is a pleasure to never live out

But not to me directly
where I send and relive aside

But my not feeling the memory aside
where I stand and relive

But my not feeling the memory inside
where I send and relive

But my feeling the memory aside
