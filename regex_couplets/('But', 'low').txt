('but', 'low')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
slow

but not impart cynicism
slow asynchronous

I want but not to impart cynicism
to the pillow

Attributable or
low in the content architecture

but the sun isn’t up
I am not allowed to see their face

but it continued
under pillowing a cloud

I resume attributable visions
