('but', 'man')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

but not impart cynicism
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

I want but not to impart cynicism
To my children Walt Whitman

Attributable or
not many face up

but I can hear them
in not many tracks up in the sky

I resume attributable visions
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

that decisions can be attributable
The many transparent pixel calls

but for memory elsewhere
