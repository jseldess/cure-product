('but', 'move')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
since I can imagine movement

but it continued rippling muscle
with little reason to move

but would I love her the same
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

that decisions can be attributable
not literally moved about

but for memory elsewhere
not literally moved

decisions that can be attributable
