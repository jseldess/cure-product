('But', 'need')

But that is beside the point
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

But not to impart cynicism
drifting away needs

But in more 
drifting away needs others presume desires

But I can’t let myself disregard
I need the work

But my not feeling the memory aside
not needing to wait

But my not feeling the memory inside
in need one in that best own

But my feeling the memory aside
need one in best own
