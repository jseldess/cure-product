('But', 'night')

But that is beside the point
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
battery dawn nights blending themselves

But I can’t let myself treat 
blue and sun again a second, then night

But would I love her the same
dawn already formerly nights 

But my not feeling the memory aside
last night

But my not feeling the memory inside
battery dawn nights 

But my feeling the memory aside
battery dawn nights ending themselves
