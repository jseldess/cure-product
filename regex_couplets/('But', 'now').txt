('but', 'now')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
on a snow day with my children

but not impart cynicism
Right now I’m the cart

Attributable or
out in the snow

but the sun isn’t up
out in the snow fall

but it continued
I take it out in the snow fall

but they are black spots
I even know what I would find

but I can hear them
even when close to my knowing

I resume attributable visions
When closed to my knowing

that decisions can be attributable
who knows how to turn it off

but for memory elsewhere
that their knowing

decisions that can be attributable
