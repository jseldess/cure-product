('but', 'offer')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
in the form filled offered in trust

that decisions can be attributable
in track as offer asked 

but for memory elsewhere
I assume the offers reliable

decisions that can be attributable
So I presume the offers already

revisions that can be attributable
The offers there already

but I own all that’s messageable
I presume the offers

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
Or can have seen offering possession
