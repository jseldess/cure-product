('But', 'only')

But that is beside the point
only fragments of time with my children

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
only in the case

But not to me directly
So that I notice I am the only one

But would I love her the same
would only willingly break

But my not feeling the memory inside
if only on the way to the trash
