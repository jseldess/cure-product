('But', 'other')

But that is beside the point
I’ll pull myself another personality type

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
others desires

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

But not to impart cynicism
If I let myself see others desires

But I can’t let myself disregard
On the other hand

But my not feeling the memory aside
and other types of tracking technology

But my not feeling the memory inside
I presume to others

But my feeling the memory aside
Cereal and others’ health
