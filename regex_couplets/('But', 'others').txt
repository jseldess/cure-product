('But', 'others')

But that is beside the point
others desires

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

But not to impart cynicism
If I let myself see others desires

But I can’t let myself disregard
I presume to others

But my not feeling the memory inside
Cereal and others’ health
