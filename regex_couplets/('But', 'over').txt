('But', 'over')

But that is beside the point
I step over the edge

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
over the long time up in the sky

But in more 
over the time line I was on

But not to me directly
hovering above standing water

But would I love her the same
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

But my not feeling the memory aside
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

But my not feeling the memory inside
for not paying sound overwhelmed

But my feeling the memory aside
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
