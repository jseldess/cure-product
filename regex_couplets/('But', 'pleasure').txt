('but', 'pleasure')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

but not impart cynicism
Which is a pleasure to never live out

Attributable or
there was no walking along the pleasure

but they are black spots
up in the television pleasure

but I can hear them
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I resume attributable visions
