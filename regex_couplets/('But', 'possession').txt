('but', 'possession')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
I speak to them my possessions

that decisions can be attributable
my possession of my children

but for memory elsewhere
I stay the right of my possessions 

decisions that can be attributable
possessions

revisions that can be attributable
Or can have seen offering possession
