('But', 'presume')

But that is beside the point
So I presume the offers already

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
and can’t presume to need

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

But not to impart cynicism
drifting away needs others presume desires

But I can’t let myself disregard
I continue to presume

But my not feeling the memory aside
I presume to others

But my not feeling the memory inside
I presume the offers
