('But', 'product')

But that is beside the point
an impure product

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
What is an impure product

But I can’t let myself treat 
as a pure product

But not to impart cynicism
as an impure product

But I can’t let myself disregard
the least productive of myself

But my not feeling the memory aside
