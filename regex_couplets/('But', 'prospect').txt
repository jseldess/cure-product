('But', 'prospect')

But that is beside the point
The prospects there already

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
the impulse for my own prospects

But my not feeling the memory aside
the impulse my own prospects

But my not feeling the memory inside
stopping into the prospect

But my feeling the memory aside
speech that is of by prospects
