('But', 'purchase')

But that is beside the point
conversations with our purchase

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
in traversing my purchase

But would I love her the same
purchased out

But my not feeling the memory aside
the impulse for my own purchases

But my not feeling the memory inside
for my own purchases

But my feeling the memory aside
at the site of a purchase
