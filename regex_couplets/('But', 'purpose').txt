('But', 'purpose')

But that is beside the point
by no ventillation my purpose

But in more 
until my purpose up in the sky

But would I love her the same
until I purpose the horizon

But my not feeling the memory aside
the impulse for my own purposes

But my not feeling the memory inside
the impulse to my purpose

But my feeling the memory aside
for my own purposes
