('But', 'really')

But that is beside the point
because it was really dark

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
it was really sunny

But I can’t let myself treat 
When they really take hold of my finger

But would I love her the same
without really agreeing

But my not feeling the memory aside
without really speaking

But my not feeling the memory inside
without really branding 

But my feeling the memory aside
also didn’t really move
