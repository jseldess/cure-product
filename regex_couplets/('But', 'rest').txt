('but', 'rest')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
wrestling to stay still

but not impart cynicism

that decisions can be attributable
Aligned or not with my interests

but for memory elsewhere
 as points which are my interest 

decisions that can be attributable
home rest form to ourselves 

revisions that can be attributable
