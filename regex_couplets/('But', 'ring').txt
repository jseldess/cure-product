('but', 'ring')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
interferring 

but not impart cynicism
bring your child along

Attributable or
hovering above standing water

but the sun isn’t up
actually considering the end

but I can hear them
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I resume attributable visions
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

attributable visions
storing in surfeit

that decisions can be attributable
firing and connecting somewhere

but for memory elsewhere
The prospect for veering healthily

revisions that can be attributable
Or can have seen offering possession
