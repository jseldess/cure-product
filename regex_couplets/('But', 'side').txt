('but', 'side')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

but not impart cynicism
aside from the retinas

but it continued rippling muscle
actually considering the end

but I can hear them
But my not feeling the memory aside

that decisions can be attributable
But my not feeling the memory inside

but for memory elsewhere
