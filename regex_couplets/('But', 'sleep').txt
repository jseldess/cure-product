('But', 'sleep')

But that is beside the point
Where I sleep at times

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

But I can’t let myself treat 
That’s where I sleep at times

But I can’t let myself disregard
Interrupted sleep or

But not to me directly
While I should be sleeping 

But would I love her the same
like flattening sleep 

But my not feeling the memory aside
