('but', 'static')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
wrapped in static and explicit statements

but I can hear them
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I resume attributable visions
You can hear it also through static leisure

but where is it
while wrapped in explicit static

attributable visions
