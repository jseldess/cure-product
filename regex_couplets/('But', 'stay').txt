('but', 'stay')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
wrestling to stay still

but not impart cynicism
So stay with us

but it continued rippling muscle
own stays brought loyal

that decisions can be attributable
own that stays brought loyal

but for memory elsewhere
I stay the right of my elections

decisions that can be attributable
home stays brought loyal

revisions that can be attributable
