('But', 'step')

But that is beside the point
I step off the edge

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
I step over the edge

But I can’t let myself treat 
What the next step

But would I love her the same
from which to step off

But my not feeling the memory aside
step in by the prospect

But my not feeling the memory inside
phase decision step in

But my feeling the memory aside
step by into the prospect
