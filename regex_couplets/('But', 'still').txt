('But', 'still')

But that is beside the point
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

But I can’t let myself treat 
I love my daughter still

But would I love her the same
though we are still breaking in

But my not feeling the memory aside
still wash conserving

But my not feeling the memory inside
