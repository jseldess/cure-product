('but', 'talk')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

but the sun isn’t up
talking into pheasants bending themselves

but they are black spots
talking into percents bending themselves

I resume attributable visions
wearing trying talking into it

attributable visions
