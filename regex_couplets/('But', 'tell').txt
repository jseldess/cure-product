('but', 'tell')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
Then I constellate my time family country

Attributable or
The CEO tells me to embody values

but the sun isn’t up
I had to tell them the news

but it continued rippling muscle
So I constellate the time family country

but where is it
I tell you my purposes

that decisions can be attributable
