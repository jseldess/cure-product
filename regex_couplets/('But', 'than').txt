('but', 'than')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
It keeps coming down thankfully

but not impart cynicism
than solid ground

but they are black spots
Having seen more than 

that decisions can be attributable
Having seen more than I can remember 

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
I have seen more than I can remember

in that decisions can be attributable
