('But', 'themselves')

But that is beside the point
battery dawn nights blending themselves

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
talking into pheasants bending themselves

But would I love her the same
talking into percents bending themselves

But my not feeling the memory aside
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

But my not feeling the memory inside
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

But my feeling the memory aside
battery dawn nights ending themselves
