('but', 'time.')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

but not impart cynicism
where I sleep at times

Attributable or
 and time in the train

but the sun isn’t up
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

but it continued
The long time I had a vision

but they are black spots
without the long time I was accounting

but I can hear them
So I constellate the time family country

but where is it
The long time I was a vision

I resume attributable visions
which is the long time I was on

attributable visions
or alter of course the time anyway

that decisions can be attributable
formerly along time they were on

but for memory elsewhere
in the long time they were on

but standing in memory
time they were on

decisions that can be attributable
