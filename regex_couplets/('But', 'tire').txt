('but', 'tire')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

but it continued
The entire company

but it continued rippling muscle
until I could not tire 

but I can hear them
until I could not be tired

I resume attributable visions
for to tire as far back as my history

attributable visions
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

that decisions can be attributable
