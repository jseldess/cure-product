('but', 'top')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
stopped light with validated variegated fields

but not impart cynicism
stopping into the prospect

that decisions can be attributable
stopped light with validated fields

but for memory elsewhere
stopping in the middle

decisions that can be attributable
stopping off in all directions
