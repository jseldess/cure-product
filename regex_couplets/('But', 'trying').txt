('but', 'trying')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
when trying to feel the extension of key values

but it continued
that I hear without trying

but I can hear them
wearing trying talking into it

I resume attributable visions
I spun around trying to touch the spots

that decisions can be attributable
