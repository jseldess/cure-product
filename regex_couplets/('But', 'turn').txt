('but', 'turn')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
In a sharp downard turn

but not impart cynicism
in a sharp downward turn 

Attributable or
I keep turning back again myself

but the sun isn’t up
who knows how to turn it off

that decisions can be attributable
I turn not sad exactly

but for memory elsewhere
I return not sad exactly

decisions that can be attributable
