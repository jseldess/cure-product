('but', 'up?')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

but not impart cynicism
I want but not to impart cynicism

Attributable or
Interrupted sleep or

but the sun isn’t up
barely outlines

but it continued
I argued the days were longer

but it continued rippling muscle
And as an extension of the values

but would I love her the same
If I take a different measure

but they are black spots
black spots on a white surface

but I can hear them
I resume unassimilable visions

I resume attributable visions
in traversing my purchase

but where is it
Then I saw into you

attributable visions
attributable decisions

visions that can be attributable
that can be attributable

decisions that can be attributable
I continue to presume

of attributable visions
in traversing my purpose

that decisions can be attributable
converting sight into a purchase

but for memory elsewhere
I answered what I thought

but standing in memory
I thought

revisions that can be attributable
between bills and stuffed animals

but I own all that’s messageable
I presume the offers

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
I presume to others

in that decisions can be attributable
The sun high enough to strike directly
