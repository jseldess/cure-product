('but', 'us')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
asynchronous 

but not impart cynicism
slow asynchronous

I want but not to impart cynicism
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Attributable or
In a vertiginous dream

but the sun isn’t up
I just got a letter

but it continued
So stay with us

but it continued rippling muscle
I reuse unassimilable visions

but they are black spots
I reuse indelible tracks

but I can hear them
I want to cite a poem so usual

but where is it
I have them trust in me

I resume attributable visions
a futile joyous white sun

that decisions can be attributable
radiating from housing

but for memory elsewhere
