('but', 'use')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
because it was really dark

but not impart cynicism
You use the most essential parts

but the sun isn’t up
I reuse unassimilable visions

but they are black spots
I reuse indelible tracks

but I can hear them
I used my technology

that decisions can be attributable
