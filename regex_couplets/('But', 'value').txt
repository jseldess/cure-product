('But', 'value')

But that is beside the point
Then I cannot see face value

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
value falling off the edge of the face

But I can’t let myself treat 
And as an extension of the values

But in more 
The value falling off the edge of the face

But not to me directly
The value falling off the edge of th face

But would I love her the same
