('but', 'versing')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
in traversing my purchase

but they are black spots
though as for conversing

but I can hear them
of my purpose in versing

I resume attributable visions
in traversing my purpose

attributable visions
versing my circuit

that decisions can be attributable
