('but', 'very')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

but it continued
There was very little physical activity

but it continued rippling muscle
embodied everyday

but would I love her the same
They have very many choices

that decisions can be attributable
