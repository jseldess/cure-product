('but', 'visible')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
I assumed it was visible

but not impart cynicism
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

Attributable or
And make myself a visible

but the sun isn’t up
I assume the offers divisible

decisions that can be attributable
that they were divisible

revisions that can be attributable
I assumed that they were divisible
