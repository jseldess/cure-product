('but', 'walk')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
Before we walk across the wide field

but not impart cynicism
there was no walking along the pleasure

but they are black spots
I walk up and don’t work anymore

but where is it
walking into percents blending themselves

I resume attributable visions
