('But', 'ways')

But that is beside the point
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
always watching

But my not feeling the memory aside
deep into pathways from repeated travels

But my not feeling the memory inside
with constant ways 

But my feeling the memory aside
