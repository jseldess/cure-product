('but', 'will')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

but not impart cynicism
will not be the same

but I can hear them
that will spur me on

I resume attributable visions
would only willingly break

that decisions can be attributable
my daughter will learn 

but for memory elsewhere
