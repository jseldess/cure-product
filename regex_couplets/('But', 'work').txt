('but', 'work')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

but not impart cynicism
nor work in this way daily

Attributable or
Having transitioned from leisure to work

but the sun isn’t up
your bid to the next highest ranked network

but it continued
I need the work

but I can hear them
I walk up and don’t work anymore

but where is it
nor envy honest work

that decisions can be attributable
