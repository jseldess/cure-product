('But', 'world')

But that is beside the point
off the edge of the world

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Which can be pronounced to the world

But in more 
The world 

But not to me directly
off the end of the world

But would I love her the same
hauling off the end of the world

But my not feeling the memory aside
the opinions in my world

But my not feeling the memory inside
