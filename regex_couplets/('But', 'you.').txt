('but', 'you.')

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
Though how can you know without direction

but not impart cynicism
You can hear it also through your leisure

Attributable or
May I have your zip code

but the sun isn’t up
That you can see only the back of

but it continued
since you can imagine movement

but it continued rippling muscle
where you can earn more 

but they are black spots
If you have confidence regardless all else

I resume attributable visions
a futile joyous white sun

that decisions can be attributable
the young ripples inaudibly

decisions that can be attributable
