('For', 'IN')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

Forecasting the story before dawn
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

For an ungraspable time
By NATASHA SINGER

For my own purchases
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

Formerly a way like this one
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

Formerly away there are constant ways
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
