('For', 'My')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
My associations

For an ungraspable time
My purpose up in the sky

For an ungraspable purchase
My means without gravity

For Mitt Romney
My daughter with her way

Formerly a way like this one
My daughter helps too

Formerly away there are constant ways
My say to the elections

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
