('For', 'Thou')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

For an ungraspable time
Though we are waiting for her

For Mitt Romney
Though we are breaking 

For my own purchases
Though we are waiting 

Formerly a way like this one
Though we can’t help waiting

Formerly away there are constant ways
