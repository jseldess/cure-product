('For', 'Which')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Which is a measure to never live out

Forecasting the story before dawn
Which is a pleasure to never live out

For an ungraspable time
Which can be called confidence

For my own purchases
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

Formerly a way like this one
