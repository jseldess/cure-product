('For', 'any')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
at any time it can drift again

Forecasting the story before dawn
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

For an ungraspable time
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

For Mitt Romney
They have very many choices

For my own purchases
latency which doesn’t mean anything

Formerly a way like this one
The many transparent pixel calls

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
or imagined anyway

For a while I think I don’t listen
