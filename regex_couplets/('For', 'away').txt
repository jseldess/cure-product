('For', 'away')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
drifting away

For whom drifting is not an exception
drifting away needs

Forecasting the story before dawn
Who throws contours away

Formerly a way like this one
Formerly away there are constant ways

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
formerly away

Forty-one seconds in
