('For', 'battery')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
battery dawn nights blending themselves

For an ungraspable time
battery dawn nights 

Formerly a way like this one
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
to the other end battery dawn 

Forty-one seconds in
battery dawn nights ending themselves

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
