('For', 'call')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
though it was most emphatically that

Forecasting the story before dawn
They are called aspirational

For an ungraspable time
Which can be called confidence

For my own purchases
to take the call

Formerly a way like this one
The many transparent pixel calls

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
recalling aside

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
