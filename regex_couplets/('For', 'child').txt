('For', 'child')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
To my children Walt Whitman

For whom drifting is not an exception
To my children

For whom 
bring your child along

Forecasting the story before dawn
even my child

For an ungraspable time
Even the children

For an ungraspable purchase
my possession of my children

Formerly a way like this one
speech my possession of my children

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
