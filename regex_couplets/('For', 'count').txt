('For', 'count')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting is not an exception
So I constellate the time family country

Forecasting the story before dawn
without the long time I was accounting

For an ungraspable time
More reasons around my country 

For my own purchases
