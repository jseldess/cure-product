('For', 'do')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
in a sharp downward turn 

For whom drifting is not an exception
What does it mean to drift

Forecasting the story before dawn
the dogs and lillies

For an ungraspable time
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

For Mitt Romney
and it doesn’t take long

Formerly a way like this one
I only think I don’t listen

For a while I think I don’t listen
