('For', 'earn')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
When we had jobs that were to earn

Forecasting the story before dawn
learned without too much difficulty to code

For an ungraspable time
decisioned to learn 

Formerly a way like this one
decisioned to learn back

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
