('For', 'eat')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Forecasting the story before dawn
executive breath

For an ungraspable time
And from that great distance

For Mitt Romney
was not just a defeat

For my own purchases
for the creation of the universe

Formerly a way like this one
burrowed about from repeated travels

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
