('For', 'else')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
If you have confidence regardless all else

Forecasting the story before dawn
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

For Mitt Romney
and elsewhere my memory of you

For my own purchases
elsewhere by my memory

Formerly a way like this one
By my memory elsewhere

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
