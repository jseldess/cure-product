('For', 'has')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
It has been since

Forecasting the story before dawn
in traversing my purchase

For an ungraspable time
And need out in front purchase

For an ungraspable purchase
Having been purchased out of you

For Mitt Romney
I have entered my purchases

For my own purchases
impulse for my own purchases

Formerly a way like this one
He has turned it off

Formerly away there are constant ways
phase decisioned by the prospect

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
converting sight into a purchase
