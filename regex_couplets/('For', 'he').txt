('For', 'he')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting is not an exception
without imparting the cynicism

Forecasting the story before dawn
The sun shielding 

For an ungraspable time
under the grasp principle

For an ungraspable purchase
up in the sky

For Mitt Romney
To neither study

For my own purchases
I send and retrieve the impulse

Formerly a way like this one
to the other end

Formerly away there are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
There are constant ways

Forty-one seconds in
to the other end of actions

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
traffick is there nonetheless
