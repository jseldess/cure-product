('For', 'here')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
where I sleep at times

For whom drifting is not an exception
I’ll get there eventually

Forecasting the story before dawn
there was no promotion

For an ungraspable time
We had to say goodbye there

For an ungraspable purchase
 of those gathered

For Mitt Romney
and elsewhere my memory of you

For my own purchases
where I send and relive aside

Formerly a way like this one
Is there a baby and a bear

Formerly away there are constant ways
There are no constant waves

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
There are constant ways

Forty-one seconds in
where rights ended themselves

For a while I think I don’t listen
traffick is there nonetheless
