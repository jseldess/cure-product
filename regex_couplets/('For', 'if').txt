('For', 'if')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
drifting away

For whom drifting is not an exception
What does it mean to drift

Forecasting the story before dawn
learned without too much difficulty to code

For an ungraspable time
if there is anything 

For Mitt Romney
if you have providence

For my own purchases
if that has anything

Formerly a way like this one
if only on the way to the trash

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
