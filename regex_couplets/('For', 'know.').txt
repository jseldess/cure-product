('For', 'know.')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
I even know what I would find

For an ungraspable time
knowing the constituents

Formerly a way like this one
who knows how to turn it off

Formerly away there are constant ways
who knows the way

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
that their knowing

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
