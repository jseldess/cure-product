('For', 'learn')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
I spend time online learning to code

Forecasting the story before dawn
learned without too much difficulty to code

For an ungraspable time
decisioned to learn 

Formerly a way like this one
decisioned to learn back

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
