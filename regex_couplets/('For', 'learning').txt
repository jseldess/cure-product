('For', 'learning')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
I spend time online learning to code

Forecasting the story before dawn
Then I am learning to code

For an ungraspable time
phase decision for learning

Formerly a way like this one
for learning by the prospect

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
