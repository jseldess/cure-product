('For', 'man')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
To my children Walt Whitman

For whom drifting is not an exception
What Whitman

For whom 
Walt Whitman drifted

Forecasting the story before dawn
not many face up

For an ungraspable time
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

For Mitt Romney
They have very many choices

For my own purchases
and that man comes on to tell me 

Formerly a way like this one
The many transparent pixel calls

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
