('For', 'mean')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
What does it mean to drift

Forecasting the story before dawn
My means without gravity

For Mitt Romney
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

Formerly a way like this one
The other end of means

Formerly away there are constant ways
To the other end of means like this one

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
