('For', 'most')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
though it was most emphatically that

Forecasting the story before dawn
I invited most of what came next

For an ungraspable time
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

For my own purchases
which feels most comfortable

Formerly a way like this one
mostly along cables

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
