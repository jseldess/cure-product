('For', 'move')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
since I can imagine movement

For an ungraspable time
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

For Mitt Romney
myself moved literally as it is

Formerly a way like this one
not literally moved about

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
