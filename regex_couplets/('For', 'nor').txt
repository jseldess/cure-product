('For', 'nor')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
over the long line I would honor

Forecasting the story before dawn
the simple act of honoring an accountant

For an ungraspable time
nor work in this way daily

For Mitt Romney
nor envy honest work

For my own purchases
which had on honor to be told

Formerly a way like this one
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
