('For', 'our')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
reasons resources

For whom drifting is not an exception
bring your child along

Forecasting the story before dawn
or an available resource

For an ungraspable time
or alter of course the time anyway

For Mitt Romney
This is your voice 

For my own purchases
Who throws contours away

Formerly a way like this one
who throws contours a way

Formerly away there are constant ways
The contours exchange with you

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
phrase them of our possessions

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
