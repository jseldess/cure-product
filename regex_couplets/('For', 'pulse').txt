('For', 'pulse')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
impulse control

Forecasting the story before dawn
I send and retrieve the impulse

For my own purchases
I stand and retrieve the impulse

Formerly a way like this one
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

Formerly away there are constant ways
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

Forty-one seconds in
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
