('For', 'reasons')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
reasons resources

For whom drifting is not an exception
with reasons

Forecasting the story before dawn
with little reasons to aspiration

For an ungraspable time
More reasons around my country 

For my own purchases
and could be inflected with reasons

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
