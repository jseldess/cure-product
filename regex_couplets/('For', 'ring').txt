('For', 'ring')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
bring your child along

Forecasting the story before dawn
actually considering the end

For an ungraspable time
storing in surfeit

For an ungraspable purchase
firing and connecting somewhere

Formerly a way like this one
The prospect for veering healthily
