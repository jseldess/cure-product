('For', 'set')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
upset by Gingrich

Forecasting the story before dawn
in front of the set afternoon

For an ungraspable time
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

For Mitt Romney
Um, upset by Gingrich

For my own purchases
presets

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
