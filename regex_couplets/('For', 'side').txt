('For', 'side')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
aside from the retinas

For an ungraspable time
But my not feeling the memory aside

For my own purchases
where I send and relive aside

Formerly a way like this one
But my not feeling the memory inside

Formerly away there are constant ways
By my feeling the memory inside

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
44 seconds inside

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
