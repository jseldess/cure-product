('For', 'so')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
reasons resources

For whom drifting is not an exception
who are so fresh and agile

Forecasting the story before dawn
or an available resource

For an ungraspable time
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

For Mitt Romney
More reasons around my country 

For my own purchases
and sound redundant

Formerly a way like this one
by in the sound privacy

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
and could be inflected with reasons
