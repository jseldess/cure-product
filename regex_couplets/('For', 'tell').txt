('For', 'tell')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting is not an exception
So I constellate the time family country

Forecasting the story before dawn
I had to tell them the news

For an ungraspable time
I tell you my purposes

For Mitt Romney
and that man comes on to tell me 

Formerly a way like this one
