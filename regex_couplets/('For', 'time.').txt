('For', 'time.')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting is not an exception
over the long time up in the sky

Forecasting the story before dawn
on the time line I was on

For an ungraspable time
or alter of course the time anyway

For Mitt Romney
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

For my own purchases
until a happier time found

Formerly a way like this one
formerly along time they were on

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
