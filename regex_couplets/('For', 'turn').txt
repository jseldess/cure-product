('For', 'turn')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
in a sharp downward turn 

For whom drifting is not an exception
sudden downward turn

Forecasting the story before dawn
who knows how to turn it off

Formerly a way like this one
I turn not sad exactly

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
