('For', 'up?')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting is not an exception
But not to impart cynicism

For whom 
Without imparting cynicism 

Forecasting the story before dawn
The sun shielding 

For an ungraspable time
articles all around us

For an ungraspable purchase
up in the sky

For Mitt Romney
though it was most emphatically that

For my own purchases
and sound redundant

Formerly a way like this one
I end up Bach

Formerly away there are constant ways
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
I end up in Bach

Forty-one seconds in
to the other end of my purpose

For a while I think I don’t listen
but I own all that’s messageable
