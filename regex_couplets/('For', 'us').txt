('For', 'us')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Forecasting the story before dawn
The ventillation rushes on

For an ungraspable time
articles all around us

For an ungraspable purchase
I wear suspenders

For Mitt Romney
was not just a defeat

For my own purchases
useless for not having paid

Formerly a way like this one
radiating from housing

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
