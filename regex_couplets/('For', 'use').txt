('For', 'use')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
You use the most essential parts

Forecasting the story before dawn
I reuse unassimilable visions

For an ungraspable time
I used my technology

For Mitt Romney
trackers collecting data on users

For my own purchases
useless for not having paid

Formerly a way like this one
