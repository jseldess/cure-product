('For', 'wait')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
There are spots waiting

For Mitt Romney
Though we are waiting for her

For my own purchases
not needing to wait

Formerly a way like this one
Though we can’t help waiting

Formerly away there are constant ways
waiting out front or up above 

For a while I think I don’t listen
