('For', 'you.')

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
bring your child along

Forecasting the story before dawn
That you can see only the back of

For an ungraspable time
I tell you my purposes

For Mitt Romney
This is your voice 

For my own purchases
the young ripples inaudibly

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
