('I\xe2\x80\x99ll', 'On')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
On a snow day with my children

I’ll get there eventually
One day there is direction

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
One year or

I’ll get there ruins
On the bandwidth I was on

I’ll pull myself higher up
On the other hand
