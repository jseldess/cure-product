('I\xe2\x80\x99ll', 'Which')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Which is a measure to never live out

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
Which can be pronounced to the world

I’ll get there eventually
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I’ll get there ruins
Which can be called confidence
