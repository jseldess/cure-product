('I\xe2\x80\x99ll', 'do')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
in a sharp downward turn 

I’ll get there eventually
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
to the down arrow

I’ll pull my data higher up
The dogs and lillies

I’ll get there ruins
So that I don’t notice I am the only one
