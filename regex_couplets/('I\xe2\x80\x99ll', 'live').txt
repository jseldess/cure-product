('I\xe2\x80\x99ll', 'live')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Which is a measure to never live out

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I’ll get there eventually
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I’ll get there ruins
where I send and relive aside
