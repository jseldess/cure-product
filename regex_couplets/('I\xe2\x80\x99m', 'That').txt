('I\xe2\x80\x99m', 'That')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
That’s exaclty what I want for them

I’m simply inside
That is itself not still

Right now I’m the cart
That’s where I sleep at times

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
That you can see only the back of

where I’m watching my tv
That are my right to say
