The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
as long as I have access to the code

I’m simply inside
May I have your zip code

Right now I’m the cart
learned without too much difficulty to code

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
falling off the encoded end

where I’m watching my tv
zipcode
