('I\xe2\x80\x99m', 'eat')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
too sunny to eat ice cream

I’m simply inside
But I can’t let myself treat 

Right now I’m the cart
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
of the habits I create

where I’m watching my tv
for the creation of the universe
