The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

I’m simply inside
The sun isn’t up 

Right now I’m the cart
Face falling off the edge of the face

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
The ventillation rushes on

where I’m watching my tv
where I am aside
