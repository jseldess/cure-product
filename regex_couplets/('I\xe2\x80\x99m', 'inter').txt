('I\xe2\x80\x99m', 'inter')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

I’m simply inside
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

Right now I’m the cart
way high up in the inter

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
with internally regulated climate

where I’m watching my tv
my interfaced stand data
