('I\xe2\x80\x99m', 'learn')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
in light of learning what we see

I’m simply inside
I spend time online learning to code

Right now I’m the cart
learned without too much difficulty to code

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
decisioned to learn 

where I’m watching my tv
I learned my location
