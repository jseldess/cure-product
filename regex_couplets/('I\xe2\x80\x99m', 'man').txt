('I\xe2\x80\x99m', 'man')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

I’m simply inside
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Right now I’m the cart
There are performance reviews

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
not many face up

where I’m watching my tv
