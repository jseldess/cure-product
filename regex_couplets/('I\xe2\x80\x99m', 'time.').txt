('I\xe2\x80\x99m', 'time.')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

I’m simply inside
only fragments of time with my children

Right now I’m the cart
over the long time up in the sky

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

where I’m watching my tv
in the long time they were on
