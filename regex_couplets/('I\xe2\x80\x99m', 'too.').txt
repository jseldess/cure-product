('I\xe2\x80\x99m', 'too.')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
too sunny to eat ice cream

I’m simply inside
emerging this year from too much standing water

Right now I’m the cart
learned without too much difficulty to code

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
Selma knows too 

where I’m watching my tv
