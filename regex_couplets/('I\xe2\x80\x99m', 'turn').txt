('I\xe2\x80\x99m', 'turn')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
In a sharp downard turn

I’m simply inside
in a sharp downward turn 

Right now I’m the cart
sudden downward turn

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
who knows how to turn it off

where I’m watching my tv
I turn not sad exactly
