('I\xe2\x80\x99m', 'visible')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I assumed it was visible

I’m simply inside
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

Right now I’m the cart
And make myself a visible

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
I assume the offers divisible
