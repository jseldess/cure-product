('I\xe2\x80\x99m', 'you.')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Though how can you know without direction

Right now I’m the cart
You can hear it also through your leisure

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
That you can see only the back of

where I’m watching my tv
the young ripples inaudibly
