('If', 'And')

If I step on the edge
And as an extension of the values

If I let myself see others desires
And make myself a visible

If he had not carried one virtue
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

If articles can storm in excess
And need out in front purchase

If you have confidence regardless all else
