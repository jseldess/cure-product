('If', 'For')

If I step on the edge
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

If I let myself see others desires
Forecasting the story before dawn

If I take a different measure
For an ungraspable time

If articles can storm in excess
For an ungraspable purchase

If you have confidence regardless all else
For my own purchases
