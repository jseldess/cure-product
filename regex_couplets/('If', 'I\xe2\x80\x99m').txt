drifting away
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

if not directly on my skin
I’m simply inside

drifting does not feel an exception
Right now I’m the cart

drifting away needs
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

That company creates a life
where I’m watching my tv

if only on the way to the trash
