('if', 'IN')

drifting away
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

if you have providence to excess
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

learned without too much difficulty to code
THE PLANNING PROCESS

That company creates a life
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

if there is anything 
By NATASHA SINGER

if that has anything
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

if only on the way to the trash
