('if', 'so')

drifting away
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

if not directly on my skin
When I want something

drifting does not feel an exception
You can hear it also through your leisure

drifting away needs others presume desires
reasons resources

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
who are so fresh and agile

the drifting is not something special
Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type

drifting away needs
soft paper

at any time it can drift again
solvents

if you have providence to excess
I want to cite a poem so usual

if he had not carried one virtue 
A person from a distance

out of the fifth page ruins
or an available resource

learned without too much difficulty to code
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

That company creates a life
with little reason to aspiration

Life is with people
with little reason to move

If I take a different measure
If I take some different measure

if there is anything 
More reasons around my country 

if you have providence
sound inundated for my own purchases

if that has anything
so still watch them

if only on the way to the trash
and could be inflected with reasons
