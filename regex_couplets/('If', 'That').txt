('if', 'That')

drifting away
That’s exaclty what I want for them

if not directly on my skin
That is itself not still

drifting does not feel an exception
That’s where I sleep at times

drifting away from the task
That’s when they really take

out of the fifth page ruins
That you can see only the back of

That company creates a life
That I captured an afterimage

if there is anything 
That are my right to say

if only on the way to the trash
