('If', 'There')

If I step on the edge
There are quarterly goals

If I let myself see others desires
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

If he had not carried one virtue
There was very little physical activity

If I take a different measure
There are spots waiting

If you have confidence regardless all else
There are constant ways
