('if', 'Thou')

drifting away
Though there are quarters goals

drifting does not feel an exception
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

If I take a different measure
Though in not many acts

If I take some different measure
Though we are waiting for her

if there is anything 
Though we are breaking 

if that has anything
Though we can’t help waiting

if only on the way to the trash
