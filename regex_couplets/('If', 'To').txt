('If', 'To')

If I step on the edge
To my children Walt Whitman

If I let myself see others desires
To my chidren

If he had not carried one virtue
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

If you have confidence regardless all else
To neither study

If I take a different measure
Tomorrow

If I take some different measure
Toward the start informally given my reasons

If articles can storm in excess
To substitute neither study
