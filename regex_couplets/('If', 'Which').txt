('if', 'Which')

drifting away
Which is a measure to never live out

drifting away needs others presume desires
Which can be pronounced to the world

if you have providence to excess
Which is a pleasure to never live out

if he had not carried one virtue 
Which can be called confidence

If I take a different measure
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

if only on the way to the trash
