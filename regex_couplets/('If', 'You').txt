('If', 'You')

If I step on the edge
You can hear it also through your leisure

If I let myself see others desires
You use the most essential parts

If I take a different measure
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

If I take some different measure
You can hear it also through static leisure

If you have confidence regardless all else
You need history

If articles can storm in excess
You can have seen offering
