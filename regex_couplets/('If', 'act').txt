('If', 'act')

If I step on the edge
I was enjoined to act again myself

If I let myself see others desires
I was enjoined to act again

If I take a different measure
actually considering the end

If I take some different measure
I refuse indelible tracts

If you have confidence regardless all else
we had inhabited actually
