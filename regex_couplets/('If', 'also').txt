('If', 'also')

If I step on the edge
You can hear it also through your leisure

If I let myself see others desires
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

If I take a different measure
I cannot clear it also through investiture

If I take some different measure
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

If you have confidence regardless all else
also didnâ€™t really move
