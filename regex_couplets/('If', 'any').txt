('if', 'any')

drifting away
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

if not directly on my skin
Before anyone walks across the opening

drifting does not feel an exception
at any time it can drift again

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Or the company

out of the fifth page ruins
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

That company creates a life
there wasnâ€™t any television 

If I take a different measure
not many face up

If I take some different measure
though not many facts up in the sky

if there is anything 
if that has anything

if you have providence
They have very many choices

if only on the way to the trash
