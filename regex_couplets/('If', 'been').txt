('If', 'been')

If I step on the edge
It has been since

If I let myself see others desires
After having been contented

If he had not carried one virtue
that having been after content

If I take a different measure
having been graspable

If I take some different measure
having been an ungraspable time

If articles can storm in excess
Having been purchased out of you

If you have confidence regardless all else
