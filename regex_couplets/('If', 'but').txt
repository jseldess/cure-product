('If', 'but')

If I step on the edge
but not impart cynicism

If I let myself see others desires
Attributable or

If I take a different measure
but they are black spots

If I take some different measure
but I can hear them

If you have confidence regardless all else
I resume attributable visions

If articles can storm in excess
that decisions can be attributable
