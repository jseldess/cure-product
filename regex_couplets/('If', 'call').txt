('if', 'call')

drifting away
not calling or echoing for once

if not directly on my skin
though it was most emphatically that

if you have providence to excess
Which can be called confidence

if he had not carried one virtue 
They are called aspirational

That company creates a life
to take the call

if there is anything 
The many transparent pixel calls

if only on the way to the trash
