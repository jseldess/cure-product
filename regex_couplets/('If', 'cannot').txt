('If', 'cannot')

If I step on the edge
Then I cannot see face value

If I let myself see others desires
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

If I take a different measure
I cannot clear it also through investiture

If I take some different measure
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

If you have confidence regardless all else
in that I cannot remember
