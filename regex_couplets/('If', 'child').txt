('if', 'child')

drifting away
On a snow day with my children

if not directly on my skin
especially in a child

drifting does not feel an exception
To my children Walt Whitman

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
To my children

What does it mean to drift
and bear children along

the drifting is not something special
even my child

if there is anything 
my possession of my children

if that has anything
speech my possession of my children

if only on the way to the trash
