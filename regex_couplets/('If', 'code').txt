('if', 'code')

drifting away
as long as I have access to the code

drifting does not feel an exception
May I have your zip code

out of the fifth page ruins
learned without too much difficulty to code

That company creates a life
falling off the encoded end

If I take a different measure
encoded off the end

If I take some different measure
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

if there is anything 
zipcode

if only on the way to the trash
