('if', 'count')

drifting away
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
So I constellate the time family country

if you have providence to excess
I brought my count down

out of the fifth page ruins
without the long time I was accounting

If I take a different measure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

If I take some different measure
around my country 

if there is anything 
More reasons around my country 

if you have providence
