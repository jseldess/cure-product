('if', 'data')

drifting away
I’ll pull my data higher up

if you have providence to excess
I’ll pull my data

learned without too much difficulty to code
The days of private data

That company creates a life
The days of public data

Life is with people
trackers collecting data on users

if there is anything 
my interfaced stand data

if only on the way to the trash
