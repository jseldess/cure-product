('if', 'do')

drifting away
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

if not directly on my skin
does not feel an exception

drifting does not feel an exception
The dogs and lillies

drifting away needs others presume desires
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

For whom drifting is not an exception
What does it mean to drift

the drifting is not something special
in a sharp downward turn 

drifting away needs
to the down arrow

drifting away from the task
sudden downward turn

if you have providence to excess
I brought my head down

out of the fifth page ruins
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

That company creates a life
What I do in my liesure

If I take a different measure
I walk up and don’t work anymore

If I take some different measure
here is the site of the battle of maldon

if there is anything 
and it doesn’t take long

if that has anything
latency which doesn’t mean anything

if only on the way to the trash
I only think I don’t listen
