drifting away
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

if not directly on my skin
does not feel an exception

drifting does not feel an exception
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

For whom drifting is not an exception
What does it mean to drift

the drifting is not something special
and it doesn’t take long

if there is anything 
latency which doesn’t mean anything

if that has anything
