('if', 'drift')

drifting away
drifting does not feel an exception

drifting away needs others presume desires
at any time it can drift again

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
For whom drifting is not an exception

What does it mean to drift
the drifting is not something special

Walt Whitman drifted
drifting away needs

drifting away from the task
in a moment of drifting away from the task

if you have providence to excess
