('if', 'drifting')

drifting away
drifting does not feel an exception

drifting away needs others presume desires
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

For whom drifting is not an exception
the drifting is not something special

Walt Whitman drifted
drifting away needs

at any time it can drift again
drifting away from the task

in a moment of drifting away from the task
