('if', 'earn')

drifting away
in light of learning what we see

if not directly on my skin
When we had jobs that were to earn

if you have providence to excess
I spend time online learning to code

out of the fifth page ruins
learned without too much difficulty to code

That company creates a life
where you can earn more 

If I take a different measure
decisioned to learn 

if there is anything 
decisioned to learn back

if only on the way to the trash
