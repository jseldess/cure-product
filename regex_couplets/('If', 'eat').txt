('if', 'eat')

drifting away
too sunny to eat ice cream

if not directly on my skin
But I can’t let myself treat 

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to treat others

at any time it can drift again
I let myself treat

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

drifting away from the task
executive breath

if you have providence to excess
was not just a defeat

out of the fifth page ruins
execute breath

learned without too much difficulty to code
of the habits I create

That company creates a life
it was not just a defeat

If I take a different measure
And from that great distance

if there is anything 
for the creation of the universe

if that has anything
burrowed about from repeated travels

if only on the way to the trash
