('if', 'else')

drifting away
If you have confidence regardless all else

if he had not carried one virtue 
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

if there is anything 
and elsewhere my memory

if you have providence
elsewhere my purposes

if that has anything
elsewhere by my memory

if only on the way to the trash
