('if', 'ending')

drifting away
battery dawn nights blending themselves

if not directly on my skin
I tried to feel the key values extending 

That company creates a life
talking into pheasants bending themselves

If I take a different measure
talking into percents bending themselves

If I take some different measure
walking into percents blending themselves

if there is anything 
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

if that has anything
battery dawn nights ending themselves

if only on the way to the trash
