('if', 'enter')

drifting away
I have entered my phone

if not directly on my skin
The sun high enough to enter directly 

If I take a different measure
I enter the flattening mirror

If I take some different measure
I have entered my purposes

if you have providence
I have entered my purchases

if there is anything 
I had entered my phone

if only on the way to the trash
