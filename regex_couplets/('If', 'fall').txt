('If', 'fall')

If I step on the edge
Then fall then summer

If I let myself see others desires
and not falling at all

If he had not carried one virtue
Face falling off the edge of the face

If I take a different measure
I take it out in the snow fall

If I take some different measure
falling off the end

If you have confidence regardless all else
