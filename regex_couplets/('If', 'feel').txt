('If', 'feel')

If I step on the edge
does not feel an exception

If I let myself see others desires
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

If he had not carried one virtue
I tried to feel the key values extending 

If I take a different measure
What would I feel without that goal

If I take some different measure
But my not feeling the memory aside
