('if', 'find')

drifting away
I want to find a way to block it incoming

if not directly on my skin
I can find a way to block it incoming

drifting does not feel an exception
Companies increasingly find 

That company creates a life
I even know what I would find

If I take a different measure
So I find myself at home

if only on the way to the trash
