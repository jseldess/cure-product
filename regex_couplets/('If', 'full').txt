('if', 'full')

drifting away
It keeps coming down thankfully

if not directly on my skin
I am full of potential

That company creates a life
full of aspirations

Life is with people
full of potential

If I take a different measure
full of the missing words

if there is anything 
still carefully

if only on the way to the trash
