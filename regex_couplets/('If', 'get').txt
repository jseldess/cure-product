('If', 'get')

If I step on the edge
I’ll get there eventually

If I let myself see others desires
and is relentlessly budgeted

If he had not carried one virtue
I’ll get there ruins

If I take a different measure
I get through there

If I take some different measure
I get from here through there

If articles can storm in excess
forgetting decisions
