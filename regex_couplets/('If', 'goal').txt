('if', 'goal')

drifting away
Though there are quarters goals

drifting does not feel an exception
and without quartely goals

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
There are quarterly goals

drifting away needs others presume desires
before morning goals

learned without too much difficulty to code
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

That company creates a life
What would I feel without that goal

If I take a different measure
