('if', 'he')

drifting away
Before we walk across the wide field

if not directly on my skin
Of course there is a direction

drifting does not feel an exception
The dogs and lillies

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I canâ€™t presume to need others

at any time it can drift again
others desires

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting is not an exception
without imparting the cynicism

What does it mean to drift
the drifting is not something special

Walt Whitman drifted
Then I cannot see face value

drifting away needs
There are quarterly goals

drifting away from the task
in a moment of drifting away from the task

if you have providence to excess
The world 

if he had not carried one virtue 
To neither study

out of the fifth page ruins
high up in the results

learned without too much difficulty to code
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

That company creates a life
And as an extension of the values

Life is with people
As an extension of the values

If I take a different measure
talking into pheasants bending themselves

If I take some different measure
The long time I had a vision

if there is anything 
I have a memory between the day

if you have providence
I send and retrieve the impulse

if that has anything
The floor slanted in places

if only on the way to the trash
the prospects there already
