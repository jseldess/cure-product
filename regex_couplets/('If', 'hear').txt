('If', 'hear')

If I step on the edge
You can hear it also through your leisure

If I let myself see others desires
and my heart rate

If I take a different measure
I can hear it between bills and stuff

If I take some different measure
that I can hear

If you have confidence regardless all else
In my heart did I lose trust
