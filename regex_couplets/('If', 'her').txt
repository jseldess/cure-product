('If', 'her')

If I step on the edge
what I find there

If I let myself see others desires
where I sleep at times

If he had not carried one virtue
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

If you have confidence regardless all else
To neither study

If I take a different measure
Where I take my liesure

If I take some different measure
On the other hand

If articles can storm in excess
We had to say goodbye there
