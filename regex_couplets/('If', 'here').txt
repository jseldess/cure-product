('if', 'here')

drifting away
Of course there is a direction

if not directly on my skin
One day there is direction

drifting does not feel an exception
I’ll get there eventually

drifting away needs others presume desires
where I sleep at times

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
There are quarterly goals

at any time it can drift again
That’s where I sleep at times

drifting away from the task
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

if you have providence to excess
here described

if he had not carried one virtue 
Where official policy is to catch and release

out of the fifth page ruins
where I can lay claim to ruins

learned without too much difficulty to code
there was no promotion

That company creates a life
that potential is there for you

Life is with people
There was very little physical activity

If I take a different measure
Where I take my liesure

If I take some different measure
there was no television to hear

if there is anything 
Where I host my purposes

if you have providence
where I send and relive aside

if that has anything
Where in me did I host

if only on the way to the trash
the prospects there already
