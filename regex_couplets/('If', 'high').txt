('if', 'high')

drifting away
way high up in the inter

if you have providence to excess
higher up in the results

out of the fifth page ruins
high up in the results

learned without too much difficulty to code
your bid to the next highest ranked network

That company creates a life
The sun high enough to enter directly 

If I take a different measure
The sun high enough to strike directly
