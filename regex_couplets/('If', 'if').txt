('If', 'if')

If I step on the edge
drifting does not feel an exception

If I let myself see others desires
drifting away needs others presume desires

If he had not carried one virtue
if you have providence to excess

If you have confidence regardless all else
out of the fifth page ruins

If I take a different measure
If I take some different measure

If articles can storm in excess
if there is anything
