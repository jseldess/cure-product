('if', 'inter')

drifting away
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

if not directly on my skin
interjecting on a day ambition

drifting does not feel an exception
way high up in the inter

if you have providence to excess
hold at intervals riding forward

out of the fifth page ruins
high up in the internet

learned without too much difficulty to code
with internally regulated climate

That company creates a life
Then I saw them interview

If I take a different measure
my interfaced stand data

if only on the way to the trash
