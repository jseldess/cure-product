('if', 'just')

drifting away
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

if not directly on my skin
Theyâ€™re just not mine

drifting does not feel an exception
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

drifting away needs others presume desires
was not just a defeat

out of the fifth page ruins
I just got a letter

That company creates a life
it was not just a defeat

If I take a different measure
