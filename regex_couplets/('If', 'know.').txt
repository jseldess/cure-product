('if', 'know.')

drifting away
who knows the way

if not directly on my skin
how can I know without direction

drifting does not feel an exception
I even know what I would find

If I take a different measure
even when close to my knowing

If I take some different measure
When closed to my knowing

if there is anything 
knowing the constituents

if that has anything
who knows how to turn it off

if only on the way to the trash
