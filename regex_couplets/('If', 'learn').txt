('if', 'learn')

drifting away
in light of learning what we see

if not directly on my skin
I spend time online learning to code

out of the fifth page ruins
learned without too much difficulty to code

That company creates a life
decisioned to learn 

if there is anything 
decisioned to learn back

if only on the way to the trash
