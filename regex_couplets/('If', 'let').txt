('if', 'let')

drifting away
But I can’t let myself treat 

drifting away needs others presume desires
If I let myself see others desires

at any time it can drift again
I let myself treat

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
But I can’t let myself disregard

if you have providence to excess
It’s the third letter from the end

That company creates a life
I let it remind me again

if there is anything
