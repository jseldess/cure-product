('if', 'line')

drifting away
on the time line I was on

if you have providence to excess
I spend time online learning to code

out of the fifth page ruins
On the timeline I was on

learned without too much difficulty to code
barely outlines

More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

if there is anything 
Choose a line

if only on the way to the trash
