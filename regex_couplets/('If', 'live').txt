('If', 'live')

If I step on the edge
Which is a measure to never live out

If I let myself see others desires
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

If he had not carried one virtue
Which is a pleasure to never live out

If you have confidence regardless all else
where I send and relive aside
