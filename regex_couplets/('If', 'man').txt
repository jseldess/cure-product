('if', 'man')

drifting away
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

if not directly on my skin
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

drifting does not feel an exception
To my children Walt Whitman

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Walt Whitman

For whom drifting is not an exception
What Whitman

What does it mean to drift
Walt Whitman drifted

drifting away needs
There are performance reviews

drifting away needs others presume desires
not many face up

If I take a different measure
though not many facts up in the sky

If I take some different measure
in not many tracks up in the sky

if there is anything 
They have very many choices

if that has anything
and that man comes on to tell me 

if only on the way to the trash
