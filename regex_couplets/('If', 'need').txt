('If', 'need')

If I step on the edge
and canâ€™t presume to need

If I let myself see others desires
drifting away needs others presume desires

If he had not carried one virtue
I need the work

If I take a different measure
I need an explicit statement

If I take some different measure
which I needed for an explicit state

If you have confidence regardless all else
You need history

If articles can storm in excess
And need out in front purchase
