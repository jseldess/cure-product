('If', 'night')

If I step on the edge
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

If I let myself see others desires
blue and sun again a second, then night

If I take a different measure
battery dawn nights blending themselves

If I take some different measure
dawn already formerly nights 

If you have confidence regardless all else
last night
