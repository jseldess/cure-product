('If', 'no')

If I step on the edge
or not even rotating

If I step over the edge
not even rotating

If I let myself see others desires
But not to impart cynicism

If he had not carried one virtue
which can be pronounced 

If you have confidence regardless all else
nor work in this way daily

If I take a different measure
I take it out in the snow fall

If I take some different measure
may not be ingrained

If articles can storm in excess
I used my technology
