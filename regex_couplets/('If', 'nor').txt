('if', 'nor')

drifting away
into the minority proportion of time

if not directly on my skin
over the long line I would honor

if you have providence to excess
nor work in this way daily

out of the fifth page ruins
the simple act of honoring an accountant

If I take a different measure
nor envy honest work

if you have providence
which had on honor to be told

if there is anything 
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

if only on the way to the trash
