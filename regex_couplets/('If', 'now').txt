('if', 'now')

drifting away
On a snow day with my children

if not directly on my skin
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

drifting does not feel an exception
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

drifting away needs
out in the snow

if you have providence to excess
out in the snow fall

That company creates a life
I take it out in the snow fall

If I take a different measure
I even know what I would find

If I take some different measure
even when close to my knowing

if there is anything 
knowing the constituents

if that has anything
who knows the way

if only on the way to the trash
