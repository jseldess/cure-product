('if', 'our')

drifting away
conversations with our purchase

if not directly on my skin
Of course there is a direction

drifting does not feel an exception
You can hear it also through your leisure

drifting away needs others presume desires
reasons resources

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
bring your child along

What does it mean to drift
Two hours and

out of the fifth page ruins
or an available resource

learned without too much difficulty to code
with four key value pairs

That company creates a life
or alter of course the time anyway

if there is anything 
This is your voice 

if you have providence
Who throws contours away

if only on the way to the trash
