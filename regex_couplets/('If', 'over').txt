('If', 'over')

If I step on the edge
If I step over the edge

If I let myself see others desires
over the long time up in the sky

If he had not carried one virtue
hovering above standing water

If I take a different measure
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

If you have confidence regardless all else
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
