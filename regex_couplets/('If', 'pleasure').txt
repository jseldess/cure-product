('if', 'pleasure')

drifting away
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

if not directly on my skin
Which is a pleasure to never live out

if you have providence to excess
there was no walking along the pleasure

If I take a different measure
up in the television pleasure

If I take some different measure
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

if there is anything
