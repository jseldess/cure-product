('if', 'pull')

drifting away
I’ll pull myself another personality type

drifting away needs
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

if you have providence to excess
fish pulled out of the lake

out of the fifth page ruins
I’ll pull myself higher up

learned without too much difficulty to code
