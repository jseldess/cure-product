('if', 'pure')

drifting away
as pure as my children

if not directly on my skin
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

drifting does not feel an exception
as a pure product

drifting away needs others presume desires
an impure product

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
as an impure product

at any time it can drift again
