('If', 'purpose')

If I step on the edge
by no ventillation my purpose

If he had not carried one virtue
until my purpose up in the sky

If I take a different measure
until I purpose the horizon

If I take some different measure
of my purpose in versing

If articles can storm in excess
Until my purpose 

If you have confidence regardless all else
I have entered my purposes
