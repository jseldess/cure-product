('If', 'resume')

If I step on the edge
and canâ€™t presume to need

If I let myself see others desires
drifting away needs others presume desires

If he had not carried one virtue
I resume unassimilable visions

If I take a different measure
I resume indelible tracks

If I take some different measure
I resume attributable visions

If you have confidence regardless all else
I continue to presume

If articles can storm in excess
I presume to others
