('if', 'ring')

drifting away
interferring 

drifting does not feel an exception
bring your child along

What does it mean to drift
ring

drifting away needs others presume desires
hovering above standing water

learned without too much difficulty to code
actually considering the end

If I take a different measure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

If I take some different measure
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

if there is anything 
firing and connecting somewhere

if that has anything
The prospect for veering healthily
