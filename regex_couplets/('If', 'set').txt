('if', 'set')

drifting away
upset by Gingrich

if you have providence to excess
in front of the set afternoon

That company creates a life
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

if there is anything 
Um, upset by Gingrich

if you have providence
presets

if only on the way to the trash
