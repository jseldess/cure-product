('if', 'side')

drifting away
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

if not directly on my skin
I’m simply inside

drifting does not feel an exception
aside from the retinas

That company creates a life
actually considering the end

If I take a different measure
But my not feeling the memory aside

if there is anything 
by the side of the hosting service

if only on the way to the trash
