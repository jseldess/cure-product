('If', 'sky')

If I step on the edge
over the long time up in the sky

If I let myself see others desires
over the long line up in the sky

If he had not carried one virtue
Blue sky or

If I take a different measure
though not many facts up in the sky

If I take some different measure
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

If you have confidence regardless all else
Up in the sky

If articles can storm in excess
My purpose up in the sky
