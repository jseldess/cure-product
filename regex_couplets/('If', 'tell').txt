('If', 'tell')

If I step on the edge
Then I constellate my time family country

If I let myself see others desires
So I constellate the time family country

If he had not carried one virtue
I constellate the time

If you have confidence regardless all else
The CEO tells me to embody values

If I take a different measure
I tell you my purposes
