('If', 'through')

If I step on the edge
You can hear it also through your leisure

If I let myself see others desires
Back up through the results

If I take a different measure
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

If I take some different measure
I cannot clear it also through investiture

If you have confidence regardless all else
I get through there

If articles can storm in excess
