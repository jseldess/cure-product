('if', 'time.')

drifting away
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

if not directly on my skin
only fragments of time with my children

drifting does not feel an exception
where I sleep at times

drifting away needs others presume desires
at any time it can drift again

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting is not an exception
over the long time up in the sky

drifting away needs
That’s where I sleep at times

drifting away from the task
So I constellate the time family country

if you have providence to excess
 and time in the train

out of the fifth page ruins
On the timeline I was on

learned without too much difficulty to code
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

That company creates a life
The long time I had a vision

If I take a different measure
without the long time I was accounting

If I take some different measure
The long time I was a vision

if there is anything 
Or alter of course the time anyway

if you have providence
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

if that has anything
formerly a long time they were on

if only on the way to the trash
