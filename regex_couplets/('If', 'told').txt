('if', 'told')

drifting away
I told her a story, she drew waves.

if not directly on my skin
I am told ventillation

if you have providence to excess
I am told by no ventillation

learned without too much difficulty to code
I am told by the ventillation

That company creates a life
which ran to be told

if there is anything
