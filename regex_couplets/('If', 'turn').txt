('if', 'turn')

drifting away
In a sharp downard turn

if not directly on my skin
in a sharp downward turn 

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
sudden downward turn

if you have providence to excess
I keep turning back again myself

out of the fifth page ruins
who knows how to turn it off

if only on the way to the trash
