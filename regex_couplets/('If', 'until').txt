('If', 'until')

If I step on the edge
until my purpose up in the sky

If he had not carried one virtue
until I could not tire 

If I take a different measure
until I could not be tired

If I take some different measure
until I could not be hired

If articles can storm in excess
until I purpose up in the sky

If you have confidence regardless all else
until a happier time found
