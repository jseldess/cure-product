('if', 'up?')

drifting away
asynchronous 

if not directly on my skin
Of course there is a direction

drifting does not feel an exception
The sun isn’t up

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to need others

at any time it can drift again
as a pure product

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting is not an exception
But not to impart cynicism

What does it mean to drift
Puffs of air

drifting away needs
There are quarterly goals

drifting away from the task
sudden downward turn

if you have providence to excess
which can be pronounced 

if he had not carried one virtue 
To neither study

out of the fifth page ruins
high up in the results

learned without too much difficulty to code
Having transitioned from leisure to work

That company creates a life
So stay with us

Life is with people
And as an extension of the values

If I take a different measure
in traversing my purchase

If I take some different measure
What I do in my liesure

if there is anything 
We had inhabited actually

if you have providence
which we can pronounce

if that has anything
without really needing

if only on the way to the trash
So I found myself at home
