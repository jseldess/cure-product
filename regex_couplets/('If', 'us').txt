('if', 'us')

drifting away
asynchronous 

if not directly on my skin
Theyâ€™re just not mine

drifting does not feel an exception
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

drifting away needs others presume desires
I want to cite a poem so usual

if you have providence to excess
was not just a defeat

out of the fifth page ruins
The ventillation rushes on

That company creates a life
So stay with us

Life is with people
but it continued rippling muscle

If I take a different measure
I reuse unassimilable visions

If I take some different measure
I reuse indelible tracks 

if there is anything 
trackers collecting data on users

if that has anything
in the form filled offered in trust

if only on the way to the trash
