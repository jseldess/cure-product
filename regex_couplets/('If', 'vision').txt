('If', 'vision')

If I step on the edge
I had me a vision

If I take a different measure
I reuse unassimilable visions

If I take some different measure
I resume unassimilable visions

If you have confidence regardless all else
The long time I had a vision

If articles can storm in excess
there wasnâ€™t any television
