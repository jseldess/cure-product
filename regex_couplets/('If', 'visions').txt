('If', 'visions')

If I step on the edge
The planning process for visions

If I take a different measure
I reuse unassimilable visions

If I take some different measure
I resume unassimilable visions

If you have confidence regardless all else
I resume attributable visions

If articles can storm in excess
visions that can be attainable
