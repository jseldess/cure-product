('if', 'walk')

drifting away
Before we walk across the wide field

if not directly on my skin
Before anyone walks across the opening

drifting does not feel an exception
there was no walking along the pleasure

If I take a different measure
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

If I take some different measure
walking into percents blending themselves

if there is anything
