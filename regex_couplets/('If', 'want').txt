('if', 'want')

drifting away
When I want something

if not directly on my skin
I want to find a way to block it incoming

drifting does not feel an exception
I want but not to impart cynicism

drifting away needs others presume desires
I want to cite a poem so usual

if you have providence to excess
I want to cite a poem

if he had not carried one virtue 
all that I can think I want

If I take a different measure
