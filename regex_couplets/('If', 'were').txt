('If', 'were')

If I step on the edge
When we had jobs that were to earn

If he had not carried one virtue
my desires were open

If I take a different measure
they were on

If I take some different measure
in the long time they were on

If articles can storm in excess
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

If you have confidence regardless all else
answered about
