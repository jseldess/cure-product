('if', 'When')

drifting away
When I woke up in the morning

if not directly on my skin
When I want something

drifting does not feel an exception
When we had jobs that were to earn

if you have providence to excess
When they really take hold of my finger

out of the fifth page ruins
When closed to my knowing

If I take some different measure
When I'm watching my tv 

if only on the way to the trash
