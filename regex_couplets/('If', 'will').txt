('if', 'will')

drifting away
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

drifting does not feel an exception
will not be the same

If I take a different measure
that will spur me on

If I take some different measure
would only willingly break

if there is anything 
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

if only on the way to the trash
