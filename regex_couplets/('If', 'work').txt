('if', 'work')

drifting away
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

if not directly on my skin
nor work in this way daily

out of the fifth page ruins
Having transitioned from leisure to work

That company creates a life
I need the work

If I take a different measure
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

If I take some different measure
nor envy honest work

if you have providence
