('If', 'world')

If I step on the edge
off the edge of the world

If I let myself see others desires
Which can be pronounced to the world

If he had not carried one virtue
The world 

If you have confidence regardless all else
off the end of the world

If I take a different measure
hauling off the end of the world

If I take some different measure
falling off the end of the world

If articles can storm in excess
the opinions in my world
