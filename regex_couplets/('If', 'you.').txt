('if', 'you.')

drifting away
Though how can you know without direction

drifting does not feel an exception
You can hear it also through your leisure

drifting away needs others presume desires
bring your child along

What does it mean to drift
if you have providence to excess

if he had not carried one virtue 
May I have your zip code

out of the fifth page ruins
That you can see only the back of

That company creates a life
since you can imagine movement

Life is with people
where you can earn more 

If I take a different measure
If you have confidence regardless all else

If I take some different measure
a futile joyous white sun

if there is anything 
This is your voice 

if you have providence
the young ripples inaudibly

if only on the way to the trash
