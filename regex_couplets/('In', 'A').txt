('In', 'A')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
All of the time

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
Actually one day there is direction

In the right sense
And as an extension of the values

Interrupted sleep or
A turtle fished out of the lake

In a continuous theme
And make myself a visible

In my sight 
As an extension of the values

In conversing of my purpose
As a clone, illegally conceived

In my heart did I lose trust
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
