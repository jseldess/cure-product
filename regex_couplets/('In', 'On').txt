('In', 'On')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
One day there is direction

In the right sense
One year or

Interrupted sleep or
On the bandwidth I was on

In a continuous theme
On the timeline I was on

In my sight 
On the other hand

In conversing of my purpose
One was up where it should be down

In my heart did I lose trust
