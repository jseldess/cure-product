('In', 'To')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
To my children Walt Whitman

In the right sense
To my chidren

Interrupted sleep or
To that impossible place

In my sight 
Tomorrow

In conversing of my purpose
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

In my heart did I lose trust
To the ends of transactions
