('In', 'Which')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Which is a measure to never live out

In the right sense
Which can be pronounced to the world

Interrupted sleep or
Which is a pleasure to never live out

In conversing of my purpose
Which can be called confidence

In my heart did I lose trust
