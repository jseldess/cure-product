('In', 'across')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Before we walk across the wide field

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
Before we walk across the wide opening

In the retroactive light
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

In the light of retroactive
Before anyone walks across the opening

In the right sense
across the retinas

In my sight 
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

In conversing of my purpose
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
