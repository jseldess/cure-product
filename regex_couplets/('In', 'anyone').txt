('In', 'anyone')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

In the light of retroactive
Before anyone buys up the opening

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
Before anyone walks across the opening

In the right sense
