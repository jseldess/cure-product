('In', 'but')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
but not impart cynicism

In the right sense
Attributable or

Interrupted sleep or
but the sun isnâ€™t up

In my sight 
but it continued rippling muscle

In conversing of my purpose
attributable visions

In my heart did I lose trust
that decisions can be attributable
