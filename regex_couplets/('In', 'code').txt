('In', 'code')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
as long as I have access to the code

In the right sense
May I have your zip code

In a vertiginous dream
I spend time online learning to code

In a continuous theme
learned without too much difficulty to code

In my sight 
falling off the encoded end

In conversing of my purpose
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

In my heart did I lose trust
zipcode
