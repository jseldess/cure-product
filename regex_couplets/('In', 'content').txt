('In', 'content')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
After having been contented

Interrupted sleep or
low in the content architecture

In a continuous theme
Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture

In my sight 
that having been after content

In conversing of my purpose
