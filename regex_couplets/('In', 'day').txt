('In', 'day')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
on a snow day with my children

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
One day there is direction

In the right sense
I argued the days felt longer

In my sight 
The days were long aligned

In conversing of my purpose
The day

In my heart did I lose trust
at least most days
