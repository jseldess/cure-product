('In', 'do')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
In a sharp downard turn

In the retroactive light
It keeps coming down thankfully

In the light of retroactive conversations
does not feel an exception

In the right sense
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Interrupted sleep or
I brought my head down

In a vertiginous dream
I brought my qualities down

In a continuous theme
I put my bread down

In my sight 
What I do in my liesure

In conversing of my purpose
here is the site of the battle of maldon

In my heart did I lose trust
and it doesnâ€™t take long
