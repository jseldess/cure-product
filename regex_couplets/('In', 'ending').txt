('In', 'ending')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
I tried to feel the key values extending 

In my sight 
talking into pheasants bending themselves

In conversing of my purpose
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

In my heart did I lose trust
battery dawn nights ending themselves
