('In', 'find')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
I want to find a way to block it incoming

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
I can find a way to block it incoming

In the right sense
Companies increasingly find 

In my sight 
I even know what I would find

In conversing of my purpose
So I find myself at home
