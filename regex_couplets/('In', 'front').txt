('In', 'front')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

In a continuous theme
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

In my sight 
And need out in front purchase

In my heart did I lose trust
behind or out front or up above
