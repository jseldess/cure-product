('In', 'he')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
Then fall then summer from my face

In the retroactive light
Face falling off the edge of the face

In the light of retroactive conversations
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

In the light of retroactive
Then fall then summer

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
Of course there is a direction

In the right sense
Without a head

Interrupted sleep or
 and time in the train

In a vertiginous dream
Then the sun isnâ€™t up

In a continuous theme
I put my head down

In my sight 
I had to tell them the news

In conversing of my purpose
I get through there

In my heart did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me
