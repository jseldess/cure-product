('In', 'head')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Without a head

Interrupted sleep or
I brought my head down

In a vertiginous dream
I search with my head

In a continuous theme
I put my head down

In my sight 
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

In my heart did I lose trust
