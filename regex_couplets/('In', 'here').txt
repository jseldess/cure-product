('In', 'here')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Of course there is a direction

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
One day there is direction

In the right sense
where I sleep at times

Interrupted sleep or
I’ll get there eventually

In a vertiginous dream
Where official policy is to catch and release

In a continuous theme
I’ll get there ruins

In my sight 
there was no promotion

In conversing of my purpose
I get through there

In my heart did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me
