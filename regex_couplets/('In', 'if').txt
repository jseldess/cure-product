('In', 'if')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
if not directly on my skin

In the right sense
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Interrupted sleep or
out of the fifth page ruins

In my sight 
That company creates a life

In conversing of my purpose
If I take a different measure

In my heart did I lose trust
if only on the way to the trash
