('In', 'know')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
who knows the way

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
how can I know without direction

In the right sense
I even know what I would find

In conversing of my purpose
even when close to my knowing

In my heart did I lose trust
who knows how to turn it off
