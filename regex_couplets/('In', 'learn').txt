('In', 'learn')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
in light of learning what we see

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
I spend time online learning to code

In a continuous theme
learned without too much difficulty to code

In my sight 
decisioned to learn 

In my heart did I lose trust
decisioned to learn back
