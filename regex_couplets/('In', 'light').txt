('In', 'light')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
variegated reflected light

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
In the retroactive light

In a sharp downard turn
In the light of retroactive conversations

In the light of retroactive
in light of learning what we see

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
stopped light with validated fields

In my heart did I lose trust
where lights blended themselves
