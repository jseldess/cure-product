('In', 'nor')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
into the minority proportion of time

In the right sense
over the long line I would honor

Interrupted sleep or
the simple act of honoring an accountant

In conversing of my purpose
nor work in this way daily

In my heart did I lose trust
