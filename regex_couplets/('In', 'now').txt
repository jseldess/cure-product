('In', 'now')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
on a snow day with my children

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

In the right sense
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

Interrupted sleep or
out in the snow

In my sight 
I take it out in the snow fall

In conversing of my purpose
even when close to my knowing

In my heart did I lose trust
who knows how to turn it off
