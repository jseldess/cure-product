('In', 'opening')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Before we walk across the wide opening

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

In the light of retroactive
Before anyone buys up the opening

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
Before anyone walks across the opening

In the right sense
The simple act opening surmounted

In conversing of my purpose
