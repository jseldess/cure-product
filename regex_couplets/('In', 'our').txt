('In', 'our')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
conversations with our purchase

In the light of retroactive
conversations with our reactions

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
Of course there is a direction

In the right sense
reasons resources

Interrupted sleep or
May I have your zip code

In a vertiginous dream
or an available resource

In my sight 
You can hear it also through your leisure

In conversing of my purpose
or alter of course the time anyway

In my heart did I lose trust
Who throws contours away
