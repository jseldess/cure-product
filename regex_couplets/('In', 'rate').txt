('IN', 'rate')

ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’
and my heart rate

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
Strategy comes before morning

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
Strategy comes before goals

ASPIRATING
and strategies not tactics

ASPIRATING VISIONS
I aspirate with little vision

FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS
