('In', 'reason')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
reasons resources

Interrupted sleep or
with little reason to move

In my sight 
with little reason to aspiration

In conversing of my purpose
More reasons around my country 

In my heart did I lose trust
and could be inflected with reasons
