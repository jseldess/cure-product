('In', 'reasons')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
reasons resources

Interrupted sleep or
with little reasons to aspiration

In my sight 
Toward the start informally given my reasons

In conversing of my purpose
More reasons around my country 

In my heart did I lose trust
and could be inflected with reasons
