('In', 'repeated')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
I reach repeated expressions first

In the retroactive light
I propogated repeated expressions first

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
burrowed about from repeated travels

In my heart did I lose trust
deep into pathways from repeated travels
