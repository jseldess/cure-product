('In', 'resume')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
and can’t presume to need

In the right sense
Then I can’t presume to need others

Interrupted sleep or
I resume unassimilable visions

In conversing of my purpose
I continue to presume

In my heart did I lose trust
I presume to others
