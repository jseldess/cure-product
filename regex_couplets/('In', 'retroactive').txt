('In', 'retroactive')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
In the retroactive light

In a sharp downard turn
of retroactive observations

In the light of retroactive conversations
In the light of retroactive

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
