('In', 'should')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
While I should be sleeping

In a vertiginous dream
Looking back while I should be sleeping

In a continuous theme
While I should sleep not back in the results

In my sight 
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

In my heart did I lose trust
