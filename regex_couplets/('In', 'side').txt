('IN', 'side')

ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’
aside from the retinas

FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS
But my not feeling the memory aside

By NATASHA SINGER
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
But my not feeling the memory inside

PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)
By my feeling the memory inside

PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR
44 seconds inside
