('In', 'tell')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Then I constellate my time family country

Interrupted sleep or
The CEO tells me to embody values

In a continuous theme
I had to tell them the news

In my sight 
So I constellate the time family country

In conversing of my purpose
I tell you my purposes

In my heart did I lose trust
