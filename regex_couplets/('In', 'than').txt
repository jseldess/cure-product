('In', 'than')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
It keeps coming down thankfully

In the light of retroactive conversations
than in the incoming stream

In the right sense
than solid ground

In conversing of my purpose
Having seen more than 

In my heart did I lose trust
Having seen more than I can remember
