('In', 'though')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
As though stationary and a destination

In the right sense
though it was most emphatically that

Interrupted sleep or
I had nightmares though

In my sight 
though not many freeze up

In conversing of my purpose
I thought

In my heart did I lose trust
though we are waiting for her
