('IN', 'time.')

ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’
So I constellate the time family country

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
over the long time I was on

THE PLANNING PROCESS
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

ASPIRATING
The long time I had a vision

FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS
or alter of course the time anyway

By NATASHA SINGER
until a happier time found

PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
formerly along time they were on

PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)
time they were on
