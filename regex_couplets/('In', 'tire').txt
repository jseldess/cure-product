('In', 'tire')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

In my sight 
until I could not tire 

In conversing of my purpose
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

In my heart did I lose trust
