('In', 'turn')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
In a sharp downard turn

In the retroactive light
in a sharp downward turn 

Interrupted sleep or
I keep turning back again myself

In a vertiginous dream
I keep turning back

In a continuous theme
who knows how to turn it off
