('IN', 'up?')

ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’
But in more 

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
Then I cannot see face value

THE PLANNING PROCESS
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
out in the snow

ASPIRATING
of my economic value

ASPIRATING VISIONS
And as an extension of the values

FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS
a futile joyous white sun

PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
though we are waiting for her

PRELUDE (IN A MINOR WITH A RUBBY DUCKY)
I end up in Bach 

PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)
But my not feeling the memory inside

PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR
I have turned it off
