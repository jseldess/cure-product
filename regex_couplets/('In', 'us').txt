('In', 'us')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

In the right sense
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Interrupted sleep or
In a vertiginous dream

In a continuous theme
in a continuous vertiginous dream

In my sight 
but it continued rippling muscle

In conversing of my purpose
a futile joyous white sun

In my heart did I lose trust
In what part did I lose trust
