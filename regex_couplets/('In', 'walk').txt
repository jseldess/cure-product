('In', 'walk')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Before we walk across the wide field

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
Before we walk across the wide opening

In the retroactive light
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

In the light of retroactive
Before anyone walks across the opening

In the right sense
there was no walking along the pleasure

In conversing of my purpose
