('IN', 'you.')

ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’
if you have providence to excess

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
That you can see only the back of

ASPIRATING VISIONS
since you can imagine movement

FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS
a futile joyous white sun

By NATASHA SINGER
the young ripples inaudibly
