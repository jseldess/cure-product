('It', 'come')

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

It keeps coming down thankfully
Strategy comes before morning

It’s morning 
Its strategy comes before morning goals

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
and that man comes on to tell me 

It’s not marshal exactly
and come home to remind inflections
