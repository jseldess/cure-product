('It', 'eat')

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
too sunny to eat ice cream

It keeps coming down thankfully
I reach repeated expressions first

It has been since
Then I can’t presume to treat others

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
of the habits I create

It’s not marshal exactly
for the creation of the universe
