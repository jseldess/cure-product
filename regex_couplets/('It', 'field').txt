('It', 'field')

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
Before we walk across the wide field

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
stopped light with validated variegated fields

It keeps coming down thankfully
Before anyone has walked across the field

It has been since
stopped light with validated fields

It’s not marshal exactly
