('It', 'now')

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
on a snow day with my children

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
who knows the way

It keeps coming down thankfully
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

It has been since
Right now I’m the cart

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
out in the snow

It’s morning 
out in the snow fall

It’s not marshal exactly
who knows how to turn it off

It’s not marshall exactly
who know the ways to their other end
