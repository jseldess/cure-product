('It', 'open')

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
Before we walk across the wide opening

It keeps coming down thankfully
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

It has been since
my desires were open

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
The simple act opening surmounted

It’s not marshal exactly
