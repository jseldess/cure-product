('It', 'rate')

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

It keeps coming down thankfully
and my heart rate

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
Strategy comes before morning

It’s morning 
Its strategy comes before morning goals

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
and strategies not tactics

It’s not marshal exactly
