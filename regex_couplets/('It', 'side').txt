('It', 'side')

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
I’m simply inside

It has been since
aside from the retinas

It’s not marshal exactly
But my not feeling the memory inside

It’s not marshall exactly
By my feeling the memory inside
