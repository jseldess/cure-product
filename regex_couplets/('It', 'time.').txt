('It', 'time.')

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
only fragments of time with my children

It has been since
where I sleep at times

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

It’s the third letter from the end
The long time I had a vision

It’s not marshal exactly
formerly along time they were on
