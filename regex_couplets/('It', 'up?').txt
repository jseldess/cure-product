('It', 'up?')

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

It keeps coming down thankfully
Then fall then summer

It has been since
But in more 

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
The ventillation rushes on

It’s morning 
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Its strategy comes before morning goals
but the sun isn’t up

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
I just got a letter

It’s the third letter from the end
I see only the back of falling values

It’s not marshal exactly
I end up Bach

It’s not marshall exactly
and stand and retrieve and pulse around
