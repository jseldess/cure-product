('It\xe2\x80\x99s', 'Why')

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

It’s the third letter from the end
