It’s time to wake up, Papa!
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

It’s morning 
What I do in my liesure

It’s not marshal exactly
and it doesn’t take long
