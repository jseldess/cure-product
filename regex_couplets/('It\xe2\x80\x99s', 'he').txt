('It\xe2\x80\x99s', 'he')

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
The ventillation rushes on

It’s morning 
but the sun isn’t up

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
It’s the third letter from the end

It’s not marshal exactly
the other end transactions

It’s not marshall exactly
the way that I was going
