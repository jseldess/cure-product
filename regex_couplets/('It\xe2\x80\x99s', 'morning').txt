('It\xe2\x80\x99s', 'morning')

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
When I woke up in the morning

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
Strategy comes before morning

It’s morning 
Its strategy comes before morning goals

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
