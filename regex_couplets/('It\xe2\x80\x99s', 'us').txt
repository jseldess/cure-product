('It\xe2\x80\x99s', 'us')

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
asynchronous 

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
The ventillation rushes on

It’s morning 
I just got a letter

It’s the third letter from the end
So stay with us

It’s not marshal exactly
radiating from housing
