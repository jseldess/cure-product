('My', 'do')

My live connections to you
The dogs and lillies

My associations
What I do in my liesure

My purpose up in the sky
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

My means without gravity
here is the site of the battle of maldon

My daughter with her way
and it doesn’t take long

My say to the elections
I only think I don’t listen
