('My', 'he')

My live connections to you
Where I sleep at times

My associations
or argued for them at least

My purpose up in the sky
under the grasp principle

My means without gravity
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

My daughter with her way
to the ends

My daughter helps too
Though we are waiting for her

My say to the elections
the right of my elections

My interesting politics
I stay the right of my elections

My state kept loaned impression
The weight kept moaned impression

My void
I have them lost
