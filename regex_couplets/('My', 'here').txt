('My', 'here')

My live connections to you
Where I sleep at times

My associations
There was very little physical activity

My purpose up in the sky
We had to say goodbye there

My means without gravity
here is the site of the battle of maldon

My daughter with her way
Is there a baby and a bear

My daughter helps too
There are constant ways

My say to the elections
my ethereal economic relations

My interesting politics
I learned the point where I am

My state kept loaned impression
where the tongue rippled

My void
The prospects there already
