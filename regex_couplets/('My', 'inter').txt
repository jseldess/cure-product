('My', 'inter')

My live connections to you
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

My associations
Then I saw them interview

My purpose up in the sky
my interfaced stand data

My say to the elections
 as points which are my interest 

My interesting politics
Aligned or not with my interests

My state kept loaned impression
