('My', 'know.')

My live connections to you
who knows the way

My associations
I even know what I would find

My purpose up in the sky
knowing the constituents

My daughter with her way
who knows how to turn it off

My daughter helps too
who know the ways to their other end

My say to the elections
that their knowing

My state kept loaned impression
