('My', 'side')

My live connections to you
Whereas direction is beside the point

My associations
aside from the retinas

My purpose up in the sky
But my not feeling the memory aside

My daughter with her way
But my not feeling the memory inside

My daughter helps too
By my feeling the memory inside

My say to the elections
