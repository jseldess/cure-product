('My', 'so')

My live connections to you
Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type

My associations
with little reason to move

My purpose up in the sky
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

My means without gravity
so that nothing had gravity

My daughter with her way
by in the sound privacy

My say to the elections
buy in the sound privacy
