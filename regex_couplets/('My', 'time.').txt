('My', 'time.')

My live connections to you
Where I sleep at times

My associations
The long time I had a vision

My purpose up in the sky
or alter of course the time anyway

My daughter with her way
formerly along time they were on

My say to the elections
in the long time they were on

My state kept loaned impression
