('My', 'up?')

My live connections to you
Suspended live in connections to you

My associations
or argued for them at least

My purpose up in the sky
Sweets and coffee and juice

My means without gravity
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

My daughter with her way
Though we are waiting for her

My daughter helps too
My daughter turns it off too

My say to the elections
about 

My interesting politics
which I feel formerly about for

My state kept loaned impression
my reflexing indented in my own tongue

My void
I have them trust in me
