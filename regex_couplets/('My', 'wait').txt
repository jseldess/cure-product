('My', 'wait')

My live connections to you
There are spots waiting

My means without gravity
Though we are waiting for her

My daughter with her way
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

My daughter helps too
not needing to wait

My say to the elections
waiting out front or up above 

My state kept loaned impression
