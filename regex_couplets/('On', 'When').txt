('On', 'When')

On a snow day with my children
When I woke up in the morning

One day there is direction
When we had jobs that were to earn

One year or
When they really take hold of my finger

On the bandwidth I was on
When closed to my knowing

One was up where it should be down
When I'm watching my tv
