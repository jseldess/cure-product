('On', 'code')

On a snow day with my children
as long as I have access to the code

One day there is direction
May I have your zip code

On the bandwidth I was on
learned without too much difficulty to code

On the other hand
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

One was up where it should be down
Is the weight of my click or zipcode
