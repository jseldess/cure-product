('On', 'eat')

On a snow day with my children
too sunny to eat ice cream

One day there is direction
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

One year or
Where I put it beating

On the bandwidth I was on
executive breath

On the other hand
it was not just a defeat

One was up where it should be down
was not just a defeat
