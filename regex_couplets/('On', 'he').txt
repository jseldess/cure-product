('On', 'he')

On a snow day with my children
Before we walk across the wide field

One day there is direction
Then fall then summer

On a day there will be direction
Though there are quarters goals

One year or
 and time in the train

On the bandwidth I was on
the dogs and lillies

On the timeline I was on
The timeline

On the other hand
I need the work

One was up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes
