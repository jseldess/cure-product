('On', 'inter')

On a snow day with my children
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

One day there is direction
interjecting on a day ambition

On a day there will be direction
way high up in the inter

One year or
hold at intervals riding forward

On the bandwidth I was on
at intervals while riding forward

On the timeline I was on
high up in the internet

On the other hand
Then I saw them interview

One was up where it should be down
my interfaced stand data
