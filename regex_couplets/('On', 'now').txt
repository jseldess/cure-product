('On', 'now')

On a snow day with my children
who knows the way

One day there is direction
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

On a day there will be direction
how can I know without direction

One year or
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

On the other hand
even when close to my knowing

One was up where it should be down
knowing the constituents
