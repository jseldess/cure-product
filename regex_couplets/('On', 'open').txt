('On', 'open')

On a snow day with my children
Before we walk across the wide opening

One day there is direction
Before anyone walks across the opening

On a day there will be direction
my desires were open

On the bandwidth I was on
I wish my desires were open

On the timeline I was on
The simple act opening surmounted

One was up where it should be down
