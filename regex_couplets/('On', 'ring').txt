('On', 'ring')

On a snow day with my children
interferring 

One day there is direction
bring your child along

One year or
hovering above standing water

On the timeline I was on
actually considering the end

On the other hand
the simple act of honoring an accountant

One was up where it should be down
firing and connecting somewhere
