('On', 'sleep.')

On a snow day with my children
where I sleep at times

One day there is direction
Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times

One year or
Interrupted sleep or

On the bandwidth I was on
While I should be sleeping 

On the timeline I was on
like flattening sleep 

One was up where it should be down
