('On', 'time.')

On a snow day with my children
Then I constellate my time family country

One day there is direction
only fragments of time with my children

On a day there will be direction
where I sleep at times

One year or
 and time in the train

On the bandwidth I was on
On the timeline I was on

On the other hand
The long time I had a vision

One was up where it should be down
or alter of course the time anyway
