('On', 'us')

On a snow day with my children
asynchronous 

One day there is direction
Theyâ€™re just not mine

One year or
In a vertiginous dream

On the bandwidth I was on
in a continuous vertiginous dream

On the timeline I was on
The ventillation rushes on

On the other hand
I want to cite a poem so usual

One was up where it should be down
a futile joyous white sun
