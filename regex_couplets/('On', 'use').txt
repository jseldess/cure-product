('On', 'use')

On a snow day with my children
because it was really dark

One day there is direction
You use the most essential parts

On the bandwidth I was on
I reuse unassimilable visions

On the other hand
I used my technology

One was up where it should be down
trackers collecting data on users

More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds
I send and retrieve aside the impuse
