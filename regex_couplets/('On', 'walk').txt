('On', 'walk')

On a snow day with my children
Before we walk across the wide field

One day there is direction
Before anyone walks across the opening

On a day there will be direction
there was no walking along the pleasure

On the other hand
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

One was up where it should be down
