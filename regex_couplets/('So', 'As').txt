('so', 'As')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
As though stationary and a destination

You can hear it also through your leisure
Assimilable or

A person from a distance
Aspirational strategy

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
As an extension of the values

embodied with little reason
As a clone, illegally conceived

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
