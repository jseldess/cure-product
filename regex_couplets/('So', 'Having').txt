('so', 'Having')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
Having been purchased out of you

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
Having seen more than 

so still watch them
Having seen more than I can remember 

and could be inflected with reasons
