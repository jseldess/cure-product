('so', 'It')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
It keeps coming down thankfully

When I want something
It has been since

soft paper
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
Its strategy comes before morning goals

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
It’s not marshal exactly

by in the sound privacy
