('so', 'Or')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
Or the company

dislocated and a person from a distance
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

so that nothing had gravity
Or alter of course the time anyway

I want to cite a poem so usual
Or can have seen offering possession

and could be inflected with reasons
