('So', 'THE')

So I presume the offers already
THE SNOW

The South Carolina primary 
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

So I constellate the time family country
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

So I am told by the ventillation
UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON

So stay with us
THE OFFERS

So I look up and don’t walk any
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

So I find myself at home
