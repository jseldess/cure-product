('so', 'That')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
That’s exaclty what I want for them

You can hear it also through your leisure
That’s where I sleep at times

reasons resources
That’s when they really take

or an available resource
That you can see only the back of

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
That company creates a life

with little reason to aspiration
That I captured an afterimage

so that nothing had gravity
That are my right to say

buy in the sound privacy
