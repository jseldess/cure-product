('So', 'There')

So I presume the offers already
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

The South Carolina primary 
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

So I constellate the time family country
There was very little physical activity

So stay with us
There are spots waiting

So I find myself at home
