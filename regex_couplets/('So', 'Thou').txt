('so', 'Thou')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Though there are quarters goals

You can hear it also through your leisure
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

If I take some different measure
Though in not many acts

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Though we are waiting for her

I want to cite a poem so usual
Though we are breaking 

and sound redundant
Though we are waiting 

so still watch them
Though we can’t help waiting

by in the sound privacy
