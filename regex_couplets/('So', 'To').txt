('So', 'To')

So I presume the offers already
To my children Walt Whitman

The South Carolina primary 
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

So I constellate the time family country
To neither study

Some disease effecting the tree out front
To that impossible place

So I was advised to back up
Tomorrow

So I am told by the ventillation
Toward the start informally given my reasons

So I work and donâ€™t look any
To substitute neither study

So I find myself at home
