('So', 'Which')

So I presume the offers already
Which is a measure to never live out

The South Carolina primary 
Which can be pronounced to the world

So I constellate the time family country
Which is a pleasure to never live out

Some disease effecting the tree out front
Which can be called confidence

So I find myself at home
