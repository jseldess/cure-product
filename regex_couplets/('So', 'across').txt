('So', 'across')

So I presume the offers already
Before we walk across the wide field

So I went back to sleep
Before we walk across the wide opening

The South Carolina primary 
across the retinas

So stay with us
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

So I look up and donâ€™t walk any
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
