('so', 'assume')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
I assumed it was visible

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
I assumed 

I want to cite a poem so usual
I assumed what I draw

by in the sound privacy
I assume the offers reliable

and could be inflected with reasons
I assume the offers revisitable
