('So', 'attributable')

So I presume the offers already
I resume attributable visions

So I constellate the time family country
attributable visions

The South Carolina primary
that decisions can be attributable

So I find myself at home
revisions that can be attributable

So I found myself at home
decisions that can be attributable
