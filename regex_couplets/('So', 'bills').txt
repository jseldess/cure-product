('So', 'bills')

So I presume the offers already
between bills and stuffed animals

So I went back to sleep
I hear it between bills and stuff

So I am told by the ventillation
I can hear it between bills and stuff

So I constellate the time family country
bills and stuffed animals

So I find myself at home
