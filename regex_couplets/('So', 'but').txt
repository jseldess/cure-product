('So', 'but')

So I presume the offers already
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

So I went back to sleep
but not impart cynicism

The South Carolina primary 
Attributable or

Some disease effecting the tree out front
but the sun isn’t up

So stay with us
but it continued rippling muscle

So I constellate the time family country
but where is it

So I find myself at home
revisions that can be attributable

So I found myself at home
but I own all that’s messageable
