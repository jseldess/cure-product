('so', 'buy')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Before anyone buys up the opening

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
We had to buy there

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
buy in the surrounded privacy

sizes track for asking sound
buy in the sound privacy

and could be inflected with reasons
