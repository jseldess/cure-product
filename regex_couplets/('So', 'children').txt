('So', 'children')

So I presume the offers already
On a snow day with my children

So I went back to sleep
my childrenâ€™s consumption

The South Carolina primary 
Even the children

So I constellate the time family country
my possession of my children

So I find myself at home
speech my possession of my children

So I found myself at home
