('so', 'directly')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
if not directly on my skin

When I want something
of not directly from my skin

You can hear it also through your leisure
But not to me directly

dislocated and a person from a distance
The sun high enough to enter directly 

Toward the start informally given my reasons
The sun high enough to strike directly

and could be inflected with reasons
