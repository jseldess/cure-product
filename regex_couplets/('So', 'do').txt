('So', 'do')

So I presume the offers already
in a sharp downward turn 

So I went back to sleep
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

The South Carolina primary 
to the down arrow

So I constellate the time family country
The dogs and lillies

Some disease effecting the tree out front
I brought my qualities down

So I was advised to back up
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

So stay with us
What I do in my liesure

So I look up and don’t walk any
So I work and don’t look any

So I find myself at home
I only think I don’t listen
