('so', 'eat')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
too sunny to eat ice cream

When I want something
I reach repeated expressions first

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
But I can’t let myself treat 

reasons resources
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

soft paper
Then I can’t presume to treat others

You can hear it also through your leisure
executive breath

solvents
was not just a defeat

A person from a distance
Where I put it beating

Even before the lesson starts
execute breath

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
of the habits I create

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
of the habits they create.

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
That company creates a life

with little reason to aspiration
it was not just a defeat

Toward the start informally given my reasons
And from that great distance

or in some imaginary elsewhere
for the creation of the universe

firing and connecting somewhere
burrowed about from repeated travels

also didn’t really move
