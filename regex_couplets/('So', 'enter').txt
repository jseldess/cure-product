('so', 'enter')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
I have entered my phone

When I want something
The sun high enough to enter directly 

Toward the start informally given my reasons
I enter the flattening mirror

If I take some different measure
I have entered my purposes

sound inundated for my own purchases
I had entered my phone

buy in the sound privacy
