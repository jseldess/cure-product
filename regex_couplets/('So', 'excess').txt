('so', 'excess')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
Did he carry one virtue to excess

reasons resources
if you have providence to excess

I want to cite a poem so usual
not one virtue to excess

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
to excess

A person from a distance
If articles can storm in excess

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
