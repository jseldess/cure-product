('So', 'front')

So I presume the offers already
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

The South Carolina primary 
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

Some disease effecting the tree out front
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

So stay with us
And need out in front purchase

So I constellate the time family country
behind or out front or up above

So I find myself at home
