('So', 'has')

So I presume the offers already
conversations with our purchase

The South Carolina primary 
It has been since

So I constellate the time family country
in traversing my purchase

So I look up and donâ€™t walk any
purchased out

So I find myself at home
phase decisioned by the prospect

So I found myself at home
converting sight into a purchase
