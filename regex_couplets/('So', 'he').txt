('so', 'he')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
off the edge of the world

reasons resources
where I sleep at times

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

When I want something
The sun isn’t up 

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
All of the time

You can hear it also through your leisure
The dogs and lillies

who are so fresh and agile
the drifting is not something special

soft paper
here described

solvents
Then I can’t presume to need others

I want to cite a poem so usual
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

with reasons
When we had jobs that were to earn

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
when we had jobs that was to churn some bread

A person from a distance
The CEO tells me to embody values

dislocated and a person from a distance
Spinning around the heart

Even before the lesson starts
Even before the skills aquired

or an available resource
I’ll get there eventually

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
but the sun isn’t up

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I tried to feel the key values extending 

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
there was no promotion

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
I agrued the days were longer

My associations
or argued for them at least

with little reason to move
across the retinas

with little reasons to aspiration
And as an extension of the values

with little reasons to move
The days were long aligned

with little reason to aspiration
As an extension of the values

embodied with little reason
that potential is there for you

If I take some different measure
talking into pheasants bending themselves

no solid ground to continue along
there was no walking along

than solid ground
because there was no solid ground to continue along

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
What was the last time

I cannot clear it also through investiture
up in the television pleasure

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I can hear them between bills and stuff

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in the simple act of reading

You can clear it also through static seizure
The simple act opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
You can hear it also through static leisure

You can clear it also through static leisure
The long time I had a vision

Toward the start informally given my reasons
the opacity given to them

More reasons 
but where is it

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
While we’re up in the sky 

so that nothing had gravity
without any further damage

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

More reasons around my country 
and elsewhere my memory of you

sound inundated for my own purchases
All parties would be held for my own purchases

and sound redundant
all parties would be held

firing and connecting somewhere
where I send and receive

for not paying sound overwhelmed
the resemblance

so still watch them
Where in me pre-worn

so still them
after though there’s no memory

so still washed
 them

by in the sound privacy
phrase them of my possessions

by in the sounded privacy
step in by the prospect

sizes track for asking sound
bought in the sounded privacy

sizes asking for tracking sound
bought in the surrounded privacy 

also didn’t really move
By my memory elsewhere

buy in the sound privacy
phrase them of our possessions

and could be inflected with reasons
stopping in the middle
