('So', 'head')

So I presume the offers already
Without a head

The South Carolina primary 
I brought my head down

Some disease effecting the tree out front
I search with my head

So I was advised to back up
into the next level head

So stay with us
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

So I find myself at home
