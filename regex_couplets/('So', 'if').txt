('So', 'if')

So I presume the offers already
drifting away

So I went back to sleep
if not directly on my skin

The South Carolina primary 
drifting away needs others presume desires

So I constellate the time family country
if you have providence to excess

Some disease effecting the tree out front
out of the fifth page ruins

So I am told by the ventillation
That company creates a life

So stay with us
Life is with people

So I look up and donâ€™t walk any
If I take a different measure

So I find myself at home
if only on the way to the trash

So I found myself at home
