('so', 'ink')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
ink

solvents
all that I can think I want

If I take some different measure
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
I only think I don’t listen

and could be inflected with reasons
