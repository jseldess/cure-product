('so', 'inter')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

When I want something
interjecting on a day ambition

You can hear it also through your leisure
way high up in the inter

reasons resources
hold at intervals riding forward

or an available resource
high up in the internet

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
with internally regulated climate

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
Then I saw them interview

If I take some different measure
my interfaced stand data

buy in the sound privacy
