('so', 'joy')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

When I want something
I was enjoying acting against myself

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
a futile joyous white sun

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

I want to cite a poem so usual
