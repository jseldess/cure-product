('So', 'just')

So I presume the offers already
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

The South Carolina primary 
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

So I constellate the time family country
was not just a defeat

Some disease effecting the tree out front
I just got a letter

So stay with us
it was not just a defeat

So I work and donâ€™t look any
