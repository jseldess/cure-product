('so', 'know.')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
who knows the way

When I want something
how can I know without direction

You can hear it also through your leisure
I even know what I would find

If I take some different measure
even when close to my knowing

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
knowing the constituents

for not paying sound overwhelmed
who knows how to turn it off

by in the sound privacy
that their knowing

buy in the sound privacy
