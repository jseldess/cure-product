('So', 'learning')

So I presume the offers already
in light of learning what we see

The South Carolina primary 
I spend time online learning to code

So I was advised to back up
Then I am learning to code

So I am told by the ventillation
I am learning to code

So that I donâ€™t notice I am the only one
phase decision for learning

So I find myself at home
for learning by the prospect

So I found myself at home
