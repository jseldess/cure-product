('So', 'live')

So I presume the offers already
Which is a measure to never live out

The South Carolina primary 
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

So I constellate the time family country
Which is a pleasure to never live out

Some disease effecting the tree out front
where I send and relive aside

So I find myself at home
