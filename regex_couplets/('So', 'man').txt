('so', 'man')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

You can hear it also through your leisure
To my children Walt Whitman

who are so fresh and agile
Walt Whitman drifted

reasons resources
There are performance reviews

soft paper
not many face up

If I take some different measure
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
in not many tracks up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Though in not many acts

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
They have very many choices

sound inundated for my own purchases
and that man comes on to tell me 

so still watch them
The many transparent pixel calls

by in the sound privacy
