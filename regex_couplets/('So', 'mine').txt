('so', 'mine')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
They’re just not mine

You can hear it also through your leisure
The third letter from the end is mine

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
The ads in mine

If I take some different measure
To the right of determined elections

buy in the sound privacy
