('So', 'nor')

So I presume the offers already
into the minority proportion of time

So I went back to sleep
over the long line I would honor

So I constellate the time family country
nor work in this way daily

The South Carolina primary 
nor envy honestly

Some disease effecting the tree out front
the simple act of honoring an accountant

So I look up and donâ€™t walk any
nor envy honest work

So I find myself at home
