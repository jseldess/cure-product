('so', 'now')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
On a snow day with my children

reasons resources
who knows the way

When I want something
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

You can hear it also through your leisure
Right now I’m the cart

soft paper
out in the snow

solvents
out in the snow fall

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I take it out in the snow fall

no solid ground to continue along
I even know what I would find

If I take some different measure
even when close to my knowing

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
knowing the constituents

for not paying sound overwhelmed
who knows how to turn it off

by in the sound privacy
that their knowing

buy in the sound privacy
