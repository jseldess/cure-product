('so', 'open')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Before we walk across the wide opening

When I want something
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

You can hear it also through your leisure
my desires were open

A person from a distance
I wish my desires were open

or an available resource
The simple act opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static seizure
The simple act of opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
in the simple act of opening a book

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
