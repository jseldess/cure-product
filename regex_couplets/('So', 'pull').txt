('So', 'pull')

So I presume the offers already
I’ll pull myself another personality type

So I went back to sleep
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

The South Carolina primary 
I’ll pull my data higher up

So I constellate the time family country
fish pulled out of the lake

So I was advised to back up
I’ll pull myself higher up

So I am told by the ventillation
