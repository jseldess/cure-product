('So', 'really')

So I presume the offers already
because it was really dark

So I went back to sleep
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

The South Carolina primary 
When they really take hold of my finger

So I was advised to back up
without really agreeing

So I constellate the time family country
without really speaking

So I find myself at home
