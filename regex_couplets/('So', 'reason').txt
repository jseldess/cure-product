('So', 'reason')

So I presume the offers already
reasons resources

So I went back to sleep
with reasons

The South Carolina primary 
with little reason to move

So stay with us
with little reason to aspiration

So I constellate the time family country
Toward the start informally given my reasons

So I work and donâ€™t look any
More reasons 

So I find myself at home
and could be inflected with reasons
