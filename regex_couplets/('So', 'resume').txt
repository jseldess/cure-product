('So', 'resume')

So I presume the offers already
and can’t presume to need

The South Carolina primary 
Then I can’t presume to need others

So I constellate the time family country
I resume unassimilable visions

So I look up and don’t walk any
I resume attributable visions

So I find myself at home
I presume the offers

So I found myself at home
So I resume the offers already

So I presume the offers
So I presume the offers at home already
