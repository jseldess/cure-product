('so', 'set')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
upset by Gingrich

I want to cite a poem so usual
in front of the set afternoon

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
in front of the set of regulations

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
Um, upset by Gingrich

More reasons around my country 
presets

and could be inflected with reasons
