('So', 'should')

So I presume the offers already
While I should be sleeping

Some disease effecting the tree out front
Looking back while I should be sleeping

So I was advised to back up
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

So I constellate the time family country
they should rise up

So I find myself at home
