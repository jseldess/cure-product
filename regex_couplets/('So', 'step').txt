('So', 'step')

So I presume the offers already
I step off the edge

So I went back to sleep
I step over the edge

The South Carolina primary 
What the next step

So stay with us
from which to step off

So I constellate the time family country
step in by the prospect

So I find myself at home
phase decision step in

So I found myself at home
stepping in the middle

So I resume the offers already
stepping off into the middle
