('So', 'still')

So I presume the offers already
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

So I went back to sleep
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

The South Carolina primary 
I love my daughter still

So I constellate the time family country
though we are still breaking in

So I find myself at home
