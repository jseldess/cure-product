('So', 'tell')

So I presume the offers already
Then I constellate my time family country

So I went back to sleep
So I constellate the time family country

The South Carolina primary 
I constellate the time

Some disease effecting the tree out front
The CEO tells me to embody values

So I was advised to back up
I had to tell them the news

So stay with us
I tell you my purposes

So I find myself at home
