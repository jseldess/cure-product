('So', 'though')

So I presume the offers already
As though stationary and a destination

The South Carolina primary 
though it was most emphatically that

Some disease effecting the tree out front
I had nightmares though

So stay with us
though not many freeze up

So I constellate the time family country
I thought

So I find myself at home
