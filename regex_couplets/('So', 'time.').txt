('so', 'time.')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Then I constellate my time family country

reasons resources
where I sleep at times

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
only fragments of time with my children

You can hear it also through your leisure
at any time it can drift again

who are so fresh and agile
over the long time up in the sky

soft paper
That’s where I sleep at times

solvents
So I constellate the time family country

with reasons
 and time in the train

A person from a distance
I spend time online learning to code

dislocated and a person from a distance
On the timeline I was on

or an available resource
on the time line I was on

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
The long time I had a vision

no solid ground to continue along
without the long time I was accounting

If I take some different measure
The long time I was a vision

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
or alter of course the time anyway

I want to cite a poem so usual
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

sound inundated for my own purchases
until a happier time found

so still watch them
formerly along time they were on

by in the sound privacy
time they were on

by in the sounded privacy
in the long time they were on

buy in the sound privacy
