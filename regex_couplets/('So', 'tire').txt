('so', 'tire')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
The entire company

My associations
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

with little reason to move
until I could not tire 

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
until I could not be tired

You can hear it also through your leisure
for to tire as far back as my history

If I take some different measure
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
