('So', 'told')

So I presume the offers already
I told her a story, she drew waves.

So I went back to sleep
I am told ventillation

So I constellate the time family country
I am told by no ventillation

So I am told by the ventillation
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
which ran to be told

So I find myself at home
