('so', 'too')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
too sunny to eat ice cream

When I want something
emerging this year from too much standing water

or an available resource
learned without too much difficulty to code

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
Selma knows too 

by in the sound privacy
