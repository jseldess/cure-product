('so', 'turn')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
in a sharp downward turn 

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
In a sharp downard turn

When I want something
sudden downward turn

You can hear it also through your leisure
I keep turning back again myself

A person from a distance
I keep turning back

or an available resource
who knows how to turn it off

by in the sound privacy
I turn not sad exactly

buy in the sound privacy
