('so', 'up?')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I’ll get there eventually

reasons resources
in a sharp downward turn 

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

When I want something
The sun isn’t up 

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

You can hear it also through your leisure
Which is a measure to never live out

who are so fresh and agile
Puffs of air

soft paper
But in more 

solvents
Then I can’t presume to need others

I want to cite a poem so usual
Which is a pleasure to never live out

with reasons
not one virtue to excess

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
when we had jobs that was to churn some bread

A person from a distance
The CEO tells me to embody values

dislocated and a person from a distance
Spinning around the heart

Even before the lesson starts
Even before the skills aquired

or an available resource
high up in the internet

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
but the sun isn’t up

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
and key value

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
And as an extension of the values

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
I agrued the days were longer

My associations
or argued for them at least

with little reason to move
I argued that the days were longer

with little reasons to aspiration
with full potential to movement

with little reasons to move
full of aspirations

with little reason to aspiration
full of potential

embodied with little reason
As an extension of the values

If I take some different measure
What I do in my liesure

no solid ground to continue along
where you can earn more 

than solid ground
because there was no solid ground to continue along

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
I refuse indelible tracts

I cannot clear it also through investiture
up in the television pleasure

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I resume indelible tracks

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
black spots on a white surface

You can clear it also through static seizure
The simple act opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
You can clear it also through static siezure

You can hear it also through static leisure
You can clear it also through static leisure

Toward the start informally given my reasons
around my country 

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
While we’re up in the sky 

so that nothing had gravity
My means without gravity

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
I shivered looking up

More reasons around my country 
I have entered my purposes

sound inundated for my own purchases
All parties would be held for my own purchases

and sound redundant
for my own purchases

firing and connecting somewhere
for the duration of answers

for not paying sound overwhelmed
ground for not paying

so still watch them
still carefully

so still them
after though there’s no memory

so still washed
in the form filled offered must

by in the sound privacy
by in the sounded privacy

sizes track for asking sound
sizes asking for tracking sound

bought in the sounded privacy
between tracked and buffered

also didn’t really move
my daughter’s squirrel and chickadee joined me

buy in the sound privacy
phrase them of our possessions

and could be inflected with reasons
decisions that can be attributable
