('so', 'us')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
asynchronous 

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

When I want something
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

You can hear it also through your leisure
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

soft paper
I want to cite a poem so usual

solvents
was not just a defeat

A person from a distance
You use the most essential parts

Even before the lesson starts
in a continuous vertiginous dream

or an available resource
The ventillation rushes on

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
I just got a letter

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
So stay with us

with little reason to aspiration
but it continued rippling muscle

with little reason to move
I reuse unassimilable visions

no solid ground to continue along
because there was no solid ground to continue along

If I take some different measure
I reuse indelible tracks 

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
I refuse indelible tracts

I cannot clear it also through investiture
it was not just a defeat

Toward the start informally given my reasons
I have them trust in me

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I wear suspenders

so that nothing had gravity
a futile joyous white sun

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

reasons resources
trackers collecting data on users

sound inundated for my own purchases
in the form filled offered in trust

and sound redundant
useless for not having paid

so still watch them
in the form filled offered trust

so still them
in the form filled offered must

by in the sound privacy
radiating from housing

buy in the sound privacy
