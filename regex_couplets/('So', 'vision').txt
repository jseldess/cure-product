('So', 'vision')

So I presume the offers already
I had me a vision

So I am told by the ventillation
The planning process for visions

So stay with us
aspirating with little visions

So I constellate the time family country
The long time I had a vision

The South Carolina primary
there wasnâ€™t any television 

So I find myself at home
visions that can be attainable

So I found myself at home
revisions that can be attributable

So I resume the offers already
at home visions can be attainable

So I presume the offers
