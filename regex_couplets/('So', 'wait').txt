('so', 'wait')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
There are spots waiting

or in some imaginary elsewhere
Though we are waiting for her

I want to cite a poem so usual
not needing to wait

firing and connecting somewhere
Though we are waiting 

so still watch them
Though we can’t help waiting

by in the sound privacy
waiting out front or up above 

buy in the sound privacy
