('so', 'walk')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Before we walk across the wide field

reasons resources
Before we walk across the wide opening

When I want something
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

You can hear it also through your leisure
there was no walking along the pleasure

no solid ground to continue along
there was no walking along

than solid ground
walking along the measure

If I take some different measure
I walk up and don’t work anymore

Toward the start informally given my reasons
walking into percents blending themselves

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
