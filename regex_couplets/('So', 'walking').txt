('so', 'walking')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
there was no walking along the pleasure

no solid ground to continue along
there was no walking along

than solid ground
walking along the measure

If I take some different measure
walking into percents blending themselves

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
