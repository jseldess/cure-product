('so', 'you.')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
Though how can you know without direction

You can hear it also through your leisure
bring your child along

who are so fresh and agile
if you have providence to excess

I want to cite a poem so usual
If you have confidence regardless all else

A person from a distance
That you can see only the back of

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
since you can imagine movement

with little reason to move
where you can earn more 

than solid ground
you need history

If I take some different measure
a futile joyous white sun

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I tell you my purposes

so that nothing had gravity
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
This is your voice 

More reasons around my country 
This is your chance

sound inundated for my own purchases
the young ripples inaudibly

buy in the sound privacy
