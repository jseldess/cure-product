('THE', 'code')

THE SNOW
May I have your zip code

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
learned without too much difficulty to code

THE PLANNING PROCESS
Then I am learning to code

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
falling off the encoded end

THE OFFERS
encoded off the end

FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS
I click my zipcode up where it should be down
