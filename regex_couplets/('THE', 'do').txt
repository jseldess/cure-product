('THE', 'do')

THE SNOW
in a sharp downward turn 

ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’
I brought my head down

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
What I do in my liesure

THE OFFERS
I walk up and don’t work anymore

FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS
here is the site of the battle of maldon
