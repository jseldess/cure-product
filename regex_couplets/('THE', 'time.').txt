('THE', 'time.')

THE SNOW
over the long time up in the sky

ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’
So I constellate the time family country

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
over the long time I was on

THE PLANNING PROCESS
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

THE OFFERS
The long time I had a vision

FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS
or alter of course the time anyway
