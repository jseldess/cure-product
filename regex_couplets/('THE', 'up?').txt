('THE', 'up?')

THE SNOW
Then I cannot see face value

ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’
But in more 

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

THE PLANNING PROCESS
The ventillation rushes on

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
out in the snow

THE OFFERS
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS
a futile joyous white sun
