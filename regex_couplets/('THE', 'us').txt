('THE', 'us')

THE SNOW
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’
was not just a defeat

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
The ventillation rushes on

UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON
I just got a letter

THE OFFERS
I reuse indelible tracks 

FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS
a futile joyous white sun
