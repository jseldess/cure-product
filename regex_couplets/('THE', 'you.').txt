('THE', 'you.')

THE SNOW
You can hear it also through your leisure

ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’
if you have providence to excess

UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON
That you can see only the back of

THE OFFERS
If you have confidence regardless all else

FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS
a futile joyous white sun
