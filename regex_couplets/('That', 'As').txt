('That', 'As')

That’s exaclty what I want for them
As though stationary and a destination

That’s where I sleep at times
Assimilable or

That’s when they really take
Aspirational strategy

That you can see only the back of
As an extension of the values

That company creates a life
As a clone, illegally conceived

That I captured an afterimage
