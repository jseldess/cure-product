('That', 'Thou')

That’s exaclty what I want for them
Though there are quarters goals

That is itself not still
Though how can you know without direction

That’s where I sleep at times
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

That I captured an afterimage
Though we are waiting for her

That are my right to say
