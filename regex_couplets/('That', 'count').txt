('That', 'count')

That’s exaclty what I want for them
Then I constellate my time family country

That’s where I sleep at times
So I constellate the time family country

That’s when they really take
I brought my count down

That you can see only the back of
without the long time I was accounting

That I captured an afterimage
More reasons around my country 

That are my right to say
