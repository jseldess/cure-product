('That', 'earn')

That’s exaclty what I want for them
When we had jobs that were to earn

That’s when they really take
learned without too much difficulty to code

That you can see only the back of
where you can earn more 

That I captured an afterimage
decisioned to learn 

That are my right to say
I learned my location
