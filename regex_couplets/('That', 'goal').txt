('That', 'goal')

That’s exaclty what I want for them
Though there are quarters goals

That is itself not still
We can wrestle them with their goals

That’s where I sleep at times
before morning goals

That you can see only the back of
Not goals or tactics

That company creates a life
What would I feel without that goal

That I captured an afterimage
