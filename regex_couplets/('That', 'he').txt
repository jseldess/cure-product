('That', 'he')

That’s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field

That is itself not still
The edge isn’t even there

That’s where I sleep at times
to the pillow

That’s when they really take
with my head

That you can see only the back of
What the next step

That can’t be glimpsed
in front of the set afternoon

That company creates a life
And as an extension of the values

That I captured an afterimage
without any further damage

That are my right to say
the right of my elections
