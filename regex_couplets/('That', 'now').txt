('That', 'now')

That’s exaclty what I want for them
on a snow day with my children

That is itself not still
Though how can you know without direction

That’s where I sleep at times
Right now I’m the cart

That’s when they really take
out in the snow

That you can see only the back of
I take it out in the snow fall

That I captured an afterimage
knowing the constituents

That are my right to say
that their knowing
