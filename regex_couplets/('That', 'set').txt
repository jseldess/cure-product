('That', 'set')

That’s exaclty what I want for them
upset by Gingrich

That’s when they really take
in front of the set afternoon

That you can see only the back of
in front of the set of regulations

That company creates a life
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

That are my right to say
presets
