('That', 'time.')

That’s exaclty what I want for them
only fragments of time with my children

That is itself not still
where I sleep at times

That’s where I sleep at times
over the long time up in the sky

That’s when they really take
On the timeline I was on

That you can see only the back of
The long time I had a vision

That I captured an afterimage
or alter of course the time anyway

That are my right to say
in the long time they were on
