('That', 'tire')

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

That company creates a life
until I could not tire 

That I captured an afterimage
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

That are my right to say
