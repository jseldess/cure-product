('That', 'up?')

That’s exaclty what I want for them
The sun isn’t up 

That is itself not still
As though stationary and a destination

That’s where I sleep at times
sudden downward turn

That’s when they really take
Looking back while I should be sleeping

That you can see only the back of
an upsent afternoon

That can’t be glimpsed
their economic value

That company creates a life
So stay with us

That I captured an afterimage
without consumer damage

That are my right to say
about
