('That', 'us')

That’s exaclty what I want for them
They’re just not mine

That is itself not still
russling to stay still

That’s where I sleep at times
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

That’s when they really take
in a continuous vertiginous dream

That you can see only the back of
So stay with us

That company creates a life
but it continued rippling muscle

That I captured an afterimage
a futile joyous white sun

That are my right to say
I have them trust in me
