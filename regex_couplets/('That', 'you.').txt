('That', 'you.')

That’s exaclty what I want for them
Though how can you know without direction

That’s where I sleep at times
You can hear it also through your leisure

That’s when they really take
That you can see only the back of

That can’t be glimpsed
your bid to the next highest ranked network

That company creates a life
since you can imagine movement

That I captured an afterimage
a futile joyous white sun

That are my right to say
the young ripples inaudibly
