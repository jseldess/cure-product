('Thou', 'bill')

Though there are quarters goals
I hear it between bills and stuff

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I can hear it between bills and stuff

Though in not many acts
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

Though in not many facts
between bills and stuffed animals

Though we are waiting for her
the bill my detuning
