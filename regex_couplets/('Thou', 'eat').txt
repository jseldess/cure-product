('Thou', 'eat')

Though there are quarters goals
But I can’t let myself treat 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
it was not just a defeat

Though we are waiting for her
was not just a defeat

Though we are breaking 
for the creation of the universe

Though we are waiting 
burrowed about from repeated travels
