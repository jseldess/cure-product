('Thou', 'know.')

Though there are quarters goals
how can I know without direction

Though how can you know without direction
for how can you know without direction

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I even know what I would find

Though in not many acts
even when close to my knowing

Though we are waiting for her
knowing the constituents

Though we are waiting 
who knows the way

Though we can’t help waiting
who know the ways to their other end
