('Thou', 'literal')

Though there are quarters goals
and literally moved

Though we are waiting for her
as it was designed literally

Though we are breaking 
and literally unproved

Though we are waiting 
I literally moved

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
literally moved

Though we can’t help waiting
not literally moved about
