('Thou', 'man')

Though there are quarters goals
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
not many face up

Though in not many acts
Though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts
Though it is not many simple acts

Though it is not a simple act
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

Though we are waiting for her
They have very many choices

Though we are breaking 
and that man comes on to tell me 

Though we can’t help waiting
The many transparent pixel calls
