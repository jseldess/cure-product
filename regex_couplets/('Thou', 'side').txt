('Thou', 'side')

Though there are quarters goals
aside from the retinas

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
actually considering the end

Though in not many acts
But my not feeling the memory aside

Though we are waiting for her
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

Though we are breaking 
where I send and relive aside

Though we are waiting 
by the side of the hosting service

Though we can’t help waiting
But my not feeling the memory inside
