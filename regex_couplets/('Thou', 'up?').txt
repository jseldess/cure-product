('Thou', 'up?')

Though there are quarters goals
They’re just not mine

Though how can you know without direction
though there are quarters with goals

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
If I take a different measure

Though in not many acts
Though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts
Though it is not many simple acts

Though it is not a simple act
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Though we are waiting for her
I thought

Though we are breaking 
and literally unproved

Though we are waiting 
all parties would be held

Though we can’t help waiting
Though we can’t help waiting for her
