('Though', 'A')

Though there are quarters goals
Actually one day there is direction

Though how can you know without direction
And as an extension of the values

Though in not many acts
A defeated

Though we are waiting for her
And we could inhabit the room easy

Though we are breaking 
All parties would be held

Though we are waiting 
CONTRACT

Though we canâ€™t help waiting
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR
