('though', 'For')

As though stationary and a destination
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

though it was most emphatically that
Forecasting the story before dawn

I had nightmares though
For an ungraspable time

I thought
For Mitt Romney

though we are still breaking in
For my own purchases

after though there’s no memory
Formerly a way like this one

I answered what I thought
For a while I think I don’t listen
