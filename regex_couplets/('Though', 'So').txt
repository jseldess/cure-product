('though', 'so')

As though stationary and a destination
You can hear it also through your leisure

though it was most emphatically that
with reasons

I had nightmares though
with little reason to move

though not many freeze up
If I take some different measure

though not many facts up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

though as for conversing
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

though in not many acts up in the sky
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

though it is not a simple act
You can clear it also through static seizure

I thought
I want to cite a poem so usual

though we are still breaking in
sound inundated for my own purchases

after though thereâ€™s no memory
so still washed

though we are waiting for her
by in the sound privacy

I answered what I thought
by in the sounded privacy

I answered what I thought about
buy in the sound privacy
