('though', 'Thou')

As though stationary and a destination
Though there are quarters goals

though there are quarters with goals
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

though not many freeze up
Though in not many acts

though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

though it is not a simple act
Though we are waiting for her

I thought
Though we are breaking 

after though there’s no memory
Though we can’t help waiting

I answered what I thought
