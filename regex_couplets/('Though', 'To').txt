('though', 'To')

As though stationary and a destination
To my children Walt Whitman

though it was most emphatically that
To neither study

I had nightmares though
Tomorrow

though not many freeze up
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

I thought
To substitute neither study

though we are still breaking in
To the ends of transactions

though we are waiting for her
To the ends of my transactions

I answered what I thought
To the right of determined elections
