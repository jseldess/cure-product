('though', 'We')

As though stationary and a destination
We can wrestle them with their goals

though there are quarters with goals
We had to say goodbye there

I thought
We had inhabited actually

though it was most emphatically that
We got paid one way by a voice

though we are still breaking in
We ask say in that case
