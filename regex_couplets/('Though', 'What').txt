('though', 'what')

As though stationary and a destination
what I find there

though it was most emphatically that
I invited most of what came next

I had nightmares though
I even know what I would find

though not many freeze up
what literally moved

after though thereâ€™s no memory
In what part did I lose trust

though we are waiting for her
I answered what I thought

I thought
I assumed what I draw

I answered what I thought about
to return what I bought
