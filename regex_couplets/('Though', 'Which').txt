('though', 'Which')

As though stationary and a destination
Which is a measure to never live out

though it was most emphatically that
Which can be pronounced to the world

I had nightmares though
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I thought
Which can be called confidence

though we are still breaking in
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

after though thereâ€™s no memory
