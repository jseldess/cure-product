('Though', 'agreed')

Though there are quarters goals
and to which I’ve agreed

Though we are waiting for her
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

Though we are breaking 
and for which the plan agreed

Though we are waiting 
that agreed one of rest

Though we can’t help waiting
that agreed home
