('though', 'any')

As though stationary and a destination
at any time it can drift again

though it was most emphatically that
Or the company

I had nightmares though
The days aligned for company

though not many freeze up
though not many face up

though not many facts up in the sky
in not many tracks up in the sky

though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

though it is not a simple act
I walk up and don’t work anymore

I thought
Or alter of course the time anyway

though we are still breaking in
latency which doesn’t mean anything

after though there’s no memory
The many transparent pixel calls

I answered what I thought
or imagined anyway
