('though', 'count')

As though stationary and a destination
Then I constellate my time family country

though it was most emphatically that
I brought my count down

I had nightmares though
without the long time I was accounting

though not many freeze up
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I thought
So I constellate the time family country

though we are still breaking in
