('though', 'decision')

As though stationary and a destination
the planning process for decisions

I had nightmares though
attributable decisions

I thought
forgetting decisions 

after though thereâ€™s no memory
decisioned to learn 

though we are waiting for her
decisioned to learn back

I answered what I thought
decisions that can be attributable
