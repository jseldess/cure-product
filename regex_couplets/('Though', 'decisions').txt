('though', 'decisions')

As though stationary and a destination
the planning process for decisions

I had nightmares though
attributable decisions

I thought
forgetting decisions 

after though thereâ€™s no memory
that decisions can be attributable

though we are waiting for her
decisions that can be attributable
