('though', 'do')

As though stationary and a destination
does not feel an exception

though it was most emphatically that
I brought my head down

I had nightmares though
What I do in my liesure

though not many freeze up
I walk up and don’t work anymore

I thought
and it doesn’t take long

after though there’s no memory
I only think I don’t listen
