('though', 'earn')

As though stationary and a destination
When we had jobs that were to earn

I had nightmares though
where you can earn more 

though not many freeze up
decisioned to learn 

I thought
decisioned to learn back

though we are waiting for her
phase decision for learning

I answered what I thought
I learned my location
