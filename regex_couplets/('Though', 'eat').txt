('though', 'eat')

As though stationary and a destination
But I can’t let myself treat 

though it was most emphatically that
was not just a defeat

I had nightmares though
That company creates a life

though not many freeze up
it was not just a defeat

I thought
for the creation of the universe

after though there’s no memory
burrowed about from repeated travels

I answered what I thought
