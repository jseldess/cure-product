('though', 'else')

As though stationary and a destination
If you have confidence regardless all else

I had nightmares though
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I thought
and elsewhere my memory

though it was most emphatically that
and elsewhere my memory of you

though we are still breaking in
elsewhere by my memory

after though thereâ€™s no memory
By my memory elsewhere

I answered what I thought
but for memory elsewhere

I answered what I thought about
