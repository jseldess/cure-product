('though', 'enter')

As though stationary and a destination
The sun high enough to enter directly 

though it was most emphatically that
I enter the flattening mirror

I thought
I have entered my purposes

though we are still breaking in
I have entered my phone

after though thereâ€™s no memory
I had entered my phone

I answered what I thought
