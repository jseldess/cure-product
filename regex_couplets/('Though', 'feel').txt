('Though', 'feel')

Though there are quarters goals
does not feel an exception

Though in not many acts
But my not feeling the memory aside

Though we are waiting for her
But my not feeling the memory inside

Though we are waiting 
which feels most comfortable

Though we canâ€™t help waiting
By my feeling the memory inside
