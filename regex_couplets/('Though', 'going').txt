('Though', 'going')

Though there are quarters goals
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

Though in not many acts
The way that she is going

Though we are breaking 
The way that I am going

Though we are waiting for her
The way that I was going

Though we can’t help waiting
way I was going
