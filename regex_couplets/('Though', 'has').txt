('though', 'has')

As though stationary and a destination
It has been since

though it was most emphatically that
in traversing my purchase

though not many freeze up
purchased out

I thought
if that has anything

though we are still breaking in
for my own purchases

though we are breaking in the space that it had
found dated for my own purchases

after though thereâ€™s no memory
phase decisioned by the prospect

though we are waiting for her
He has turned it off

I answered what I thought
phase decisioned

I answered what I thought about
at the site of a purchase
