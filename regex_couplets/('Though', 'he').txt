('though', 'he')

As though stationary and a destination
The edge isn’t even there

And put in place as though stationary
I step off the edge

though there are quarters with goals
They’re just not mine

though it was most emphatically that
I constellate the time

I had nightmares though
that I was the arm of this

though not many freeze up
up in the television pleasure

though not many facts up in the sky
talking into pheasants bending themselves

though as for conversing
up in the television

though in not many acts up in the sky
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

though it is not a simple act
The simple act opening surmounted

I thought
to the ends of my transactions

though we are still breaking in
Though we are waiting for her

though we are breaking in the space that it had
where I send and relive would be held

after though there’s no memory
so still washed

I answered what I thought
formerly my way to the elections

I answered what I thought about
battery dawn nights ending themselves
