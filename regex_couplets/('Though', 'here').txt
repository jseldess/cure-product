('though', 'here')

As though stationary and a destination
The edge isn’t even there

And put in place as though stationary
Though there are quarters goals

though there are quarters with goals
with goals I find there

though it was most emphatically that
I’ll get there eventually

I had nightmares though
There was very little physical activity

though not many freeze up
there was no television to hear

though in not many acts up in the sky
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I thought
Where in me did I host

though we are still breaking in
where I send and relive would be held

after though there’s no memory
Where in me did I loose

though we are waiting for her
Is there a baby and a bear

I answered what I thought
where rights ended themselves

I answered what I thought about
where lights blended themselves
