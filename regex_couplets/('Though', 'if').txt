('though', 'if')

As though stationary and a destination
drifting does not feel an exception

though it was most emphatically that
if you have providence to excess

I had nightmares though
That company creates a life

though not many freeze up
If I take a different measure

though not many facts up in the sky
If I take some different measure

though in not many acts up in the sky
if there is anything 

I thought
if that has anything

after though thereâ€™s no memory
if only on the way to the trash
