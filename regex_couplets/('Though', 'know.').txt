('though', 'know.')

As though stationary and a destination
Though how can you know without direction

though there are quarters with goals
for how can you know without direction

though it was most emphatically that
I even know what I would find

though not many freeze up
even when close to my knowing

I thought
knowing the constituents

after though thereâ€™s no memory
who knows how to turn it off

I answered what I thought
who knows the way

I answered what I thought about
that their knowing
