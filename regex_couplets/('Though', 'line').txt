('though', 'line')

As though stationary and a destination
on the time line I was on

though it was most emphatically that
I spend time online learning to code

I had nightmares though
The days lined along company

though not many freeze up
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

I thought
Choose a line
