('Though', 'live')

Though there are quarters goals
Which is a measure to never live out

Though in not many acts
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Though we are waiting for her
Which is a pleasure to never live out

Though we are breaking 
where I send and relive aside

Though we are waiting 
where I send and relive
