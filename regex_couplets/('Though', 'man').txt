('though', 'man')

As though stationary and a destination
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

though it was most emphatically that
not many face up

though not many freeze up
though not many face up

though not many facts up in the sky
in not many tracks up in the sky

though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

though it is not a simple act
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

I thought
They have very many choices

though we are still breaking in
and that man comes on to tell me 

after though thereâ€™s no memory
The many transparent pixel calls

I answered what I thought
