('though', 'many')

As though stationary and a destination
not many face up

though not many freeze up
though not many face up

though not many facts up in the sky
in not many tracks up in the sky

though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

though it is not a simple act
They have very many choices

I thought
The many transparent pixel calls

I answered what I thought
