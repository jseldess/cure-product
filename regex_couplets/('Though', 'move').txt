('though', 'move')

As though stationary and a destination
since I can imagine movement

I had nightmares though
with full potential to movement

though not many freeze up
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

I thought
and literally moved

though it was most emphatically that
myself moved literally as it is

after though thereâ€™s no memory
not literally moved about

I answered what I thought
not literally moved
