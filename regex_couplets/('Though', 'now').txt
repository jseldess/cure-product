('though', 'now')

As though stationary and a destination
Though how can you know without direction

though there are quarters with goals
for how can you know without direction

though it was most emphatically that
Right now I’m the cart

I had nightmares though
I take it out in the snow fall

though not many freeze up
even when close to my knowing

I thought
knowing the constituents

after though there’s no memory
who knows how to turn it off

I answered what I thought
who knows the way

I answered what I thought about
that their knowing
