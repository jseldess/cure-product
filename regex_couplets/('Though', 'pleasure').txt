('though', 'pleasure')

As though stationary and a destination
Which is a pleasure to never live out

though it was most emphatically that
there was no walking along the pleasure

though not many freeze up
up in the television pleasure

though not many facts up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

though as for conversing
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

though it is not a simple act
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

I thought
