('though', 'possession')

As though stationary and a destination
I speak to them my possessions

I thought
my possession of my children

after though thereâ€™s no memory
I speak them of my possessions

though we are waiting for her
speech my possession of my children

I answered what I thought
I stay the right of my possessions
