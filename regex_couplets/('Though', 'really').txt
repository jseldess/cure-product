('Though', 'really')

Though there are quarters goals
When they really take hold of my finger

Though in not many acts
without really agreeing

Though we are waiting for her
without really speaking

Though we are breaking 
without really breaking

Though we are waiting 
without really binding

Though we can’t help waiting
also didn’t really move
