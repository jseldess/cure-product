('though', 'reason')

As though stationary and a destination
reasons resources

though it was most emphatically that
with reasons

I had nightmares though
with little reason to move

though not many freeze up
Toward the start informally given my reasons

I thought
More reasons around my country 

though we are still breaking in
and could be inflected with reasons
