('though', 'ring')

As though stationary and a destination
bring your child along

though it was most emphatically that
hovering above standing water

I had nightmares though
actually considering the end

though not many freeze up
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I thought
firing and connecting somewhere

after though thereâ€™s no memory
The prospect for veering healthily
