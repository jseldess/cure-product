('though', 'set')

As though stationary and a destination
upset by Gingrich

though it was most emphatically that
in front of the set afternoon

I had nightmares though
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

I thought
Um, upset by Gingrich

though we are still breaking in
presets
