('though', 'side')

As though stationary and a destination
aside from the retinas

I had nightmares though
actually considering the end

though not many freeze up
But my not feeling the memory aside

I thought
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

after though thereâ€™s no memory
But my not feeling the memory inside

I answered what I thought
where I send and relive aside

I answered what I thought about
