('though', 'space')

As though stationary and a destination
in rotating directionless space

though there are quarters with goals
and then into rotating and directional space

though it was most emphatically that
in the space that it had

I thought
though we are breaking in the space that it had

after though thereâ€™s no memory
in the fill space
