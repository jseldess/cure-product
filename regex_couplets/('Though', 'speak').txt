('though', 'speak')

As though stationary and a destination
not speaking

I thought
without really speaking

though we are breaking in the space that it had
I speak to them

after though thereâ€™s no memory
I speak them of my possessions

though we are waiting for her
speak them of my possessions

I answered what I thought
