('though', 'static')

As though stationary and a destination
wrapped in static and explicit statements

though not many facts up in the sky

though as for conversing
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

though it is not a simple act
You can clear it also through static seizure

though it was most emphatically that
while wrapped in explicit static

I thought
