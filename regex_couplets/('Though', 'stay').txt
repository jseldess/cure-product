('though', 'stay')

As though stationary and a destination
wrestling to stay still

though there are quarters with goals
So stay with us

though not many freeze up
own stays brought loyal

I thought
own that stays brought loyal

though we are waiting for her
that stays brought loyal

I answered what I thought
I stay the right of my elections
