('though', 'still')

As though stationary and a destination
wrestling to stay still

though there are quarters with goals
I love my daughter still

though not many freeze up
though we are still breaking in

I thought
still wash conserving

after though thereâ€™s no memory
so still washed

though we are waiting for her
