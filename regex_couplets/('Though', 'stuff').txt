('though', 'stuff')

As though stationary and a destination
I hear it between bills and stuff

I had nightmares though
I can hear it between bills and stuff

though not many freeze up
I can hear them between bills and stuff

though not many facts up in the sky
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

though in not many acts up in the sky
between bills and stuffed animals

though it is not a simple act
bills and stuffed animals
