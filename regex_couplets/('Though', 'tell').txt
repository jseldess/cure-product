('though', 'tell')

As though stationary and a destination
Then I constellate my time family country

though it was most emphatically that
I constellate the time

I had nightmares though
I had to tell them the news

though not many freeze up
So I constellate the time family country

I thought
and that man comes on to tell me 

after though thereâ€™s no memory
