('Though', 'though')

Though there are quarters goals
As though stationary and a destination

Though how can you know without direction
though there are quarters with goals

Though in not many acts
though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts
though it is not a simple act

Though we are waiting for her
I thought

Though we are breaking 
after though there’s no memory

Though we can’t help waiting
I answered what I thought
