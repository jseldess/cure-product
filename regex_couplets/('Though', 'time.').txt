('though', 'time.')

As though stationary and a destination
where I sleep at times

though it was most emphatically that
 and time in the train

I had nightmares though
The long time I had a vision

though not many freeze up
without the long time I was accounting

though not many facts up in the sky
So I constellate the time family country

I thought
Or alter of course the time anyway

though we are still breaking in
until a happier time found

after though thereâ€™s no memory
formerly along time they were on

though we are waiting for her
time they were on

I answered what I thought
in the long time they were on
