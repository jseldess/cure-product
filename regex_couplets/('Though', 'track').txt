('though', 'track')

As though stationary and a destination
I reuse indelible tracks 

though not many freeze up
I resume indelible tracks

though not many facts up in the sky
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

though in not many acts up in the sky
in not many tracks up in the sky

though it is not a simple act
and other types of tracking technology

though it was most emphatically that
trackers collecting data on users

I thought
The trackers on users

though we are still breaking in
which as tracked befitted 

after though thereâ€™s no memory
which as tracked befitted phased

though we are waiting for her
sizes track for asking sound

I answered what I thought
sizes asking for tracking sound
