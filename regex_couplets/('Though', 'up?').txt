('though', 'up?')

As though stationary and a destination
And put in place as though stationary

though there are quarters with goals
They’re just not mine

though it was most emphatically that
not one virtue to excess

I had nightmares though
I am full of potential

though not many freeze up
white spots on a black surface

though not many face up
up in the television pleasure

though not many facts up in the sky
I resume unassimilable visions

though as for conversing
up in the television

though in not many acts up in the sky
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

though it is not a simple act
You can clear it also through static seizure

I thought
We had inhabited actually

though we are still breaking in
I though

though we are breaking in the space that it had
where I send and relive would be held

after though there’s no memory
in the form filled offered must

though we are waiting for her
I end up in Bach 

I answered what I thought
I assumed what I draw

I answered what I thought about
but standing in memory
