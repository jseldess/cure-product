('though', 'us')

As though stationary and a destination
russling to stay still

though there are quarters with goals
They’re just not mine

though it was most emphatically that
was not just a defeat

I had nightmares though
So stay with us

though not many freeze up
I want to cite a poem so usual

I thought
in the form filled offered in trust

though we are still breaking in
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

after though there’s no memory
in the form filled offered must

though we are waiting for her
radiating from housing

I answered what I thought
I have them trust in me
