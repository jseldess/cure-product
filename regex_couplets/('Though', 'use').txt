('though', 'use')

As though stationary and a destination
You use the most essential parts

I had nightmares though
I reuse unassimilable visions

though not many freeze up
I used my technology

I thought
trackers collecting data on users

though we are still breaking in
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

after though thereâ€™s no memory
