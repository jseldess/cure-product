('though', 'work')

As though stationary and a destination
nor work in this way daily

I had nightmares though
I need the work

though not many freeze up
I walk up and don’t work anymore

though it was most emphatically that
So I work and don’t look any

I thought
nor envy honest work

though we are still breaking in
