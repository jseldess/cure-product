('though', 'you.')

As though stationary and a destination
Though how can you know without direction

though there are quarters with goals
for how can you know without direction

though it was most emphatically that
if you have providence to excess

I had nightmares though
since you can imagine movement

though not many freeze up
You can hear it also through your leisure

I thought
This is your voice 

though we are still breaking in
the young ripples inaudibly
