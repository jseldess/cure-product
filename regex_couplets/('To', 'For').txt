('To', 'For')

To my children Walt Whitman
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

To my chidren
For whom drifting is not an exception

To my children
For whom 

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
Forecasting the story before dawn

Tomorrow
For an ungraspable time

To neither study
For Mitt Romney

To substitute neither study
For my own purchases

To the ends of transactions
Formerly a way like this one

To the ends of my transactions
Formerly away there are constant ways

To the other end of transactions
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

To the other end of transactions like this
Forty-one seconds in

To the right of determined elections
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
