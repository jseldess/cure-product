('To', 'It')

To my children Walt Whitman
It has been since

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

Tomorrow 
Its strategy comes before morning goals

Toward the start informally given my reasons
It’s not marshal exactly

To the ends of my transactions
It’s not marshall exactly

To the other end of transactions
