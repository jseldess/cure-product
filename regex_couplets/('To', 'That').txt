('To', 'That')

To my children Walt Whitman
That’s where I sleep at times

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
That’s when they really take

To that impossible place
That you can see only the back of

Tomorrow
That I captured an afterimage

To neither study
That are my right to say

To the right of determined elections
