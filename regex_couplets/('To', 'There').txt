('To', 'There')

To my children Walt Whitman
There are quarterly goals

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

To neither study
There was very little physical activity

Tomorrow
There are spots waiting

To substitute neither study
There are constant ways

To the other end of transactions
There are no constant ways

To the other end of my actions
