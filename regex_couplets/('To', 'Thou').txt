('To', 'Thou')

To my children Walt Whitman
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

Tomorrow
Though in not many acts

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
Though we are waiting for her

To neither study
Though we are breaking 

To the ends of transactions
Though we can’t help waiting

To the ends of my transactions
