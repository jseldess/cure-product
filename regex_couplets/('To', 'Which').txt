('To', 'Which')

To my children Walt Whitman
Which is a measure to never live out

To my chidren
Which can be pronounced to the world

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
Which is a pleasure to never live out

To neither study
Which can be called confidence

To substitute neither study
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

To the ends of transactions
