('To', 'while')

To my children Walt Whitman
Looking back while I should be sleeping

To that impossible place
while wrapped in static

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
while wrapped in explicit static

To neither study
I answered while interfaced

To the right of determined elections
for a while to listen already
