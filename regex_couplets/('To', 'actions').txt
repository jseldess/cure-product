('To', 'actions')

To my children Walt Whitman
to the ends of my transactions

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
The ends of my transactions

To the ends of transactions
to the ends of actions

To the other end of transactions
To the other end of my actions

To the other end of transactions like this
of my actions

To the other end of means like this one
the other end transactions

To the right of determined elections
