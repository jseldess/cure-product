('To', 'any')

To my children Walt Whitman
at any time it can drift again

To my chidren
Or the company

To that impossible place
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

Tomorrow
not many face up

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
I walk up and don’t work anymore

Toward the start informally given my reasons
So I work and don’t look any

To neither study
They have very many choices

To the ends of transactions
The many transparent pixel calls

To the other end of transactions
or imagined anyway
