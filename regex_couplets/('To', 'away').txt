('To', 'away')

To my children Walt Whitman
drifting away needs others presume desires

To my chidren
drifting away

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
Who throws contours away

To the ends of my transactions
Formerly away there are constant ways

To the other end of transactions
formerly away

To the right of determined elections
