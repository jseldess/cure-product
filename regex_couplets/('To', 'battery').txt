('To', 'battery')

To my children Walt Whitman
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
battery dawn nights 

To the ends of my transactions
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

To the other end of transactions
to the other end battery dawn 

To the right of determined elections
