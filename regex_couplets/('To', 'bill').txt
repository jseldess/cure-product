('To', 'bill')

To my children Walt Whitman
I hear it between bills and stuff

Tomorrow
I can hear it between bills and stuff

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
billowing in the cloud

To neither study
the bill my detuning 

To the right of determined elections
between bills and stuffed animals
