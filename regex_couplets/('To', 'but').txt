('To', 'but')

To my children Walt Whitman
I want but not to impart cynicism

To my chidren
Attributable or

To that impossible place
but the sun isnâ€™t up

Tomorrow 
but it continued

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
but where is it

To neither study
that decisions can be attributable

To the ends of my transactions
but for memory elsewhere

To the right of determined elections
decisions that can be attributable
