('To', 'call')

To my children Walt Whitman
though it was most emphatically that

To neither study
They are called aspirational

Tomorrow
Which can be called confidence

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
to take the call

To the ends of transactions
The many transparent pixel calls

To the other end of transactions
recalling aside

To the right of determined elections
