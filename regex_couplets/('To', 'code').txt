('To', 'code')

To my children Walt Whitman
May I have your zip code

To that impossible place
learned without too much difficulty to code

Tomorrow 
falling off the encoded end

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

To neither study
zipcode

To the ends of my transactions
