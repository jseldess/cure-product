('To', 'count')

To my children Walt Whitman
Then I constellate my time family country

To my chidren
So I constellate the time family country

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
I brought my count down

To that impossible place
without the long time I was accounting

Tomorrow
the simple act of honoring an accountant

Toward the start informally given my reasons
around my country 

To neither study
More reasons around my country 

To the ends of transactions
