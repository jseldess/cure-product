('To', 'data')

To my children Walt Whitman
I’ll pull my data higher up

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
I’ll pull my data

Tomorrow
The days of private data

Toward the start informally given my reasons
trackers collecting data on users

To the ends of transactions
my interfaced stand data

To the right of determined elections
