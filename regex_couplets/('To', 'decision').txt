('To', 'decision')

To my children Walt Whitman
the planning process for decisions

Tomorrow
attributable decisions

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
forgetting decisions 

To the ends of transactions
decisioned to learn 

To the ends of my transactions
decisioned to learn back

To the right of determined elections
decisions that can be attributable
