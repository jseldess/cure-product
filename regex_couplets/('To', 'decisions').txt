('To', 'decisions')

To my children Walt Whitman
the planning process for decisions

Tomorrow
attributable decisions

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
forgetting decisions 

To the ends of transactions
that decisions can be attributable

To the ends of my transactions
decisions that can be attributable
