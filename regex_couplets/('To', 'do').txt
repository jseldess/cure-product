('To', 'do')

To my children Walt Whitman
does not feel an exception

To my chidren
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

To my children
What does it mean to drift

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
The dogs and lillies

To neither study
I brought my head down

To that impossible place
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

Tomorrow 
What I do in my liesure

Toward the start informally given my reasons
So I work and don’t look any

To substitute neither study
and it doesn’t take long

To the ends of transactions
I only think I don’t listen
