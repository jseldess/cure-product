('To', 'earn')

To my children Walt Whitman
When we had jobs that were to earn

To neither study
I spend time online learning to code

To that impossible place
learned without too much difficulty to code

Tomorrow 
where you can earn more 

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
decisioned to learn 

To the ends of transactions
decisioned to learn back

To the ends of my transactions
phase decision for learning

To the right of determined elections
I learned my location
