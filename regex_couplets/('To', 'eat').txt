('To', 'eat')

To my children Walt Whitman
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

To my chidren
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
was not just a defeat

To that impossible place
executive breath

Tomorrow
of the habits I create

Toward the start informally given my reasons
And from that great distance

To neither study
for the creation of the universe

To the ends of transactions
burrowed about from repeated travels

To the right of determined elections
