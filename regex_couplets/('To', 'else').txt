('To', 'else')

To my children Walt Whitman
If you have confidence regardless all else

To neither study
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
and elsewhere my memory

To substitute neither study
and elsewhere my memory of you

To the ends of transactions
By my memory elsewhere

To the right of determined elections
