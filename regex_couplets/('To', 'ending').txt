('To', 'ending')

To my children Walt Whitman
I tried to feel the key values extending 

Tomorrow
talking into pheasants bending themselves

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
talking into percents bending themselves

To neither study
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

To the ends of transactions
battery dawn nights blending themselves

To the right of determined elections
