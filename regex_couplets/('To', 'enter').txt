('To', 'enter')

To my children Walt Whitman
The sun high enough to enter directly 

Toward the start informally given my reasons
I enter the flattening mirror

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
I have entered my purposes

To the ends of transactions
I have entered my phone

To the right of determined elections
