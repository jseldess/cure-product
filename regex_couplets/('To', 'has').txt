('To', 'has')

To my children Walt Whitman
It has been since

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
in traversing my purchase

Tomorrow
purchased out

To neither study
I have entered my purchases

To the ends of transactions
phase decisioned by the prospect

To the ends of my transactions
phase decisioned

To the right of determined elections
at the site of a purchase
