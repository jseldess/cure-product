('To', 'he')

To my children Walt Whitman
The dogs and lillies

To my chidren
without imparting the cynicism

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

To neither study
The South Carolina primary 

To that impossible place
Higher up in the results

Tomorrow
Then I cannot see face value

Toward the start informally given my reasons
the opacity given to them

To substitute neither study
only in the case

To the ends of transactions
though we are waiting for her

To the ends of my transactions
the way that I was going

To the other end of transactions
But my not feeling the memory inside

To the other end of my actions
To the other end of transactions like this

To the other end of means like this one
Like this one the other end of means

To the right of determined elections
To the right of interned possessions

To the right of deterred elections
To the right of interned elections
