('To', 'here')

To my children Walt Whitman
I’ll get there eventually

To my chidren
where I sleep at times

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

To neither study
Where official policy is to catch and release

To that impossible place
I’ll get there ruins

Tomorrow
there was no promotion

Toward the start informally given my reasons
but where is it

To substitute neither study
and elsewhere my memory of you

To the ends of transactions
Is there a baby and a bear

To the ends of my transactions
There are constant ways

To the other end of transactions
There are no constant ways

To the other end of my actions
Formerly away there are constant ways

To the other end of transactions like this
where rights ended themselves

To the right of determined elections
I learned the point where I am
