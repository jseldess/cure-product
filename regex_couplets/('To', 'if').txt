('To', 'if')

To my children Walt Whitman
drifting does not feel an exception

To my chidren
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

To my children
What does it mean to drift

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
if you have providence to excess

To neither study
out of the fifth page ruins

Tomorrow
learned without too much difficulty to code

Toward the start informally given my reasons
If I take a different measure

To substitute neither study
if you have providence

To the ends of transactions
if only on the way to the trash
