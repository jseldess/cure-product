('To', 'inter')

To my children Walt Whitman
way high up in the inter

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
hold at intervals riding forward

To that impossible place
high up in the internet

Tomorrow
with internally regulated climate

Toward the start informally given my reasons
Then I saw them interview

To neither study
my interfaced stand data

To the right of determined elections
To the right of interned possessions

To the right of deterred elections
To the right of interned elections
