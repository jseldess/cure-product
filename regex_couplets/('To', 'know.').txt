('To', 'know.')

To my children Walt Whitman
I even know what I would find

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
even when close to my knowing

To neither study
knowing the constituents

To the ends of transactions
who knows how to turn it off

To the ends of my transactions
who knows the way

To the other end of transactions
that their knowing
