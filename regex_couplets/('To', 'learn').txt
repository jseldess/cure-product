('To', 'learn')

To my children Walt Whitman
I spend time online learning to code

To that impossible place
learned without too much difficulty to code

Tomorrow 
decisioned to learn 

To the ends of transactions
decisioned to learn back

To the ends of my transactions
phase decision for learning

To the right of determined elections
I learned my location
