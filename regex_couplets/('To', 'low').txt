('To', 'low')

To my children Walt Whitman
slow asynchronous

To my chidren
to the pillow

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
low in the content architecture

To that impossible place
Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture

Tomorrow
I am not allowed to see their face

Toward the start informally given my reasons
under pillowing a cloud

To neither study
