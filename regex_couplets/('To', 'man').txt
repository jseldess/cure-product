To my children Walt Whitman
Walt Whitman

To my children
What Whitman

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
not many face up

Toward the start informally given my reasons
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

To neither study
They have very many choices

To the ends of transactions
The many transparent pixel calls

To the other end of transactions
