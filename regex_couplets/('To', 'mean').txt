('To', 'mean')

To my children Walt Whitman
What does it mean to drift

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
My means without gravity

To neither study
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

To the ends of transactions
The other end of means

To the other end of transactions
To the other end of means like this one

To the right of determined elections
