('To', 'move')

To my children Walt Whitman
since I can imagine movement

Tomorrow
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
myself moved literally as it is

To the ends of transactions
not literally moved about

To the right of determined elections
not literally moved
