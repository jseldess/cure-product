('To', 'nor')

To my children Walt Whitman
over the long line I would honor

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
nor work in this way daily

To that impossible place
the simple act of honoring an accountant

Toward the start informally given my reasons
nor envy honest work

To neither study
nor envy honestly

To substitute neither study
which had on honor to be told

To the ends of transactions
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

To the right of determined elections
