('To', 'now')

To my children Walt Whitman
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
out in the snow

Tomorrow
out in the snow fall

Toward the start informally given my reasons
even when close to my knowing

To neither study
knowing the constituents

To the ends of transactions
who knows how to turn it off

To the ends of my transactions
who knows the way

To the other end of transactions
that their knowing
