('To', 'our')

To my children Walt Whitman
You can hear it also through your leisure

To my chidren
bring your child along

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
reasons resources

To neither study
Two hours and

To that impossible place
or an available resource

Tomorrow
with four key value pairs

Toward the start informally given my reasons
or alter of course the time anyway

To substitute neither study
This is your chance

To the ends of transactions
Who throws contours away

To the ends of my transactions
who throws contours a way

To the other end of transactions
phrase them of our possessions
