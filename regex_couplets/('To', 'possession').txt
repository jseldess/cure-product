('To', 'possession')

To my children Walt Whitman
I speak to them my possessions

To the ends of transactions
my possession of my children

To the ends of my transactions
I speak them of my possessions

To the right of determined elections
To the right of interned possessions

To the right of deterred elections
to the right of possessions
