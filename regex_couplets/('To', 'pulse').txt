('To', 'pulse')

To my children Walt Whitman
impulse control

To that impossible place
I send and retrieve the impulse

To the ends of transactions
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

To the ends of my transactions
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

To the other end of transactions
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

To the other end of my actions
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

To the right of determined elections
