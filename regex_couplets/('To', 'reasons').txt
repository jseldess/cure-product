('To', 'reasons')

To my children Walt Whitman
reasons resources

To my chidren
with reasons

To neither study
with little reasons to aspiration

Tomorrow
Toward the start informally given my reasons

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
More reasons around my country 

To the ends of transactions
and could be inflected with reasons
