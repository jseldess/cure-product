('To', 'resume')

To my children Walt Whitman
and can’t presume to need

To my chidren
Then I can’t presume to need others

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
I resume unassimilable visions

Tomorrow
I resume indelible tracks

Toward the start informally given my reasons
I resume attributable visions

To neither study
I presume to others

To the ends of transactions
So I presume the offers already
