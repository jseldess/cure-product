('To', 'ring')

To my children Walt Whitman
bring your child along

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
ring

To neither study
hovering above standing water

Tomorrow
actually considering the end

Toward the start informally given my reasons
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

To substitute neither study
firing and connecting somewhere

To the ends of transactions
The prospect for veering healthily
