('To', 'side')

To my children Walt Whitman
aside from the retinas

Tomorrow
actually considering the end

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
But my not feeling the memory aside

To the ends of transactions
But my not feeling the memory inside

To the ends of my transactions
By my feeling the memory inside

To the other end of transactions like this
44 seconds inside

To the right of determined elections
