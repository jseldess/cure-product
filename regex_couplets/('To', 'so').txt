('To', 'so')

To my children Walt Whitman
You can hear it also through your leisure

To my chidren
who are so fresh and agile

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
reasons resources

To neither study
A person from a distance

To that impossible place
or an available resource

Tomorrow
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Toward the start informally given my reasons
More reasons 

To substitute neither study
More reasons around my country 

To the ends of transactions
by in the sound privacy

To the ends of my transactions
by in the sounded privacy

To the right of determined elections
buy in the sound privacy
