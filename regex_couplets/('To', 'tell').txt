('To', 'tell')

To my children Walt Whitman
Then I constellate my time family country

To my chidren
So I constellate the time family country

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
I constellate the time

To neither study
The CEO tells me to embody values

To that impossible place
I had to tell them the news

Tomorrow
I tell you my purposes

To substitute neither study
and that man comes on to tell me 

To the ends of transactions
