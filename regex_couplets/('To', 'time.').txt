('To', 'time.')

To my children Walt Whitman
where I sleep at times

To my chidren
over the long time up in the sky

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
So I constellate the time family country

To neither study
 and time in the train

To that impossible place
On the timeline I was on

Tomorrow
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

Toward the start informally given my reasons
The long time I had a vision

To substitute neither study
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

To the ends of transactions
formerly along time they were on

To the ends of my transactions
time they were on

To the right of determined elections
in the long time they were on
