('To', 'track')

To my children Walt Whitman
I reuse indelible tracks 

Tomorrow
The first track

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
and other types of tracking technology

To neither study
trackers collecting data on users

To the ends of transactions
which as tracked befitted 

To the ends of my transactions
which as tracked befitted phased

To the right of determined elections
sizes track for asking sound
