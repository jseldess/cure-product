('To', 'turn')

To my children Walt Whitman
in a sharp downward turn 

To my chidren
sudden downward turn

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
I keep turning back again myself

To that impossible place
who knows how to turn it off

To the ends of my transactions
I turn not sad exactly

To the right of determined elections
I returned not sad exactly
