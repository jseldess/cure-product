('To', 'up?')

To my children Walt Whitman
slow asynchronous

To my chidren
But not to impart cynicism

To my children
Without imparting cynicism 

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

To neither study
The South Carolina primary 

To that impossible place
Higher up in the results

Tomorrow
barely outlines

Toward the start informally given my reasons
around my country 

To substitute neither study
If you have confidence regardless all else

To the ends of transactions
though we are waiting for her

To the ends of my transactions
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

To the other end of transactions
But my not feeling the memory inside

To the other end of my actions
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

To the other end of transactions like this
I end up Bach

To the right of determined elections
which I feel formerly about for
