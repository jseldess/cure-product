('To', 'us')

To my children Walt Whitman
slow asynchronous

To my chidren
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
I want to cite a poem so usual

To neither study
was not just a defeat

To that impossible place
The ventillation rushes on

Tomorrow 
I just got a letter

Toward the start informally given my reasons
I have them trust in me

To substitute neither study
trackers collecting data on users

To the ends of transactions
radiating from housing

To the right of determined elections
