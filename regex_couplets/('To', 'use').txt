('To', 'use')

To my children Walt Whitman
You use the most essential parts

To that impossible place
I reuse unassimilable visions

Tomorrow
I reuse indelible tracks

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
I used my technology

To neither study
trackers collecting data on users

To the ends of transactions
