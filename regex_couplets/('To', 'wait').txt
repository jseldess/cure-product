('To', 'wait')

To my children Walt Whitman
There are spots waiting

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
Though we are waiting for her

To the ends of transactions
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

To the ends of my transactions
not needing to wait

To the right of determined elections
waiting out front or up above
