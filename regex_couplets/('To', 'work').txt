('To', 'work')

To my children Walt Whitman
nor work in this way daily

To that impossible place
Having transitioned from leisure to work

Tomorrow 
your bid to the next highest ranked network

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
I walk up and don’t work anymore

Toward the start informally given my reasons
So I work and don’t look any

To neither study
nor envy honest work

To substitute neither study
