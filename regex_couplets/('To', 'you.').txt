('To', 'you.')

To my children Walt Whitman
You can hear it also through your leisure

To my chidren
bring your child along

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
if you have providence to excess

To neither study
May I have your zip code

To that impossible place
That you can see only the back of

Tomorrow
If you have confidence regardless all else

To substitute neither study
This is your chance

To the ends of transactions
the young ripples inaudibly
