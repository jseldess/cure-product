('To', 'your')

To my children Walt Whitman
You can hear it also through your leisure

To my chidren
bring your child along

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
May I have your zip code

To that impossible place
your bid to the next highest ranked network

Tomorrow
This is your voice 

To neither study
This is your choice 

To substitute neither study
This is your chance

To the ends of transactions
