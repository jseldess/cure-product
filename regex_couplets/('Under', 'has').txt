('Under', 'has')

Under the last seen principle
purchased out

Under the grasp principle
having been purchased out

Under the grass principle
having been purchased out of you

Under the last principle 
Under the last principle of purchasing power

Under the past prinicple
And need out in front purchase

Under the past principle
For an ungraspable purchase
