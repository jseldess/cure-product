('under', 'he')

under pillowing a cloud
the cloud

under the last seen principle
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

she lay under the grass
of those gathered

under the grasp principle
Under the past prinicple

under the past principle
under the grass principle

designed to hold up my underwear
I designed them to hold up my underwear
