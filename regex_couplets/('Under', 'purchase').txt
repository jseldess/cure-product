('Under', 'purchase')

Under the last seen principle
purchased out

Under the grasp principle
having been purchased out

Under the grass principle
having been purchased out of you

Under the last principle 
for an ungraspable purchase

Under the past prinicple
And need out in front purchase

Under the past principle
I tell you the weight of my purchases
