('under', 'up?')

under pillowing a cloud
under pillowing a loud 

under the last seen principle
I resume attributable visions

she lay under the grass
for an ungraspable purchase

under the grasp principle
articles all around storming around

under the past principle
under the grass principle

designed to hold up my underwear
I designed them to hold up my underwear
