('what', 'bill')

a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i
I hear it between bills and stuff

I invited most of what came next
I can hear it between bills and stuff

I even know what I would find
I can hear them between bills and stuff

what literally moved
the bill my detuning 

to return what I bought
between bills and stuffed animals
