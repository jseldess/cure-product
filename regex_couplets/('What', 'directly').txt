('what', 'directly')

a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i
if not directly on my skin

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
of not directly from my skin

what I find there
But not to me directly

I invited most of what came next
The sun high enough to enter directly 

what literally moved
The sun high enough to strike directly
