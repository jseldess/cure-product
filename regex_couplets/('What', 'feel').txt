('What', 'feel')

What is an impure product
conversations with our feelings

What Whitman
I tried to feel the key values extending 

Whatâ€™s the next step
I tried to feel the extension of key values

What I do in my liesure
What would I feel without that goal

What would I feel without a goal
But my not feeling the memory aside
