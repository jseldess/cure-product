('What', 'front')

What is an impure product
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

What Whitman
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

What the next step
in front of the set afternoon

Whatâ€™s the next step
in front of the set of regulations

What I do in my liesure
And need out in front purchase
