('what', 'rest')

a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i
wrestling to stay still

what I find there
that agreed one of rest

what literally moved
Aligned or not with my interests

I answered what I thought
 as points which are my interest 

to return what I bought
home rest form to ourselves
