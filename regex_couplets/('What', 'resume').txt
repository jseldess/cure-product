('what', 'resume')

a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i
and canâ€™t presume to need

I invited most of what came next
I resume unassimilable visions

I even know what I would find
I resume indelible tracks

what literally moved
I presume to others

I answered what I thought
So I presume the offers already
