('what', 'stay')

a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i
wrestling to stay still

what I find there
So stay with us

I even know what I would find
own stays brought loyal

what literally moved
own that stays brought loyal

I answered what I thought
that stays brought loyal

I answered what I thought about
I stay the right of my elections

to return what I bought
home stays brought loyal
