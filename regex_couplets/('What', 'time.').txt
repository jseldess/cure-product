('what', 'time.')

a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i
only fragments of time with my children

what I find there
where I sleep at times

I invited most of what came next
The long time I had a vision

I even know what I would find
without the long time I was accounting

what literally moved
formerly along time they were on

I answered what I thought
time they were on

I assumed what I draw
in the long time they were on

I answered what I thought about
formerly along the time they were on

to return what I bought
