('what', 'up?')

a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i
What is an impure product

in light of learning what we see
conversation with our feelings

That’s exaclty what I want for them
The sun isn’t up 

what I find there
slow asynchronous

I invited most of what came next
I had nightmares though

I even know what I would find
White spots on a black surface

what literally moved
redundant

which is what feels most comfortable
in the form filled offered in trust

In what part did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

I answered what I thought
I thought

I assumed what I draw
I presume to others

I answered what I thought about
but standing in memory

to return what I bought
I returned not sad exactly
