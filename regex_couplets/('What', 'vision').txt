('What', 'vision')

What is an impure product
I had me a vision

What the next step
The planning process for visions

What’s the next step
The planning process is for visionaries only

What I do in my liesure
I reuse unassimilable visions

What would I feel without that goal
there wasn’t any television 

What was the last time
I resume unassimilable visions
