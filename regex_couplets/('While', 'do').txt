('while', 'do')

Looking back while I should be sleeping
which I brought down with qualities

at intervals while riding forward
I brought my head down

while wrapped in static
What I do in my liesure

while wrapped in explicit static
here is the site of the battle of maldon

while consuming damage
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I answered while interfaced
I only think I don’t listen

For a while I think I don’t listen
