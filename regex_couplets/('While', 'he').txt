('while', 'he')

Looking back while I should be sleeping
with my head

at intervals while riding forward
I brought my head down

while wrapped in static
You can hear it also through your leisure

while wrapped in explicit static
The long time I was a vision

while we’re wrapped in static
until I purpose the horizon

while consuming damage
I continued to dream then

I answered while interfaced
battery dawn nights ending themselves

for a while to listen already
So I presume the offers at home already

for a while to listen 
I resume the offers at home

for a while not to listen
presume the offers at 

For a while I think I don’t listen
traffick is there nonetheless
