('while', 'here')

Looking back while I should be sleeping
I’ll get there eventually

at intervals while riding forward
I’ll get there ruins

while wrapped in static
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

while wrapped in explicit static
I get through there

while consuming damage
where I need gravity

I answered while interfaced
but for memory elsewhere

for a while to listen already
traffick is there nonetheless
