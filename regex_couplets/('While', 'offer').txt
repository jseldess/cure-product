('while', 'offer')

Looking back while I should be sleeping
in the form filled offered in trust

I answered while interfaced
I assume the offers reliable

for a while to listen already
So I presume the offers at home already

for a while to listen 
I resume the offers at home

for a while not to listen
presume the offers at 

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
I presume the offers
