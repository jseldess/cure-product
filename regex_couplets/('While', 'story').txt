('while', 'story')

Looking back while I should be sleeping
Forecasting the story before dawn

while wrapped in static
as far back as my history heard

while wrapped in explicit static
for to tire as far back as my history

while weâ€™re wrapped in static
for as far back as my history

while consuming damage
