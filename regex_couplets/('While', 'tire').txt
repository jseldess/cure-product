('while', 'tire')

Looking back while I should be sleeping
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

while wrapped in static
until I could not be tired

while wrapped in explicit static
for to tire as far back as my history

while weâ€™re wrapped in static
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

I answered while interfaced
