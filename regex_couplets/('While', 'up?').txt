('while', 'up?')

Looking back while I should be sleeping
which I brought down with qualities

at intervals while riding forward
I brought my head down

while wrapped in static
You can hear it also through your leisure

while wrapped in explicit static
until I could not be tired

while we’re wrapped in static
until I could not be hired

while consuming damage
I used my technology

I answered while interfaced
I answered what I thought

for a while to listen already
So I presume the offers at home already

for a while to listen 
I resume the offers at home

for a while not to listen
presume the offers at 

For a while I think I don’t listen
but I own all that’s messageable
