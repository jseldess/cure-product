('while', 'you.')

Looking back while I should be sleeping
That you can see only the back of

while wrapped in static
You can hear it also through your leisure

while wrapped in explicit static
you need history

while weâ€™re wrapped in static
a futile joyous white sun

while consuming damage
I tell you my purposes

I answered while interfaced
the young ripples inaudibly

for a while to listen already
