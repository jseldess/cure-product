('Whitman', 'does')

as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
does not feel an exception

To my children Walt Whitman
drifting does not feel an exception

Walt Whitman
What does it mean to drift

Walt Whitman drifted
and it doesn’t take long
