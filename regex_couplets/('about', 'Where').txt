('about', 'Where')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Where official policy is to catch and release

burrowed about from repeated travels
Where in me did I host

and literally moved about
Where in me did I lose

about the site
Where in me did I loose

answered about 
Where in me pre-worn

I answered about
Where in me did I lose trust

which I feel formerly about for
