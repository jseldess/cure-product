('about', 'blend')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
walking into percents blending themselves

burrowed about from repeated travels
where I blend and relive

and literally moved about
where lights blended themselves

I answered about
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

about
