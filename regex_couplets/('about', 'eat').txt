('about', 'eat')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
too sunny to eat ice cream

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
I reach repeated expressions first

burrowed about from repeated travels
from cables reheated travels

and literally moved about
for the creation of the universe

answered about 
deep into pathways from repeated travels

which I feel formerly about for
