('about', 'feel')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
conversations with our feelings

burrowed about from repeated travels
But my not feeling the memory aside

and literally moved about
which feels most comfortable

answered about 
which is what feels most comfortable

about the site
which I feel formerly about for

not literally moved about
But my not feeling the memory inside

I answered about
But my feeling the memory aside

I answered what I thought about
