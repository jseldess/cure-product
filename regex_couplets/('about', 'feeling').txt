('about', 'feeling')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
conversations with our feelings

burrowed about from repeated travels
But my not feeling the memory aside

and literally moved about
But my not feeling the memory inside

I answered about
But my feeling the memory aside

which I feel formerly about for
