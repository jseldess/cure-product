('about', 'form')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
There are performance reviews

burrowed about from repeated travels
in the form filled offered in trust

and literally moved about
with dawn already formerly nights 

answered about 
in the form filled offered trust

I answered about
which I feel formerly about for

not literally moved about
in the form filled offered must

I answered what I thought about
shone formerly along time

about 
own best form
