('about', 'he')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
Then I cannot see face value

burrowed about from repeated travels
from cables reheated travels

and literally moved about
and for which the plan agreed

answered about 
Where in me did I lose

about the site
about the site hosting

about the sight hosting trusting
by the sight of the hosting answered about

I answered about
washed

which I feel formerly about for
washed I answered about

not literally moved about
But my not feeling the memory inside

I answered what I thought about
battery dawn nights ending themselves

about 
I stay the right of my elections
