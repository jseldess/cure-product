('about', 'her')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Of course there is a direction

burrowed about from repeated travels
where I send and relive

and literally moved about
Where in me did I host

answered about 
Where in me did I lose

about the site
Where in me did I loose

I answered about
By my memory elsewhere

which I feel formerly about for
after though thereâ€™s no memory

not literally moved about
where I send and relive aside

I answered what I thought about
where rights ended themselves

about 
I learned the point where I am
