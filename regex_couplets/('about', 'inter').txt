('about', 'inter')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
interjecting on a day ambition

burrowed about from repeated travels
my interfaced stand data

which I feel formerly about for
Aligned or not with my interests

not literally moved about
I interfaced

I answered about
 as points which are my interest
