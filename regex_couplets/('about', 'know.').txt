('about', 'know.')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
who knows the way

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
how can I know without direction

burrowed about from repeated travels
knowing the constituents

and literally moved about
who knows how to turn it off

I answered about
that their knowing
