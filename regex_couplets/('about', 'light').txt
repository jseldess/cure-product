('about', 'light')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
variegated reflected light

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
In the retroactive light

burrowed about from repeated travels
stopped light with validated fields

I answered about
where lights blended themselves

which I feel formerly about for
stopped light with validated faces

not literally moved about
