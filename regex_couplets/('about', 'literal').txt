('about', 'literal')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
and literally moved

burrowed about from repeated travels
and literally unproved

and literally moved about
when it is not literal

answered about 
what literally moved

about the site
not literally moved about

washed I answered about
not literally moved

which I feel formerly about for
