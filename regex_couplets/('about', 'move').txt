('about', 'move')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
since I can imagine movement

burrowed about from repeated travels
myself moved literally as it is

and literally moved about
I move

answered about 
what literally moved

about the site
not literally moved about

washed I answered about
also didnâ€™t really move

which I feel formerly about for
not literally moved
