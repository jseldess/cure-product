('about', 'moved')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
and literally moved

burrowed about from repeated travels
myself moved literally as it is

and literally moved about
I literally moved

answered about 
what literally moved

about the site
not literally moved about

washed I answered about
not literally moved

which I feel formerly about for
