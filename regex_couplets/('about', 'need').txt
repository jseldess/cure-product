('about', 'need')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

burrowed about from repeated travels
without really needing

and literally moved about
in need one in that best own

answered about 
need one in best own

I answered about
not needing to wait

which I feel formerly about for
that in need one best own
