('about', 'now')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
on a snow day with my children

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

burrowed about from repeated travels
knowing the constituents

and literally moved about
who knows the way

I answered about
who knows how to turn it off

which I feel formerly about for
that their knowing
