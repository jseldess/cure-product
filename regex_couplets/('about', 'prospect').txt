('about', 'prospect')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
the impulse for my own prospects

burrowed about from repeated travels
stopping into the prospect

and literally moved about
speech that is of by prospects

I answered about
the impulse my own prospects

answered about 
The prospects there already
