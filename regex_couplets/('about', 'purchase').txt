('about', 'purchase')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
conversations with our purchase

burrowed about from repeated travels
converting sight into a purchase

I answered about
for my own purchases

which I feel formerly about for
impulse for my own purchases

answered about 
at the site of a purchase
