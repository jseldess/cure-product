('about', 'really')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
it was really sunny

about my children’s consumption
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

burrowed about from repeated travels
without really branding 

and literally moved about
without really binding

answered about 
also didn’t really move

which I feel formerly about for
