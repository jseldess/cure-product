('about', 'side')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Iâ€™m simply inside

burrowed about from repeated travels
where I am aside

and literally moved about
by the side of the hosting service

answered about 
But my not feeling the memory inside

I answered about
But my not feeling the memory aside

which I feel formerly about for
