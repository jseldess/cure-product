('about', 'time.')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
only fragments of time with my children

burrowed about from repeated travels
until a happier time found

and literally moved about
formerly a long time they were on

answered about 
formerly along time they were on

I answered about
in the long time they were on

I answered what I thought about
time they were on

about
