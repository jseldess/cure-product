('about', 'turn')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
In a sharp downard turn

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
in a sharp downward turn 

burrowed about from repeated travels
who knows how to turn it off

I answered about
I turn not sad exactly

not literally moved about
I return not sad exactly

which I feel formerly about for
I returned not sad exactly
