('about', 'up?')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
Then I cannot see face value

burrowed about from repeated travels
answered about 

and literally moved about
in the form filled offered in trust

about the site
about the site hosting

about the sight hosting trusting
by the sight of the hosting answered about

I answered about
which I feel formerly about for

not literally moved about
washed I answered about

I answered what I thought about
but standing in memory

about 
iced coffee and sun position
