('about', 'us')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Because it was really dark

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

burrowed about from repeated travels
useless for not having paid

and literally moved about
in the form filled offered in trust

answered about 
about the sight hosting trusting

by the sight of the hosting answered about
in the form filled offered trust

I answered about
in the form filled offered must

which I feel formerly about for
radiating from housing

I answered what I thought about
I have them trust in me
