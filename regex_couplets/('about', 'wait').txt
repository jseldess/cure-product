('about', 'wait')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
There are spots waiting

burrowed about from repeated travels
Though we are waiting 

and literally moved about
Though we are waiting for her

answered about 
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

I answered about
not needing to wait

which I feel formerly about for
waiting out front or up above
