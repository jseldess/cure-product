('across', 'It')

Before we walk across the wide field
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

Before we walk across the wide opening
It keeps coming down thankfully

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
It has been since

across the retinas
It’s not marshal exactly

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
