('across', 'On')

Before we walk across the wide field
On a snow day with my children

Before we walk across the wide opening
One day there is direction

Before anyone walks across the opening
On a day there will be direction

across the retinas
On the other hand

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
One was up where it should be down

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
