('across', 'That')

Before we walk across the wide field
Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them

Before anyone has walked across the field
That is itself not still

across the retinas
That company creates a life

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
That I captured an afterimage

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
