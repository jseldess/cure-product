('across', 'There')

Before we walk across the wide field
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Before anyone walks across the opening
There are quarterly goals

across the retinas
There was very little physical activity

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
There are spots waiting

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
