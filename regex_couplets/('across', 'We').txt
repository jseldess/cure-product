('across', 'We')

Before we walk across the wide field
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

Before we walk across the wide opening
We can wrestle them with their goals

across the retinas
We had to say goodbye there

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
We got paid one way by a voice

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
