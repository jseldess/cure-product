('across', 'any')

Before we walk across the wide field
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Before we walk across the wide opening
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Before anyone walks across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the field
at any time it can drift again

across the retinas
The days aligned for company

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
