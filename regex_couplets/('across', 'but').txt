('across', 'but')

Before we walk across the wide field
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

Before we walk across the wide opening
but not impart cynicism

across the retinas
but it continued rippling muscle

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
but where is it

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
