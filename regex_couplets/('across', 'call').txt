('across', 'call')

Before we walk across the wide field
not calling or echoing for once

Before we walk across the wide opening
though it was most emphatically that

across the retinas
Which can be called confidence

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
to take the call

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
