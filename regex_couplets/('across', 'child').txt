('across', 'child')

Before we walk across the wide field
On a snow day with my children

Before we walk across the wide opening
about my childrenâ€™s consumption

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
especially in a child

across the retinas
even my child

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
my possession of my children

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
