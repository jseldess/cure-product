('across', 'come')

Before we walk across the wide field
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

Before we walk across the wide opening
Strategy comes before morning

across the retinas
and that man comes on to tell me 

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
and come home to remind inflections
