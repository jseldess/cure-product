('across', 'count')

Before we walk across the wide field
Then I constellate my time family country

Before we walk across the wide opening
So I constellate the time family country

across the retinas
without the long time I was accounting

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
around my country 

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
