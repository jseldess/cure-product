('across', 'country')

Before we walk across the wide field
Then I constellate my time family country

Before we walk across the wide opening
So I constellate the time family country

across the retinas
around my country 

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
More reasons around my country 

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
