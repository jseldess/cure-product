('across', 'day')

Before we walk across the wide field
On a snow day with my children

Before we walk across the wide opening
One day there is direction

Before anyone walks across the opening
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

across the retinas
The days were long

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
The day

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
