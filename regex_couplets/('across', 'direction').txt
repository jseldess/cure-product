('across', 'direction')

Before we walk across the wide field
into rotating directionless 

Before we walk across the wide opening
Of course there is a direction

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
One day there is direction

Before anyone walks across the opening
on a day there will be direction

across the retinas
stopping off in all directions
