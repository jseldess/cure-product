('across', 'directly')

Before we walk across the wide field
if not directly on my skin

Before anyone walks across the opening
of not directly from my skin

across the retinas
The sun high enough to enter directly 

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
The sun high enough to strike directly

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
