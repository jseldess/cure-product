('across', 'do')

Before we walk across the wide field
in a sharp downward turn 

Before we walk across the wide opening
In a sharp downard turn

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
does not feel an exception

across the retinas
What I do in my liesure

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
