('across', 'earn')

Before we walk across the wide field
in light of learning what we see

Before anyone walks across the opening
When we had jobs that were to earn

across the retinas
where you can earn more 

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
decisioned to learn 

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
