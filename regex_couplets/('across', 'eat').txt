('across', 'eat')

Before we walk across the wide field
too sunny to eat ice cream

Before we walk across the wide opening
I reach repeated expressions first

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
I propogated repeated expressions first

Before anyone walks across the opening
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

across the retinas
That company creates a life

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
it was not just a defeat

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
