('across', 'ending')

Before we walk across the wide field
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Before we walk across the wide opening
I tried to feel the key values extending 

across the retinas
talking into pheasants bending themselves

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
talking into percents bending themselves

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
