('across', 'find')

Before we walk across the wide field
I want to find a way to block it incoming

Before anyone walks across the opening
I can find a way to block it incoming

Before anyone has walked across the opening
I can find a way to block incoming 

Before anyone has walked across the field
I can find a way to block it

across the retinas
I even know what I would find

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
So I find myself at home

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
