('across', 'front')

Before we walk across the wide field
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Before anyone walks across the opening
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

across the retinas
And need out in front purchase

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
behind or out front or up above

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
