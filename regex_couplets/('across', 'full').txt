('across', 'full')

Before we walk across the wide field
It keeps coming down thankfully

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
I am full of potential

across the retinas
with full potential to movement

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
full of the missing words

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
