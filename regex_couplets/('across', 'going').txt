('across', 'going')

Before we walk across the wide field
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Before we walk across the wide opening
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
The way that she is going

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
