('across', 'has')

Before we walk across the wide field
conversations with our purchase

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Before anyone has walked across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the field
It has been since

across the retinas
in traversing my purchase

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
purchased out

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
