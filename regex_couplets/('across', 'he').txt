('across', 'he')

Before we walk across the wide field
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

Before we walk across the wide opening
who knows the way

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
In the light of retroactive

Before anyone walks across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the field
from the incoming stream

across the retinas
The days were long

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
advancing the time

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
I assumed that they were divisible
