('across', 'here')

Before we walk across the wide field
I’ll get there eventually

Before we walk across the wide opening
Of course there is a direction

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Before anyone walks across the opening
One day there is direction

across the retinas
There was very little physical activity

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
but where is it

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
