('across', 'if')

Before we walk across the wide field
drifting away

Before we walk across the wide opening
if not directly on my skin

Before anyone walks across the opening
drifting does not feel an exception

across the retinas
That company creates a life

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
If I take a different measure

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
