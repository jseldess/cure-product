('across', 'inter')

Before we walk across the wide field
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Before we walk across the wide opening
interjecting on a day ambition

Before anyone walks across the opening
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

across the retinas
Then I saw them interview

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
my interfaced stand data

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
