('across', 'just')

Before we walk across the wide field
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Before anyone walks across the opening
Theyâ€™re just not mine

across the retinas
it was not just a defeat

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
was not just a defeat

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
