('across', 'man')

Before we walk across the wide field
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

Before we walk across the wide opening
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

across the retinas
not many face up

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
