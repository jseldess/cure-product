('across', 'nor')

Before we walk across the wide field
into the minority proportion of time

Before we walk across the wide opening
over the long line I would honor

across the retinas
the simple act of honoring an accountant

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
nor work in this way daily

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
