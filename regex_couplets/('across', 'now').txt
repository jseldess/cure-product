('across', 'now')

Before we walk across the wide field
On a snow day with my children

Before we walk across the wide opening
who knows the way

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

across the retinas
I take it out in the snow fall

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
even when close to my knowing

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
