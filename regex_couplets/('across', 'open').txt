('across', 'open')

Before we walk across the wide field
Before we walk across the wide opening

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Before anyone buys up the opening

Before anyone walks across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the field
my desires were open

across the retinas
The simple act opening surmounted

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
