('across', 'our')

Before we walk across the wide field
reasons resources

Before we walk across the wide opening
conversations with our purchase

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
conversations with our reactions

Before anyone walks across the opening
You can hear it also through your leisure

across the retinas
or alter of course the time anyway

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
This is your voice 

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
