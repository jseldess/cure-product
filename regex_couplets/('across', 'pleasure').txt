('across', 'pleasure')

Before we walk across the wide field
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Before we walk across the wide opening
Which is a pleasure to never live out

across the retinas
there was no walking along the pleasure

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
