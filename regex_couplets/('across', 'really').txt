('across', 'really')

Before we walk across the wide field
because it was really dark

Before we walk across the wide opening
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Before anyone walks across the opening
When they really take hold of my finger

across the retinas
without really agreeing

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
without really speaking

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
