('across', 'side')

Before we walk across the wide field
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Before we walk across the wide opening
I’m simply inside

across the retinas
aside from the retinas

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
But my not feeling the memory aside

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
