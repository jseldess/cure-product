('across', 'skin')

Before we walk across the wide field
skin smile repeated expressions

Before anyone walks across the opening
if not directly on my skin

Before anyone has walked across the opening
of not directly from my skin

across the retinas
sizes track for asking sound

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
