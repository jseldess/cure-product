('across', 'so')

Before we walk across the wide field
reasons resources

Before we walk across the wide opening
When I want something

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Before anyone walks across the opening
You can hear it also through your leisure

across the retinas
my associations

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
Toward the start informally given my reasons

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
and could be inflected with reasons
