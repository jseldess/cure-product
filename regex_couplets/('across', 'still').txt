('across', 'still')

Before we walk across the wide field
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Before we walk across the wide opening
That is itself not still

across the retinas
I love my daughter still

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
though we are still breaking in

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
