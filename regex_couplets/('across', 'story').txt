('across', 'story')

Before we walk across the wide field
I told her a story, she drew waves.

Before we walk across the wide opening
Forecasting the story before dawn

across the retinas
as far back as my history heard

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
You need history

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
