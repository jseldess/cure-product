('across', 'tell')

Before we walk across the wide field
Then I constellate my time family country

Before we walk across the wide opening
So I constellate the time family country

across the retinas
I had to tell them the news

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I tell you my purposes

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
