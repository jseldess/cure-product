('across', 'than')

Before we walk across the wide field
It keeps coming down thankfully

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
than in the incoming stream

before anyone has walked across the opening
than solid ground

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
Having seen more than 

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
