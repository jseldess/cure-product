('across', 'time.')

Before we walk across the wide field
Then I constellate my time family country

Before we walk across the wide opening
only fragments of time with my children

across the retinas
The long time I had a vision

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
The long time I was a vision

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
