('across', 'tire')

Before we walk across the wide field
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

across the retinas
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
for to tire as far back as my history

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
