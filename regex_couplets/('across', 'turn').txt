('across', 'turn')

Before we walk across the wide field
in a sharp downward turn 

Before we walk across the wide opening
In a sharp downard turn

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
sudden downward turn

across the retinas
who knows how to turn it off

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
