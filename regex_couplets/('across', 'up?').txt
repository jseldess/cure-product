('across', 'up?')

Before we walk across the wide field
I’ll get there eventually

Before we walk across the wide opening
In a sharp downard turn

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
conversations with our reactions

Before anyone walks across the opening
The sun isn’t up 

across the retinas
I argued that the days were longer

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I walk up and don’t work anymore

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
I assumed that they were divisible
