('across', 'use')

Before we walk across the wide field
because it was really dark

Before we walk across the wide opening
You use the most essential parts

across the retinas
I reuse unassimilable visions

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I used my technology

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
