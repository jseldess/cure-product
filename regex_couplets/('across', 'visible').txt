('across', 'visible')

Before we walk across the wide field
I assumed it was visible

Before we walk across the wide opening
Iâ€™ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

across the retinas
I assume the offers divisible

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
I assumed that they were divisible
