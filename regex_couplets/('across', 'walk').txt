('across', 'walk')

Before we walk across the wide field
Before we walk across the wide opening

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Before anyone walks across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the field

across the retinas
there was no walking along the pleasure

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
