('across', 'want')

Before we walk across the wide field
When I want something

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
I want to find a way to block it incoming

Before anyone walks across the opening
Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them

Before anyone has walked across the field
I want but not to impart cynicism

across the retinas
all that I can think I want

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I want to cite a poem so usual

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
