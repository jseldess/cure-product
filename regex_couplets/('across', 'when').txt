('across', 'When')

Before we walk across the wide field
When I woke up in the morning

Before we walk across the wide opening
When I want something

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
When we had jobs that were to earn

across the retinas
When closed to my knowing

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
When I'm watching my tv 

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
