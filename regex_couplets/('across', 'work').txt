('across', 'work')

Before we walk across the wide field
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

Before we walk across the wide opening
nor work in this way daily

across the retinas
I need the work

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
