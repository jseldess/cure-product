('act', 'Bach')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
I end up in Bach 

to the ends of transactions
I end up in Bach and Selma

to the ends of my transactions
I end up Bach

the ends of my transactions
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

to the other end of actions
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

The other ends of my transactions
and end up in Bach

To the other end of my actions
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

the other end of actions
I end up Bach forty-one seconds in

to the other end of transactions
I end up in Bach with no way 

of my actions
on Bach

I turn not sad exactly
