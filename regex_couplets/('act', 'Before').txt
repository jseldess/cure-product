('act', 'Before')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Before we walk across the wide opening

In the retroactive light
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

In the light of retroactive
Before anyone buys up the opening

One day was actually
Before morning goals

and strategies not tactics
