('act', 'For')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I was enjoined to act again myself
Forecasting the story before dawn

and strategies not tactics
For an ungraspable time

we had inhabited actually
For Mitt Romney

The ends of my transactions
Formerly a way like this one

It’s not marshal exactly
Formerly away there are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

the other end of actions
Forty-one seconds in

to the other end of actions
For a while I think I don’t listen

before I act on them
