('act', 'It')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
It keeps coming down thankfully

In the light of retroactive conversations
It has been since

I was enjoined to act again
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

and strategies not tactics
It’s not marshal exactly

the other end transactions
It’s not marshall exactly

of my actions
