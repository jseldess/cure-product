('act', 'My')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
My associations

There was very little physical activity
My purpose up in the sky

we had inhabited actually
My daughter with her way

to the ends of my transactions
My daughter helps too

Itâ€™s not marshal exactly
My say to the elections

I return not sad exactly
My state kept loaned impression

before I act on them
