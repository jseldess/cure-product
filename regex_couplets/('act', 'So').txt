('act', 'so')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
When I want something

before we can have a retroactive
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

One day was actually
You can hear it also through your leisure

I was enjoined to act again myself
soft paper

I was enjoined to act again
or an available resource

and strategies not tactics
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I am bid to act again
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I am enjoined to act again
My associations

There was very little physical activity
with little reasons to aspiration

I was bid to act again myself
with little reason to move

actually considering the end
If I take some different measure

I refuse indelible tracts
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

though not many facts up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through investiture

Though in not many acts
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

in the simple act of reading
You can clear it also through static seizure

The simple act opening surmounted
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

the simple act of honoring an accountant
You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure

we had inhabited actually
I want to cite a poem so usual

The ends of my transactions
firing and connecting somewhere

to the ends of my transactions
so still watch them

To the ends of transactions
by in the sound privacy

to the ends of actions
by in the sounded privacy

I turn not sad exactly
buy in the sound privacy

before I act on them
sizes track for asking sound
