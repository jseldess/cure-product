('act', 'That')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
That’s exaclty what I want for them

One day was actually
That is itself not still

I was enjoined to act again myself
That’s where I sleep at times

I was enjoined to act again
That you can see only the back of

Not goals or tactics
That company creates a life

There was very little physical activity
That I captured an afterimage

we had inhabited actually
That are my right to say

I return not sad exactly
