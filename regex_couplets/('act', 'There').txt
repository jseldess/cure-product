('act', 'There')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

One day was actually
There are quarterly goals

I was enjoined to act again myself
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I was enjoined to act again
There was very little physical activity

I am enjoined to act again
There are spots waiting

we had inhabited actually
There are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
There are no constant waves

The other ends of my transactions
There are no constant ways

The other end of my transactions
