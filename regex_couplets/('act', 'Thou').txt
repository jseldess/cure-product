('act', 'Thou')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Though there are quarters goals

I was enjoined to act again myself
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

actually considering the end
Though in not many acts

Though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

Though it is not many simple acts
Though it is not a simple act

in the simple act of reading
Though we are waiting for her

to the ends of my transactions
Though we are breaking 

The ends of my transactions
Though we are waiting 

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
Though we can’t help waiting

It’s not marshal exactly
