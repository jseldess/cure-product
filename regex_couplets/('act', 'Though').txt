('act', 'though')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
As though stationary and a destination

I was enjoined to act again myself
though it was most emphatically that

I was enjoined to act again
I had nightmares though

There was very little physical activity
though not many freeze up

though not many facts up in the sky
though as for conversing

Though in not many acts
though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts
though it is not a simple act

The simple act opening surmounted
I thought

to the ends of my transactions
though we are still breaking in

The ends of my transactions
after though thereâ€™s no memory

To the ends of transactions
though we are waiting for her

to the ends of actions
I answered what I thought

I turn not sad exactly
I answered what I thought about

I return not sad exactly
