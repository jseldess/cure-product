('act', 'To')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
To my children Walt Whitman

I was enjoined to act again myself
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

I was enjoined to act again
To that impossible place

and strategies not tactics
Tomorrow

actually considering the end
Toward the start informally given my reasons

we had inhabited actually
To neither study

The ends of my transactions
To the ends of transactions

to the ends of my transactions
To the other end of transactions

To the other end of my actions
To the other end of transactions like this

of my actions
To the other end of means like this one

the other end transactions
To the right of determined elections

I returned not sad exactly
