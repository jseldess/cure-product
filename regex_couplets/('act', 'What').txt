('act', 'what')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
in light of learning what we see

before we can have a retroactive
Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them

One day was actually
what I find there

I was enjoined to act again myself
I invited most of what came next

I was enjoying acting against myself
I even know what I would find

actually considering the end
what literally moved

To the ends of transactions
I answered what I thought

I turn not sad exactly
I answered what I thought about

I return not sad exactly
to return what I bought

I returned not sad exactly
