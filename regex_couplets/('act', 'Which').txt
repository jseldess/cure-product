('act', 'Which')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Which is a measure to never live out

I was enjoined to act again myself
Which can be pronounced to the world

I was enjoined to act again
Which is a pleasure to never live out

we had inhabited actually
Which can be called confidence

The ends of my transactions
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

To the ends of transactions
