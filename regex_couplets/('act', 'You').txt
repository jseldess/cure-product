('act', 'You')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
You can hear it also through your leisure

I was enjoined to act again myself
You use the most essential parts

I was enjoined to act again
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

in the simple act of reading
You can clear it also through static seizure

The simple act opening surmounted
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

the simple act of honoring an accountant
You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure

we had inhabited actually
You can have seen offering
