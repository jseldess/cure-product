('act', 'across')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Before we walk across the wide opening

In the retroactive light
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

In the light of retroactive
Before anyone walks across the opening

One day was actually
across the retinas

There was very little physical activity
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

we had inhabited actually
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
