('act', 'acts')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
I refuse indelible tracts

I refuse indelible contracts
though not many facts up in the sky

Though in not many acts
Though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts
Though it is not many simple acts

not the simple act
