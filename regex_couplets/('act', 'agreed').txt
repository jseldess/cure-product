('act', 'agreed')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
and to which I’ve agreed

to the ends of my transactions
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

The ends of my transactions
and for which the plan agreed

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
that agreed one of rest

to the ends of actions
that agreed home

before I act on them
that agreed to one the people
