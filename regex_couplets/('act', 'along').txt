('act', 'along')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
bring your child along

I was enjoined to act again myself
The days lined along company

There was very little physical activity
there was no walking along the pleasure

actually considering the end
formerly along time they were on

to the ends of actions
formerly along my say to the elections

I turn not sad exactly
shone formerly along time

I return not sad exactly
