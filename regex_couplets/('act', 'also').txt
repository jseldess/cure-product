('act', 'also')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
You can hear it also through your leisure

I was enjoined to act again myself
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I refuse indelible tracts
I cannot clear it also through investiture

though not many facts up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Though in not many acts
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

in the simple act of reading
You can clear it also through static seizure

The simple act opening surmounted
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

the simple act of honoring an accountant
You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure

we had inhabited actually
also didnâ€™t really move

I turn not sad exactly
