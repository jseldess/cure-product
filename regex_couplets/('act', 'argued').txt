('act', 'argued')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
I argued the days felt longer

and strategies not tactics
I argued the days were longer

I was enjoying acting against myself
or argued for them at least

There was very little physical activity
I argued that the days were longer

I am enjoined to act again
