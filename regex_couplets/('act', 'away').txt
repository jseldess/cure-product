('act', 'away')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
drifting away needs others presume desires

I was enjoined to act again myself
drifting away from the task

I was enjoined to act again
Who throws contours away

To the ends of my transactions
Formerly away there are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
formerly away

to the other end of actions
