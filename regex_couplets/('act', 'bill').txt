('act', 'bill')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
I hear it between bills and stuff

and strategies not tactics
I can hear it between bills and stuff

actually considering the end
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I refuse indelible contracts
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

Though in not many acts
between bills and stuffed animals

though it is not a simple act
billowing in the cloud

we had inhabited actually
the bill my detuning 

I returned not sad exactly
bills and stuffed animals

before I act on them
