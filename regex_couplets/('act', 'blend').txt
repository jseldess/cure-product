('act', 'blend')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
battery dawn nights blending themselves

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
walking into percents blending themselves

we had inhabited actually
where I blend and relive

The ends of my transactions
where lights blended themselves

I turn not sad exactly
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

I return not sad exactly
