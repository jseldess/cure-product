('act', 'but')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
but not impart cynicism

I was enjoined to act again myself
Attributable or

I was enjoined to act again
but the sun isnâ€™t up

and strategies not tactics
but it continued

I am enjoined to act again
but it continued rippling muscle

There was very little physical activity
but would I love her the same

actually considering the end
but I can hear them

Though in not many acts
I resume attributable visions

we had inhabited actually
that decisions can be attributable

to the ends of actions
but for memory elsewhere

I return not sad exactly
decisions that can be attributable

before I act on them
revisions that can be attributable
