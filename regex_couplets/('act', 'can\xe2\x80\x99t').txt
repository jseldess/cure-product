('act', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
I can’t fix them without direction

I was enjoined to act again myself
Then I can’t presume to need others

I was enjoined to act again
That can’t be glimpsed

Not goals or tactics
Though we can’t help waiting

to the ends of my transactions
Though we can’t help waiting for her

It’s not marshal exactly
I can’t remember them

before I act on them
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
