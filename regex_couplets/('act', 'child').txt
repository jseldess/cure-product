('act', 'child')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
about my childrenâ€™s consumption

In the retroactive light
on a snow day with my children

In the light of retroactive 
especially in a child

One day was actually
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

I was enjoined to act again myself
even my child

we had inhabited actually
my possession of my children

to the ends of my transactions
speech my possession of my children

to the ends of actions
