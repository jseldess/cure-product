('act', 'constant')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
with constant ways 

Itâ€™s not marshal exactly
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

to the other end of actions
who throws a constant way

to the ends of my transactions
There are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
with no constant way

The other ends of my transactions
There are no constant ways

The other end of my transactions
Formerly away there are constant ways

To the other end of transactions like this
with constant ways to the other end

to the other end of transactions
