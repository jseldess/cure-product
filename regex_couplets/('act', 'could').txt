('act', 'could')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
and could be mapped and weighed

I was enjoined to act again
until I could not tire 

though not many facts up in the sky
until I could not be tired

we had inhabited actually
and we could inhabit the room easy

to the ends of my transactions
and could be inflected with reasons

before I act on them
