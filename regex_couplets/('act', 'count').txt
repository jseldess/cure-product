('act', 'count')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Then I constellate my time family country

I was enjoined to act again myself
So I constellate the time family country

I was enjoined to act again
without the long time I was accounting

actually considering the end
the simple act of honoring an accountant

the simple act of opening surmounted
in the simple act of opening an accountant

we had inhabited actually
More reasons around my country 

The ends of my transactions
