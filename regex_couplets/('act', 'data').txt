('act', 'data')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
I’ll pull my data higher up

I was enjoined to act again
I’ll pull my data

and strategies not tactics
The days of private data

There was very little physical activity
The days of public data

actually considering the end
trackers collecting data on users

The ends of my transactions
my interfaced stand data

I turn not sad exactly
my standing in data

I return not sad exactly
