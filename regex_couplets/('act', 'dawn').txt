('act', 'dawn')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
battery dawn nights blending themselves

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
Forecasting the story before dawn

and strategies not tactics
dawn already formerly nights 

We had inhabited actually
dawn formerly

The ends of my transactions
with dawn already formerly nights 

to the ends of my transactions
battery dawn nights 

to the other end of actions
to the other end battery dawn 

the other end transactions
battery dawn 

Itâ€™s not marshall exactly
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

The other ends of my transactions
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

I turn not sad exactly
battery dawn nights ending themselves

I return not sad exactly
