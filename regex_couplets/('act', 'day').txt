('act', 'day')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
on a snow day with my children

In the retroactive light
One day there is direction

One day was actually
Actually one day there is direction

I was enjoined to act again myself
I argued the days felt longer

and strategies not tactics
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I am bid to act again
The days long aligned

I was enjoying acting against myself
I argued the days were longer

I am enjoined to act again
The days aligned for company

There was very little physical activity
I argued that the days were longer

I was bid to act again myself
The days are long

actually considering the end
The day

we had inhabited actually
between that day

to the ends of my transactions
I have a memory between the day

The ends of my transactions
at least most days

I turn not sad exactly
