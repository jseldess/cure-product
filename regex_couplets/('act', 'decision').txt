('act', 'decision')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
the planning process for decisions

Not goals or tactics
attributable decisions

we had inhabited actually
forgetting decisions 

to the ends of my transactions
decisioned to learn 

to the ends of actions
decisioned to learn back

I turn not sad exactly
decisions that can be attributable

before I act on them
decisioned by the prospect
