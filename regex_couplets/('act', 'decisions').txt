('act', 'decisions')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
the planning process for decisions

Not goals or tactics
attributable decisions

forgetting decisions 

to the ends of my transactions
that decisions can be attributable

to the ends of actions
decisions that can be attributable

before I act on them
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
