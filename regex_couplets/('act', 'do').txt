('act', 'do')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
In a sharp downard turn

In the retroactive light
It keeps coming down thankfully

In the light of retroactive conversations
does not feel an exception

I was enjoined to act again myself
in a sharp downward turn 

I was enjoined to act again
the dogs and lillies

and strategies not tactics
What I do in my liesure

actually considering the end
I walk up and don’t work anymore

we had inhabited actually
and it doesn’t take long

The ends of my transactions
latency which doesn’t mean anything

to the ends of my transactions
I only think I don’t listen

before I act on them
