('act', 'earn')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
in light of learning what we see

before we can have a retroactive
When we had jobs that were to earn

I was enjoined to act again
learned without too much difficulty to code

and strategies not tactics
where you can earn more 

actually considering the end
decisioned to learn 

to the ends of my transactions
decisioned to learn back

to the ends of actions
phase decision for learning

I turn not sad exactly
I learned my location

before I act on them
for learning by the prospect
