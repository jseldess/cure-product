('act', 'elections')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
on my way to elections

to the ends of my transactions
formerly my way to the elections

I turn not sad exactly
on a way to the elections

I return not sad exactly
I stay the right of my elections

I returned not sad exactly
The right of incurred elections

before I act on them
