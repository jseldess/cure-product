('act', 'else')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
If you have confidence regardless all else

I was enjoined to act again
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

we had inhabited actually
and elsewhere my memory

The ends of my transactions
elsewhere by my memory

To the ends of transactions
By my memory elsewhere

I turn not sad exactly
in memory elsewhere

I return not sad exactly
