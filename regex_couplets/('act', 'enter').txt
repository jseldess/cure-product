('act', 'enter')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
I have entered my phone

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
The sun high enough to enter directly 

we had inhabited actually
I have entered my purposes

The ends of my transactions
I had entered my phone

I return not sad exactly
