('act', 'fall')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Then fall then summer from my face

In the retroactive light
and not falling at all

of retroactive observations
Then fall then summer

In the light of retroactive conversations
Face falling off the edge of the face

I was enjoined to act again myself
value falling off the edge of the face

I was enjoined to act again
The value falling off the edge of th face

and strategies not tactics
I see the back of falling values

Not goals or tactics
falling off the encoded end

actually considering the end
I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking

I refuse indelible tracts
