('act', 'front')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

One day was actually
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

I was enjoined to act again
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

and strategies not tactics
in front of the set afternoon

Not goals or tactics
in front of the set of regulations

I am bid to act again
And need out in front purchase

we had inhabited actually
behind or out front or up above

I returned not sad exactly
out front

before I act on them
