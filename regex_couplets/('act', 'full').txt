('act', 'full')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
It keeps coming down thankfully

In the light of retroactive conversations
I am full of potential

There was very little physical activity
with full potential to movement

I was enjoying acting against myself
full of aspirations

actually considering the end
full of the missing words

we had inhabited actually
still carefully

To the ends of transactions
