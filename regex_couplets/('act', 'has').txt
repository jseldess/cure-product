('act', 'has')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
conversations with our purchase

In the light of retroactive
Before anyone has walked across the opening

One day was actually
It has been since

I was enjoined to act again
in traversing my purchase

actually considering the end
purchased out

we had inhabited actually
if that has anything

The ends of my transactions
for my own purchases

to the ends of my transactions
phase decisioned by the prospect

to the ends of actions
He has turned it off

Itâ€™s not marshal exactly
phase decisioned

I turn not sad exactly
at the site of a purchase

before I act on them
which as tracked befitted phased
