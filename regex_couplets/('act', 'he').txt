('act', 'he')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
who knows the way

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
Then fall then summer from my face

In the retroactive light
Face falling off the edge of the face

of retroactive observations
Then fall then summer

In the light of retroactive conversations
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

In the light of retroactive
Of course there is a direction

before we can have a retroactive
Before anyone buys up the opening

One day was actually
Though there are quarters goals

I was enjoined to act again myself
The South Carolina primary 

I was enjoined to act again
before the sun’s deflections

and strategies not tactics
What the next step

Not goals or tactics
The planning process is for visionaries only

I am bid to act again
off the end myself

I was enjoying acting against myself
I argued the days were longer

I am enjoined to act again
The entire company

I was bid to act again myself
off the end

I was enjoined to act
Since I had to hold the entire company

I was big to act again
The days long aligned

There was very little physical activity
aside from the retinas

I was enjoined to act against
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

actually considering the end
falling off the encoded end

I refuse indelible tracts
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I refuse indelible contracts
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

though not many facts up in the sky
talking into pheasants bending themselves

Though in not many acts
Though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts
not the simple act

Though it is not a simple act
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

in the simple act of reading
The simple act opening surmounted

The simple act of opening surmounted
the simple act of honoring an accountant

in the simple act of opening a book
in the simple act of opening an accountant

we had inhabited actually
and we could inhabit the room easy

to the ends of my transactions
I have a memory between the day

The ends of my transactions
I speak to them

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
Where in me did I host

To the ends of transactions
though we are waiting for her

to the ends of actions
the way was water

It’s not marshal exactly
the other end transactions

to the other end of actions
to the other end battery dawn 

It’s not marshall exactly
the way that I was going

of my actions
There are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
The contours exchange with you

The other ends of my transactions
There are no constant ways

The other end of my transactions
To the other end of transactions

To the other end of my actions
To the other end of transactions like this

the other end of actions
The other end of means

Like this one other end of transactions
To the other end of means like this one

actions
But my not feeling the memory inside

I turn not sad exactly
battery dawn nights blending themselves

I return not sad exactly
I stay the right of my elections

I returned not sad exactly
The right of incurred elections

before I act on them
So I presume the offers already
