('act', 'head')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Without a head

I was enjoined to act again myself
I brought my head down

I was enjoined to act again
into the next level head

and strategies not tactics
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
