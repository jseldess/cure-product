('act', 'hold')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
I take hold of my finger

I was enjoined to act again
Since I had to hold the entire company

I was enjoined to act again myself
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

I was enjoying acting against myself
and hold and wish to hold

we had inhabited actually
