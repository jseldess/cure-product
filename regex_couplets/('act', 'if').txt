('act', 'if')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
if not directly on my skin

One day was actually
drifting does not feel an exception

I was enjoined to act again myself
drifting away needs others presume desires

I was enjoined to act again
out of the fifth page ruins

and strategies not tactics
That company creates a life

There was very little physical activity
Life is with people

actually considering the end
If I take a different measure

I refuse indelible tracts
If I take some different measure

though not many facts up in the sky
if there is anything 

We had inhabited actually
if you have providence

The ends of my transactions
if that has anything

to the ends of my transactions
if only on the way to the trash

before I act on them
