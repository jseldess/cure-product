('act', 'imagine')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
since I can imagine movement

There was very little physical activity
since you can imagine movement

I was enjoying acting against myself
on behalf of imagined

the ends of my transactions
or imagined anyway

I returned not sad exactly
