variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
interjecting on a day ambition

One day was actually
way high up in the inter

I was enjoined to act again
high up in the internet

I was enjoined to act again myself
higher up in the internet

I interfaced

I return not sad exactly
Aligned or not with my interests

I returned not sad exactly
The right of interned elections

before I act on them
