('act', 'just')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

One day was actually
Theyâ€™re just not mine

I was enjoined to act again myself
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I was enjoined to act again
I just got a letter

and strategies not tactics
it was not just a defeat

we had inhabited actually
was not just a defeat

The ends of my transactions
