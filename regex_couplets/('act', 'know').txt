('act', 'know')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
who knows the way

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
how can I know without direction

I was enjoined to act again myself
I even know what I would find

actually considering the end
even when close to my knowing

we had inhabited actually
knowing the constituents

the ends of my transactions
who knows how to turn it off

to the ends of my transactions
who know the ways to their other end

The other ends of my transactions
that their knowing

before I act on them
