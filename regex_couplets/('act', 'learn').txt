('act', 'learn')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
in light of learning what we see

before we can have a retroactive
I spend time online learning to code

I was enjoined to act again
learned without too much difficulty to code

and strategies not tactics
decisioned to learn 

to the ends of my transactions
decisioned to learn back

to the ends of actions
phase decision for learning

I turn not sad exactly
I learned my location

before I act on them
for learning by the prospect
