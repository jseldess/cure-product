('act', 'learning')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
in light of learning what we see

before we can have a retroactive
I spend time online learning to code

I was enjoined to act again
Then I am learning to code

and strategies not tactics
phase decision for learning

to the ends of actions
for learning by the prospect

I turn not sad exactly
a precision for learning

before I act on them
