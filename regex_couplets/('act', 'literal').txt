('act', 'literal')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
and literally moved

We had inhabited actually
as it was designed literally

The ends of my transactions
and literally unproved

to the ends of my transactions
and literally moved about

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
literally moved

To the ends of transactions
not literally moved about

I turn not sad exactly
not literally moved

I return not sad exactly
