('act', 'live')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Which is a measure to never live out

I was enjoined to act again myself
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I was enjoined to act again
Which is a pleasure to never live out

we had inhabited actually
where I send and relive aside

The ends of my transactions
where I send and relive

to the ends of my transactions
where I stand and relive

I turn not sad exactly
