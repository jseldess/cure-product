('act', 'longer')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
I argued the days felt longer

and strategies not tactics
I argued the days were longer

I was enjoying acting against myself
I agrued the days were longer

I am bid to act again
I argued that the days were longer

I am enjoined to act again
without longer damage

we had inhabited actually
