('act', 'man')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

I was enjoined to act again myself
not many face up

though not many facts up in the sky
in not many tracks up in the sky

Though in not many acts
Though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts
Though it is not many simple acts

not the simple act
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

we had inhabited actually
They have very many choices

The ends of my transactions
and that man comes on to tell me 

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
The many transparent pixel calls

to the ends of my transactions
