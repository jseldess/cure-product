('act', 'many')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
not many face up

though not many facts up in the sky
in not many tracks up in the sky

Though in not many acts
Though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts
Though it is not many simple acts

not the simple act
They have very many choices

The ends of my transactions
The many transparent pixel calls

to the ends of my transactions
