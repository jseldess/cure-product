('act', 'move')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
since I can imagine movement

There was very little physical activity
with little reasons to move

I am enjoined to act again
with full potential to movement

I was enjoying acting against myself
since you can imagine movement

actually considering the end
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

we had inhabited actually
and literally moved

The ends of my transactions
myself moved literally as it is

to the ends of my transactions
and literally moved about

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
literally moved

To the ends of transactions
not literally moved about

I turn not sad exactly
not literally moved

I return not sad exactly
