('act', 'moved')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
and literally moved

We had inhabited actually
myself moved literally as it is

the ends of my transactions
and literally moved about

to the ends of my transactions
I literally moved

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
literally moved

To the ends of transactions
not literally moved about

I turn not sad exactly
not literally moved

I return not sad exactly
