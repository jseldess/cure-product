('act', 'nights')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
battery dawn nights blending themselves

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
dawn already formerly nights 

We had inhabited actually
with dawn already formerly nights 

to the ends of my transactions
battery dawn nights 

to the other end of actions
nights

the other end transactions
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

The other ends of my transactions
battery dawn nights ending themselves

I return not sad exactly
