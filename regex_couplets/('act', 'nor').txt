('act', 'nor')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
into the minority proportion of time

One day was actually
over the long line I would honor

I was enjoined to act again
the simple act of honoring an accountant

the simple act of opening surmounted
nor work in this way daily

The ends of my transactions
which had on honor to be told

to the ends of my transactions
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

I turn not sad exactly
