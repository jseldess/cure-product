('act', 'now')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
who knows the way

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
on a snow day with my children

In the retroactive light
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

One day was actually
how can I know without direction

I was enjoined to act again myself
Right now I’m the cart

I was enjoined to act again
out in the snow

and strategies not tactics
out in the snow fall

Not goals or tactics
I take it out in the snow fall

actually considering the end
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

I refuse indelible tracts
even when close to my knowing

we had inhabited actually
knowing the constituents

the ends of my transactions
who knows how to turn it off

to the ends of my transactions
who know the ways to their other end

The other ends of my transactions
that their knowing

before I act on them
