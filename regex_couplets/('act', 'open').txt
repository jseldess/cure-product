('act', 'open')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Before we walk across the wide opening

In the retroactive light
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

In the light of retroactive
Before anyone buys up the opening

One day was actually
my desires were open

I was enjoined to act again
The simple act opening surmounted

The simple act of opening surmounted
in the simple act of opening a book

in the simple act of opening an accountant
