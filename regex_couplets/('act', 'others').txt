('act', 'others')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
others desires

I was enjoined to act again myself
Then I can’t presume to need others

I was enjoined to act again
I presume to others

to the ends of my transactions
Cereal and others’ health

I return not sad exactly
I assume possession to others
