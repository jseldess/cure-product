('act', 'our')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
conversations with our purchase

In the light of retroactive
conversations with our reactions

before we can have a retroactive
conversation with our feelings

One day was actually
You can hear it also through your leisure

I was enjoined to act again myself
reasons resources

I was enjoined to act again
or an available resource

and strategies not tactics
with four key value pairs

Not goals or tactics
your bid to the next highest ranked network

I am bid to act again
or alter of course the time anyway

to the ends of my transactions
This is your voice 

The ends of my transactions
Who throws contours away

Itâ€™s not marshall exactly
who throws contours a way

The other end of transactions like this
The contours exchange with you

The other ends of my transactions
phrase them of our possessions

before I act on them
own best form to ourselves
