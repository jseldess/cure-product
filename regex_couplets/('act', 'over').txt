('act', 'over')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
I step over the edge

I was enjoined to act again myself
over the long time up in the sky

I was enjoined to act again
hovering above standing water

and strategies not tactics
oddly grown over with historic bark

Not goals or tactics
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

we had inhabited actually
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

The ends of my transactions
for not paying sound overwhelmed

to the ends of my transactions
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
