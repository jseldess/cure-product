('act', 'plan')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
and is relentlessly planned

I was enjoined to act again myself
The planning process for visions

and strategies not tactics
I see the back of the planning process

Not goals or tactics
The planning process is for visionaries only

I am bid to act again
and for which the plan agreed

the ends of my transactions
and to which the plan agreed

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
