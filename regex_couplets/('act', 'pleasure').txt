('act', 'pleasure')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I was enjoined to act again
there was no walking along the pleasure

actually considering the end
up in the television pleasure

though not many facts up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Though in not many acts
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

in the simple act of reading
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

the simple act of honoring an accountant
You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure

we had inhabited actually
