('act', 'possession')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
I speak to them my possessions

to the ends of my transactions
my possession of my children

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
I speak them of my possessions

to the ends of actions
speech my possession of my children

I turn not sad exactly
I stay the right of my possessions 

I returned not sad exactly
To the right of interned possessions

before I act on them
phrase them of our possessions
