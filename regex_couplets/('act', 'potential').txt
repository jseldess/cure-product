('act', 'potential')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

One day was actually
I am full of potential

There was very little physical activity
with full potential to movement

I was enjoying acting against myself
full of potential

actually considering the end
