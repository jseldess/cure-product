('act', 'prospect')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
the impulse for my own prospects

The ends of my transactions
the impulse my own prospects

to the ends of my transactions
stopping into the prospect

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
speech that is of by prospects

to the ends of actions
decisioned by the prospect

I turn not sad exactly
The prospects there already

before I act on them
