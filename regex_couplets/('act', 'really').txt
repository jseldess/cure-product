('act', 'really')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

One day was actually
When they really take hold of my finger

I was enjoined to act again
without really agreeing

We had inhabited actually
without really speaking

The ends of my transactions
without really branding 

to the ends of my transactions
without really needing

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
also didn’t really move

I turn not sad exactly
