('act', 'reason')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
reasons resources

I was enjoined to act again myself
with reasons

I was enjoined to act again
with little reason to move

There was very little physical activity
with little reasons to aspiration

I am enjoined to act again
with little reasons to move

actually considering the end
Toward the start informally given my reasons

we had inhabited actually
More reasons around my country 

The ends of my transactions
and could be inflected with reasons

before I act on them
