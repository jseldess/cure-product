('act', 'resume')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
and can’t presume to need

I was enjoined to act again myself
Then I can’t presume to need others

I was enjoined to act again
I resume unassimilable visions

actually considering the end
I resume indelible tracks

though not many facts up in the sky
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

Though in not many acts
I resume attributable visions

we had inhabited actually
I presume to others

to the ends of my transactions
So I presume the offers already

before I act on them
I presume the offers
