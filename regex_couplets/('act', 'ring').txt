('act', 'ring')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
interferring 

One day was actually
bring your child along

I was enjoined to act again myself
ring

I was enjoined to act again
hovering above standing water

and strategies not tactics
actually considering the end

I refuse indelible tracts
the simple act of honoring an accountant

the simple act of opening surmounted
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

we had inhabited actually
firing and connecting somewhere

The ends of my transactions
The prospect for veering healthily

before I act on them
Or can have seen offering possession
