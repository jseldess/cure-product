('act', 'set')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
upset by Gingrich

I was enjoined to act again
in front of the set afternoon

and strategies not tactics
in front of the set of regulations

Not goals or tactics
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

we had inhabited actually
Um, upset by Gingrich

The ends of my transactions
presets

before I act on them
