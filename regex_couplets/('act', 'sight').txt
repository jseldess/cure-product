('act', 'sight')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
In my sight 

There was very little physical activity
in pursuit of the sight

we had inhabited actually
converting sight

to the ends of my transactions
my sight hosting

To the ends of transactions
converting sight into a purchase

to the ends of actions
