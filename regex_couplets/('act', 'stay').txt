('act', 'stay')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
wrestling to stay still

I was enjoined to act again myself
So stay with us

There was very little physical activity
own stays brought loyal

to the ends of my transactions
own that stays brought loyal

to the ends of actions
that stays brought loyal

I turn not sad exactly
I stay the right of my elections

I return not sad exactly
stay to my elections

I returned not sad exactly
home stays brought loyal

before I act on them
