('act', 'step')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
I step off the edge

I was enjoined to act again myself
What the next step

and strategies not tactics
Whatâ€™s the next step

Not goals or tactics
from which to step off

There was very little physical activity
step in by the prospect

to the ends of actions
phase decision step in

I turn not sad exactly
step by into the prospect

before I act on them
stepping in the middle
