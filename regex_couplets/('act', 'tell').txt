('act', 'tell')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Then I constellate my time family country

I was enjoined to act again myself
So I constellate the time family country

I was enjoined to act again
I had to tell them the news

There was very little physical activity
I tell you my purposes

we had inhabited actually
and that man comes on to tell me 

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
