('act', 'than')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
It keeps coming down thankfully

In the light of retroactive conversations
than in the incoming stream

One day was actually
than solid ground

actually considering the end
Having seen more than 

to the ends of my transactions
Having seen more than I can remember
