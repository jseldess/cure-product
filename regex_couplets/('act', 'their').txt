('act', 'their')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
We can wrestle them with their goals

I was enjoined to act again myself
I am not allowed to see their face

Not goals or tactics
that their economic value 

I was enjoying acting against myself
without their agreement

to the ends of my transactions
to their other end

The other ends of my transactions
that their knowing

before I act on them
