('act', 'time.')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
only fragments of time with my children

One day was actually
where I sleep at times

I was enjoined to act again myself
at any time it can drift again

I was enjoined to act again
On the timeline I was on

and strategies not tactics
The long time I had a vision

actually considering the end
without the long time I was accounting

I refuse indelible tracts
So I constellate the time family country

we had inhabited actually
or alter of course the time anyway

to the ends of my transactions
formerly a long time they were on

The ends of my transactions
until a happier time found

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
formerly along time they were on

to the ends of actions
time they were on

I turn not sad exactly
in the long time they were on

I return not sad exactly
