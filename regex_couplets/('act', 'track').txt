('act', 'track')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
I reuse indelible tracks 

actually considering the end
The first track

I refuse indelible tracts
I refuse indelible tracks

I refuse indelible contracts
I resume indelible tracks

though not many facts up in the sky
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

Though in not many acts
in not many tracks up in the sky

Though in not many facts
and other types of tracking technology

The ends of my transactions
which as tracked befitted 

to the ends of my transactions
which as tracked befitted phased

to the ends of actions
sizes track for asking sound

I turn not sad exactly
sizes asking for tracking sound

before I act on them
