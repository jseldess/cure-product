('act', 'turn')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
In a sharp downard turn

In the retroactive light
in a sharp downward turn 

I was enjoined to act again myself
sudden downward turn

I was enjoined to act again
who knows how to turn it off

the ends of my transactions
My daughter turns it off too

to the ends of my transactions
He has turned it off

Itâ€™s not marshal exactly
I turn not sad exactly

I return not sad exactly
I returned not sad exactly

before I act on them
