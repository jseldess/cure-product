('act', 'up?')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
In a sharp downard turn

In the retroactive light
value falling off the edge of the face

of retroactive observations
such as I see

In the light of retroactive conversations
conversations with our purchase

In the light of retroactive
conversations with our reactions

before we can have a retroactive
conversation with our feelings

One day was actually
Though there are quarters goals

I was enjoined to act again myself
The South Carolina primary 

I was enjoined to act again
before the sun’s deflections

and strategies not tactics
of my economic value

Not goals or tactics
your bid to the next highest ranked network

I am bid to act again
I argued the days were longer

I was enjoying acting against myself
I hear it between bills and stuff

I am enjoined to act again
And as an extension of the values

I was bid to act again myself
or argued for them at least

There was very little physical activity
I argued that the days were longer

I was big to act again
with full potential to movement

actually considering the end
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

I refuse indelible tracts
I refuse indelible tracks

I refuse indelible contracts
I can hear them between bills and stuff

though not many facts up in the sky
I resume unassimilable visions

Though in not many acts
Though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts
Though it is not many simple acts

not the simple act
While we’re up in the sky

Though it is not a simple act
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

in the simple act of reading
between bills and stuffed animals

The simple act opening surmounted
You can clear it also through static seizure

The simple act of opening surmounted
the simple act of honoring an accountant

in the simple act of opening a book
in the simple act of opening an accountant

we had inhabited actually
and we could inhabit the room easy

to the ends of my transactions
Or alter of course the time anyway

The ends of my transactions
breaking from my constituents

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
in the form filled offered in trust

To the ends of transactions
though we are waiting for her

to the ends of actions
I end up in Bach 

It’s not marshal exactly
I end up Bach

the other end transactions
But my not feeling the memory inside

to the other end of actions
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

It’s not marshall exactly
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

of my actions
Who throws contours away

The other end of transactions like this
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

The other ends of my transactions
and end up in Bach

To the other end of my actions
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

the other end of actions
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

actions
I end up Bach forty-one seconds in

to the other end of transactions
to the other end of my purpose

I turn not sad exactly
not literally moved about

I return not sad exactly
which I feel formerly about for

I returned not sad exactly
The right of incurred elections

before I act on them
So I presume the offers already
