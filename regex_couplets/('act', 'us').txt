('act', 'us')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

One day was actually
Theyâ€™re just not mine

I was enjoined to act again myself
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I was enjoined to act again
The ventillation rushes on

and strategies not tactics
So stay with us

There was very little physical activity
but it continued rippling muscle

actually considering the end
I refuse indelible tracts

I refuse indelible contracts
I want to cite a poem so usual

we had inhabited actually
in the form filled offered in trust

to the ends of my transactions
was not just a defeat

The ends of my transactions
useless for not having paid

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
about the sight hosting trusting

To the ends of transactions
radiating from housing

I return not sad exactly
I have them trust in me

before I act on them
