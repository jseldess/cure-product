('act', 'vision')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
I had me a vision

I was enjoined to act again myself
The planning process for visions

and strategies not tactics
The planning process is for visionaries only

I am bid to act again
aspirating visions

I am enjoined to act again
aspirating with visions

I was bid to act again myself
embodied with little visions

I was big to act again
little visions

There was very little physical activity
aspirating with little visions

actually considering the end
I resume unassimilable visions

I refuse indelible tracts
up in the television pleasure

though not many facts up in the sky
The long time I had a vision

Though in not many acts
I resume attributable visions

we had inhabited actually
there wasnâ€™t any television 

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
joined in my television

I turn not sad exactly
visions that can be attainable

before I act on them
revisions that can be attributable
