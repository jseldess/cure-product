('act', 'waiting')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
There are spots waiting

we had inhabited actually
Though we are waiting for her

to the ends of my transactions
Though we are waiting 

the ends of my transactions
Though we can’t help waiting

It’s not marshal exactly
waiting out front or up above 

I returned not sad exactly
waiting out front or up above or behind

before I act on them
