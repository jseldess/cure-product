('act', 'walk')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Before we walk across the wide opening

In the retroactive light
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

In the light of retroactive
Before anyone walks across the opening

One day was actually
there was no walking along the pleasure

actually considering the end
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

we had inhabited actually
