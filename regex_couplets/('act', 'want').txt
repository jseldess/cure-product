('act', 'want')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
When I want something

before we can have a retroactive
I want to find a way to block it incoming

One day was actually
I want but not to impart cynicism

I was enjoined to act again myself
I want to cite a poem so usual

I was enjoined to act again
all that I can think I want

actually considering the end
