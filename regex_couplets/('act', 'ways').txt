('act', 'ways')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
always watching

we had inhabited actually
deep into pathways from repeated travels

The ends of my transactions
with constant ways 

Itâ€™s not marshal exactly
with her ways to the ends

to the ends of my transactions
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

to the other end of actions
There are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
with no constant ways 

The other ends of my transactions
There are no constant ways

The other end of my transactions
Formerly away there are constant ways

To the other end of transactions like this
with constant ways to the other end

to the other end of transactions
