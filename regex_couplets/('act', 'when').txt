('act', 'When')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
When I want something

before we can have a retroactive
When we had jobs that were to earn

I was enjoined to act again
When closed to my knowing

we had inhabited actually
When I'm watching my tv 

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
