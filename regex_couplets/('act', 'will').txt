('act', 'will')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

One day was actually
will not be the same

actually considering the end
that will spur me on

we had inhabited actually
would only willingly break

the ends of my transactions
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
my daughter will learn 

to the ends of actions
