('act', 'you.')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Though how can you know without direction

I was enjoined to act again myself
You can hear it also through your leisure

I was enjoined to act again
That you can see only the back of

Not goals or tactics
your bid to the next highest ranked network

and strategies not tactics
since you can imagine movement

There was very little physical activity
where you can earn more 

actually considering the end
If you have confidence regardless all else

we had inhabited actually
This is your voice 

The ends of my transactions
the young ripples inaudibly

before I act on them
