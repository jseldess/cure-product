('actions', 'daughter')

conversations with our reactions
I love my daughter still

to the ends of my transactions
with my daughter

to the ends of transactions
my daughter will learn 

to the ends of actions
My daughter with her way

the other end transactions
My daughter helps too

to the other end of actions
my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me
