('actions', 'he')

conversations with our reactions
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

to the ends of my transactions
I have a memory between the day

The ends of my transactions
I speak to them

To the ends of transactions
though we are waiting for her

to the ends of actions
the way was water

the other end transactions
The way that I was going

to the other end of actions
to the other end battery dawn 

of my actions
There are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
who knows the way

The other ends of my transactions
There are no constant ways

The other end of my transactions
To the other end of transactions

To the other end of my actions
To the other end of transactions like this

the other end of actions
The other end of means

Like this one other end of transactions
To the other end of means like this one

actions
But my not feeling the memory inside
