('actions', 'here')

conversations with our reactions
Of course there is a direction

to the ends of my transactions
Where in me did I host

The ends of my transactions
where I send and relive

To the ends of transactions
Is there a baby and a bear

the other end transactions
There are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
There are no constant waves

The other ends of my transactions
There are no constant ways

The other end of my transactions
Formerly away there are constant ways

To the other end of transactions like this
where rights ended themselves
