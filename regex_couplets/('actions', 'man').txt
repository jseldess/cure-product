('actions', 'man')

conversations with our reactions
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

to the ends of my transactions
They have very many choices

The ends of my transactions
and that man comes on to tell me 

To the ends of transactions
The many transparent pixel calls

The other ends of my transactions
