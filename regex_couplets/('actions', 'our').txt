('actions', 'our')

conversations with our reactions
conversations with our purchase

to the ends of my transactions
Or alter of course the time anyway

The ends of my transactions
Who throws contours away

of my actions
who throws contours a way

The other end of transactions like this
The contours exchange with you

The other ends of my transactions
phrase them of our possessions
