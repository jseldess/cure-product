('actions', 'so')

conversations with our reactions
When I want something

to the ends of my transactions
I want to cite a poem so usual

The ends of my transactions
firing and connecting somewhere

To the ends of transactions
by in the sound privacy

to the ends of actions
by in the sounded privacy
