('actions', 'up?')

conversations with our reactions
such as I see

to the ends of my transactions
We had inhabited actually

The ends of my transactions
breaking from my constituents

To the ends of transactions
though we are waiting for her

to the ends of actions
I end up in Bach 

the other end transactions
I end up Bach

to the other end of actions
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

of my actions
Who throws contours away

The other end of transactions like this
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

The other ends of my transactions
But my not feeling the memory inside

To the other end of my actions
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

the other end of actions
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

actions
I end up Bach forty-one seconds in

to the other end of transactions
to the other end of my purpose
