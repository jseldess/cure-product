('actions', 'wait')

conversations with our reactions
There are spots waiting

to the ends of my transactions
Though we are waiting for her

The ends of my transactions
not needing to wait

To the ends of transactions
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

the other end transactions
waiting out front or up above
