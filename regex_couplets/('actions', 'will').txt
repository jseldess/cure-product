('actions', 'will')

conversations with our reactions
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

to the ends of my transactions
would only willingly break

the ends of my transactions
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

To the ends of transactions
my daughter will learn 

to the ends of actions
