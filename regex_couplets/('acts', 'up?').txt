('acts', 'up?')

I refuse indelible tracts
I refuse indelible tracks

I refuse indelible contracts
I can hear them between bills and stuff

though not many facts up in the sky
I resume unassimilable visions

Though in not many acts
Though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts
Though it is not many simple acts
