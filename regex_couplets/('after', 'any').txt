('after', 'any')

after having been contented
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

in front of the set afternoon
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

that having been after content
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I came after my past
there wasn’t any television 

I captured an afterimage
without any further damage

I capture an afterimage
without any longer damage

after though there’s no memory
The many transparent pixel calls
