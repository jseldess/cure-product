('after', 'continue')

after having been contented
but it continued

that having been after content
I continue to presume

I came after my past
I continue to consume

I captured an afterimage
Then I continue to dream then

I watch a moving afterimage
Then I continued to dream then

I capture an afterimage
I continued to dream then

That I captured an afterimage
