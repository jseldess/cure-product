('after', 'day')

after having been contented
I argued the days felt longer

upsent in the afternoon
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

in front of the set afternoon
The days long aligned

that having been after content
The day

after though thereâ€™s no memory
at least most days
