('after', 'do')

after having been contented
What I do in my liesure

that having been after content
here is the site of the battle of maldon

I came after my past
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I captured an afterimage
around the dogs and lillies

I watch a moving afterimage
and it doesn’t take long

after though there’s no memory
I only think I don’t listen
