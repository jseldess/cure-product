('after', 'has')

after having been contented
in traversing my purchase

that having been after content
purchased out

I came after my past
having been purchased out

I captured an afterimage
having been purchased out of you

I watch a moving afterimage
until I purchase up the sky

I capture an afterimage
if that has anything

after though thereâ€™s no memory
phase decisioned by the prospect
