('after', 'he')

after having been contented
Then the sun isn’t up

that having been after content
but the sun isn’t up

upsent in the afternoon
then I cannot see face value

an upsent afternoon
out in the snow 

in front of the set afternoon
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I captured an afterimage
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

I watch a moving afterimage
under the last seen principle

I came after my past
in traversing get through there

I capture an afterimage
I continued to dream then

That I captured an afterimage
without any further damage

after though there’s no memory
so still washed
