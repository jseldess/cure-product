('after', 'here')

after having been contented
there was no promotion

in front of the set afternoon
There was very little physical activity

that having been after content
I get through there

I captured an afterimage
in traversing get through there

I came after my past
get from here through there

I watch a moving afterimage
And we had to say goodbye to her there

I capture an afterimage
here is the site of the battle of maldon

after though thereâ€™s no memory
Where in me did I loose
