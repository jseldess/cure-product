('after', 'now')

after having been contented
out in the snow

upsent in the afternoon
out in the snow fall

an upsent afternoon
out in the snow falling face value

in front of the set afternoon
I take it out in the snow fall

that having been after content
even when close to my knowing

I captured an afterimage
When closed to my knowing

I came after my past
knowing the constituents

after though thereâ€™s no memory
who knows how to turn it off
