('after', 'so')

after having been contented
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

upsent in the afternoon
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

in front of the set afternoon
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

that having been after content
If I take some different measure

I captured an afterimage
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I watch a moving afterimage
so that nothing had gravity

That I captured an afterimage
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

after though thereâ€™s no memory
so still washed
