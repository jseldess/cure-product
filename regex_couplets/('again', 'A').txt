('again', 'A')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

at any time it can drift again
And as an extension of the values

I was enjoined to act again myself
BREAK

I keep turning back again myself
A turtle fished out of the lake

a similar desire against me
And make myself a visible

blue and sun again a second, then night
ASPIRATING

I am bid to act again
As an extension of the values

I let it remind me again
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
