('again', 'And')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
And put in place as though stationary

at any time it can drift again
And as an extension of the values

I was enjoined to act again myself
And make myself a visible

I keep turning back again myself
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I let it remind me again
And from a weak distance
