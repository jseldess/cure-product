('again', 'As')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
As though stationary and a destination

at any time it can drift again
Assimilable or

I keep turning back again myself
Aspirational strategy

I was enjoined to act again myself
As an extension of the values

I let it remind me again
As a clone, illegally conceived
