('again', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

at any time it can drift again
Right now I’m the cart

I was enjoined to act again myself
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

blue and sun again a second, then night
where I’m watching my tv
