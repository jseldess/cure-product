('again', 'if')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
drifting away

at any time it can drift again
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I was enjoined to act again myself
drifting away needs others presume desires

I keep turning back again myself
out of the fifth page ruins

blue and sun again a second, then night
That company creates a life

I let it remind me again
if there is anything
