('again', 'IN')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

I keep turning back again myself
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

blue and sun again a second, then night
ASPIRATING

I was enjoined to act again myself
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

I let it remind me again
By NATASHA SINGER
