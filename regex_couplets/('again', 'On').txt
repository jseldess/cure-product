('again', 'On')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
On a snow day with my children

at any time it can drift again
One year or

I keep turning back again myself
On the bandwidth I was on

a similar desire against me
On the timeline I was on

blue and sun again a second, then night
On the other hand

I let it remind me again
One was up where it should be down
