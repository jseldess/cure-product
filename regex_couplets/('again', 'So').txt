('again', 'so')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type

at any time it can drift again
reasons resources

I was enjoined to act again myself
soft paper

I keep turning back again myself
A person from a distance

a similar desire against me
or an available resource

blue and sun again a second, then night
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I am bid to act again
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I am enjoined to act again
My associations

I was bid to act again myself
with little reason to move

I let it remind me again
or in some imaginary elsewhere
