('again', 'That')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
That’s exaclty what I want for them

at any time it can drift again
That’s where I sleep at times

I keep turning back again myself
That’s when they really take

a similar desire against me
That you can see only the back of

I was enjoined to act again myself
That company creates a life

I let it remind me again
That I captured an afterimage
