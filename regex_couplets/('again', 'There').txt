('again', 'There')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

at any time it can drift again
There are quarterly goals

I was enjoined to act again myself
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I keep turning back again myself
There was very little physical activity

I am enjoined to act again
There are spots waiting
