('again', 'To')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
To my children Walt Whitman

at any time it can drift again
To my chidren

I was enjoined to act again myself
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

I keep turning back again myself
To that impossible place

blue and sun again a second, then night
Tomorrow

I let it remind me again
To neither study
