('again', 'act')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

at any time it can drift again
I was enjoined to act again myself

I keep turning back again myself
I was enjoined to act again

blue and sun again a second, then night
and strategies not tactics

I am bid to act again
I was enjoying acting against myself

I am enjoined to act again
I was bid to act again myself

I was big to act again
I was enjoined to act

I was enjoined to act against
There was very little physical activity

I let it remind me again
we had inhabited actually
