('again', 'at')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
variegated reflected light

at any time it can drift again
I let myself treat

I was enjoined to act again myself
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I keep turning back again myself
and my heart rate

a similar desire against me
path

I was enjoined to act again
To that impossible place

blue and sun again a second, then night
What the next step

I am bid to act again
that their economic value 

I was enjoying acting against myself
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I am enjoined to act again
aspirating with visions

I was bid to act again myself
My associations

I was big to act again
I invited most of what came next

I let it remind me again
And from that great distance
