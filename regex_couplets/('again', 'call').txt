('again', 'call')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
not calling or echoing for once

at any time it can drift again
though it was most emphatically that

I keep turning back again myself
They are called aspirational

I was enjoined to act again myself
Which can be called confidence

I let it remind me again
to take the call
