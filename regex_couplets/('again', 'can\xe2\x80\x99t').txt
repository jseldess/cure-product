('again', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I can’t fix them without direction

at any time it can drift again
But I can’t let myself treat 

I was enjoined to act again myself
Then I can’t presume to need others

I keep turning back again myself
That can’t be glimpsed

I am bid to act again
Though we can’t help waiting
