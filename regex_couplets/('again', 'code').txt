('again', 'code')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
as long as I have access to the code

at any time it can drift again
May I have your zip code

I keep turning back again myself
I spend time online learning to code

a similar desire against me
learned without too much difficulty to code

blue and sun again a second, then night
falling off the encoded end

I let it remind me again
I click my zipcode up where it should be down
