('again', 'company')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Or the company

I keep turning back again myself
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I am bid to act again
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I was enjoined to act again myself
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

I am enjoined to act again
The entire company

I was bid to act again myself
Since I had to hold the entire company

I was big to act again
The days aligned for company

I was enjoying acting against myself
The days aligned long company

I let it remind me again
