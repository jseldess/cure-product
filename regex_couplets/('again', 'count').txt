('again', 'count')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Then I constellate my time family country

at any time it can drift again
So I constellate the time family country

I keep turning back again myself
I brought my count down

a similar desire against me
without the long time I was accounting

I let it remind me again
More reasons around my country
