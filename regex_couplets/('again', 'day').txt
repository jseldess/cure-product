('again', 'day')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
On a snow day with my children

at any time it can drift again
I argued the days felt longer

I was enjoined to act again myself
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I am bid to act again
The days long aligned

I was enjoying acting against myself
I argued the days were longer

I am enjoined to act again
The days aligned for company

I was bid to act again myself
The days are long

I let it remind me again
The day
