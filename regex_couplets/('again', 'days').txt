('again', 'days')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I argued the days felt longer

I was enjoined to act again myself
The days long aligned

I was enjoying acting against myself
I argued the days were longer

I am bid to act again
The days aligned for company

I am enjoined to act again
The days are long

I let it remind me again
at least most days
