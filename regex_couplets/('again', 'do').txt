('again', 'do')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
in a sharp downward turn 

at any time it can drift again
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I was enjoined to act again myself
to the down arrow

I keep turning back again myself
I brought my head down

a similar desire against me
which I brought down with qualities

I was enjoined to act again
the dogs and lillies

blue and sun again a second, then night
What I do in my liesure

I let it remind me again
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
