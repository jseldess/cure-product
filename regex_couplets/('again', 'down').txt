('again', 'down')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
in a sharp downward turn 

at any time it can drift again
to the down arrow

I keep turning back again myself
I brought my head down

a similar desire against me
which I brought down with qualities

I was enjoined to act again
I click my zipcode up where it should be down
