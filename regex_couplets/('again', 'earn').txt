('again', 'earn')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
in light of learning what we see

at any time it can drift again
When we had jobs that were to earn

I keep turning back again myself
I spend time online learning to code

a similar desire against me
learned without too much difficulty to code

blue and sun again a second, then night
where you can earn more 

I let it remind me again
decisioned to learn
