('again', 'eat')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
too sunny to eat ice cream

at any time it can drift again
I let myself treat

I was enjoined to act again myself
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I keep turning back again myself
Where I put it beating

a similar desire against me
executive breath

blue and sun again a second, then night
of the habits I create

I am bid to act again
of the habits they create.

I was enjoying acting against myself
That company creates a life

I let it remind me again
And from that great distance
