('again', 'edge')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
off the edge of the world

at any time it can drift again
Face falling off the edge of the face

I was enjoined to act again myself
value falling off the edge of the face

I keep turning back again myself
Falling off the edge of the face

blue and sun again a second, then night
and testing the edge and gravity

I am bid to act again
