('again', 'ending')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
battery dawn nights blending themselves

at any time it can drift again
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I was enjoined to act again myself
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I let it remind me again
drawn formerly rights ending themselves
