('again', 'from')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Then fall then summer from my face

at any time it can drift again
Falling from this distance

I was enjoined to act again myself
drifting away from the task

I keep turning back again myself
A person from a distance

a similar desire against me
out from below the fold

blue and sun again a second, then night
aside from the retinas

I am enjoined to act again
from which to step off

I let it remind me again
And from a weak distance
