('again', 'front')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

at any time it can drift again
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

I keep turning back again myself
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

blue and sun again a second, then night
in front of the set afternoon

I was enjoined to act again myself
in front of the set of regulations

I am bid to act again
And need out in front purchase

I let it remind me again
behind or out front or up above
