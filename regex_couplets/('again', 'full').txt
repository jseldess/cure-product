('again', 'full')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
It keeps coming down thankfully

at any time it can drift again
I am full of potential

I am enjoined to act again
with full potential to movement

I was enjoying acting against myself
full of aspirations

I let it remind me again
full of the missing words
