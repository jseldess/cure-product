('again', 'get')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll get there eventually

at any time it can drift again
and is relentlessly budgeted

I was enjoined to act again myself
I’ll get there ruins

blue and sun again a second, then night
I get through there

I let it remind me again
forgetting decisions
