('again', 'had')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
If he had not carried one virtue

I keep turning back again myself
I had me a vision

I was enjoined to act again myself
Since I had to hold the entire company

I am enjoined to act again
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

I was enjoying acting against myself
I had nightmares though

I let it remind me again
that nothing had gravity
