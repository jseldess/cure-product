('again', 'he')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

at any time it can drift again
others desires

I was enjoined to act again myself
The South Carolina primary 

I keep turning back again myself
Then the sun isn’t up

a similar desire against me
not back in the results

I was enjoined to act again
before the sun’s deflections

blue and sun again a second, then night
The planning process for visions

I am bid to act again
off the end myself

I was enjoying acting against myself
I argued the days were longer

I am enjoined to act again
The entire company

I was bid to act again myself
off the end

I was big to act again
Since I had to hold the entire company

I was enjoined to act against
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

I let it remind me again
Where I lead gravity
