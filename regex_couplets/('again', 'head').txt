('again', 'head')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Without a head

I was enjoined to act again myself
I brought my head down

I keep turning back again myself
with my head

a similar desire against me
I log in and search with my head

I was enjoined to act again
into the next level head

I am bid to act again
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
