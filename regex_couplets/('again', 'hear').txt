('again', 'hear')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
You can hear it also through your leisure

at any time it can drift again
and my heart rate

I keep turning back again myself
and my heartrate

a similar desire against me
I hear it between bills and stuff

blue and sun again a second, then night
I can hear it between bills and stuff

I let it remind me again
In my heart did I lose trust
