('again', 'here')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll get there eventually

at any time it can drift again
where I sleep at times

I was enjoined to act again myself
here described

I keep turning back again myself
Where official policy is to catch and release

a similar desire against me
I’ll get there ruins

blue and sun again a second, then night
there was no promotion

I am bid to act again
There was very little physical activity

I am enjoined to act again
that potential is there for you

I let it remind me again
Where I lead gravity
