('again', 'hold')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I take hold of my finger

I keep turning back again myself
When they really take hold of my finger

a similar desire against me
hold at intervals riding forward

I was enjoined to act again
Since I had to hold the entire company

I was enjoined to act again myself
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

I was enjoying acting against myself
and hold and wish to hold

I let it remind me again
designed to hold up my underwear
