('again', 'into')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
into rotating directionless 

at any time it can drift again
into a brigand and a murderer

I keep turning back again myself
into the well controlled climate

I was enjoined to act again myself
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I let it remind me again
Then I saw into you
