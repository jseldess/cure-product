Then blue and sun again a second, then night
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

at any time it can drift again
The sun isn’t up

I keep turning back again myself
Then the sun isn’t up

a similar desire against me
Then the sun isn’t available

I was enjoined to act again
but the sun isn’t up

blue and sun again a second, then night
