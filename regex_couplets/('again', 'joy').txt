('again', 'joy')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

at any time it can drift again
I was enjoying acting against myself

I was enjoined to act again myself
a futile joyous white sun

I let it remind me again
some sort of a futile joyous white sun
