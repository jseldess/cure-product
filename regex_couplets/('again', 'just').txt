('again', 'just')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

at any time it can drift again
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I keep turning back again myself
I just got a letter

blue and sun again a second, then night
it was not just a defeat

I let it remind me again
was not just a defeat
