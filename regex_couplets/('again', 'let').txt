('again', 'let')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
But I can’t let myself treat 

at any time it can drift again
I let myself treat

I was enjoined to act again myself
If I let myself see others desires

I keep turning back again myself
It’s the third letter from the end

blue and sun again a second, then night
I let it remind me again
