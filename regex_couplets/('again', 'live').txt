('again', 'live')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Which is a measure to never live out

at any time it can drift again
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I keep turning back again myself
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I let it remind me again
where I send and relive aside
