('again', 'longer')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I argued the days felt longer

I was enjoined to act again myself
I argued the days were longer

I was enjoying acting against myself
I agrued the days were longer

I am bid to act again
I argued that the days were longer

I am enjoined to act again
without longer damage
