('again', 'me')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Then I constellate my time family country

at any time it can drift again
where I sleep at times

I was enjoined to act again myself
Then I canâ€™t presume to need others

I keep turning back again myself
Then fall then summer

a similar desire against me
an unassimilable desire against me

I was enjoined to act again
emerging this year from standing water

blue and sun again a second, then night
I had me a vision

I am bid to act again
since I can imagine movement

I am enjoined to act again
with full potential to movement

I was enjoying acting against myself
since you can imagine movement

I let it remind me again
And for an ungraspable time
