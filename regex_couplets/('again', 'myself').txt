('again', 'myself')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

at any time it can drift again
I let myself treat

I was enjoined to act again myself
If I let myself see others desires

I keep turning back again myself
I’ll pull myself higher up

blue and sun again a second, then night
off the end myself

I was enjoying acting against myself
I was bid to act again myself

I was big to act again
myself
