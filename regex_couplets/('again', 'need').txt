('again', 'need')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

at any time it can drift again
drifting away needs

I was enjoined to act again myself
Then I can’t presume to need others

I keep turning back again myself
I need the work

I let it remind me again
where I need gravity
