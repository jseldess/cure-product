('again', 'no')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type

at any time it can drift again
But not to impart cynicism

I was enjoined to act again myself
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I keep turning back again myself
In a vertiginous dream

a similar desire against me
not back in the results

I was enjoined to act again
Then I cannot see face value

blue and sun again a second, then night
upsent in the afternoon

I am bid to act again
that their economic value 

I was enjoying acting against myself
there was no promotion

I am enjoined to act again
I take it out in the snow fall

I let it remind me again
I used my technology
