('again', 'now')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
On a snow day with my children

at any time it can drift again
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

I was enjoined to act again myself
out in the snow

I keep turning back again myself
out in the snow fall

I am bid to act again
I take it out in the snow fall

I let it remind me again
knowing the constituents
