('again', 'only')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
only fragments of time with my children

at any time it can drift again
only in the case

I keep turning back again myself
So that I notice I am the only one

blue and sun again a second, then night
I see only the back

I was enjoined to act again myself
would only willingly break
