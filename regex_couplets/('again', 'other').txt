('again', 'other')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

at any time it can drift again
others desires

I was enjoined to act again myself
Then I can’t presume to need others

I keep turning back again myself
On the other hand

I let it remind me again
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
