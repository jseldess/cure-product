('again', 'over')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I step over the edge

at any time it can drift again
over the long time up in the sky

I was enjoined to act again myself
over the time line I was on

I keep turning back again myself
hovering above standing water

blue and sun again a second, then night
oddly grown over with historic bark

I am bid to act again
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

I let it remind me again
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
