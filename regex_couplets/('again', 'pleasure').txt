('again', 'pleasure')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

at any time it can drift again
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I keep turning back again myself
there was no walking along the pleasure

I let it remind me again
