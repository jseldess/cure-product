('again', 'potential')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

at any time it can drift again
I am full of potential

I am enjoined to act again
with full potential to movement

I was enjoying acting against myself
full of potential

I let it remind me again
