('again', 'pull')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

at any time it can drift again
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

I was enjoined to act again myself
I’ll pull my data higher up

I keep turning back again myself
fish pulled out of the lake

a similar desire against me
I’ll pull myself higher up

blue and sun again a second, then night
