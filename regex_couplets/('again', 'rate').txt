('again', 'rate')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

at any time it can drift again
and my heart rate

I keep turning back again myself
and my heartrate

a similar desire against me
Strategy comes before morning

blue and sun again a second, then night
and strategies not tactics

I was enjoined to act again myself
I aspirate with little vision

I let it remind me again
