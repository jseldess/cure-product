('again', 'set')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
upset by Gingrich

I keep turning back again myself
in front of the set afternoon

I was enjoined to act again myself
in front of the set of regulations

I am bid to act again
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
