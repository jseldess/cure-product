('again', 'sleep.')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
where I sleep at times

at any time it can drift again
Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times

I keep turning back again myself
While I should be sleeping

a similar desire against me
While I should sleep not back in the results

I was enjoined to act again
like flattening sleep 

I let it remind me again
