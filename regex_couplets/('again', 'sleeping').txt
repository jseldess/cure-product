('again', 'sleeping')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

at any time it can drift again
While I should be sleeping

I keep turning back again myself
Looking back while I should be sleeping

a similar desire against me
