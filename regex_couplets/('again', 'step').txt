('again', 'step')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I step off the edge

at any time it can drift again
What the next step

blue and sun again a second, then night
Whatâ€™s the next step

I was enjoined to act again myself
from which to step off

I let it remind me again
step in by the prospect
