('again', 'tell')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Then I constellate my time family country

at any time it can drift again
So I constellate the time family country

I keep turning back again myself
The CEO tells me to embody values

a similar desire against me
I had to tell them the news

I let it remind me again
I tell you my purposes
