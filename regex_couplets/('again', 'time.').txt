('again', 'time.')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Then I constellate my time family country

at any time it can drift again
where I sleep at times

I was enjoined to act again myself
Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times

I keep turning back again myself
I spend time online learning to code

a similar desire against me
On the timeline I was on

blue and sun again a second, then night
The long time I had a vision

I let it remind me again
or alter of course the time anyway
