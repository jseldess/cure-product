('again', 'too')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

at any time it can drift again
emerging this year from too much standing water

I was enjoined to act again myself
learned without too much difficulty to code

blue and sun again a second, then night
Selma knows too
