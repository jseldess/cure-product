('again', 'up?')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

at any time it can drift again
as a pure product

I was enjoined to act again myself
The South Carolina primary 

I keep turning back again myself
Then the sun isn’t up

a similar desire against me
an unassimilable desire against me

I was enjoined to act again
before the sun’s deflections

blue and sun again a second, then night
upsent in the afternoon

I am bid to act again
I argued the days were longer

I was enjoying acting against myself
I hear it between bills and stuff

I am enjoined to act again
And as an extension of the values

I was bid to act again myself
or argued for them at least

I was big to act again
with full potential to movement

I let it remind me again
while consuming damage
