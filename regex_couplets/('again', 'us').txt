('again', 'us')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
asynchronous 

at any time it can drift again
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I keep turning back again myself
In a vertiginous dream

a similar desire against me
Remnant continuous pages

I was enjoined to act again
The ventillation rushes on

blue and sun again a second, then night
So stay with us

I let it remind me again
I used my technology
