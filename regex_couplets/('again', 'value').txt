('again', 'value')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
value falling off the edge of the face

at any time it can drift again
Then I cannot see face value

I was enjoined to act again myself
The value falling off the edge of the face

I keep turning back again myself
The CEO tells me to embody values

a similar desire against me
And as an extension of the values

blue and sun again a second, then night
of my economic value

I am bid to act again
that their economic value 

I was enjoying acting against myself
As an extension of the values

I let it remind me again
