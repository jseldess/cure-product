('again', 'values')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
And as an extension of the values

I was enjoined to act again myself
The CEO tells me to embody values

I keep turning back again myself
I see only the back of falling values

blue and sun again a second, then night
I see the back of falling values

I am bid to act again
As an extension of the values

I let it remind me again
