('again', 'visible')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I assumed it was visible

at any time it can drift again
Iâ€™ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

I was enjoined to act again myself
And make myself a visible

I keep turning back again myself
I assume the offers divisible
