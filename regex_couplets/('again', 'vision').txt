('again', 'vision')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I had me a vision

I was enjoined to act again myself
The planning process for visions

blue and sun again a second, then night
The planning process is for visionaries only

I am bid to act again
aspirating visions

I am enjoined to act again
aspirating with visions

I was bid to act again myself
embodied with little visions

I was big to act again
little visions

I let it remind me again
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
