('again', 'visions')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
The planning process for visions

blue and sun again a second, then night
aspirating visions

I am bid to act again
aspirating with visions

I am enjoined to act again
embodied with little visions

I was enjoined to act again myself
little visions

I let it remind me again
visions that can be attainable
