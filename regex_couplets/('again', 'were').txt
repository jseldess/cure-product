('again', 'were')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
When we had jobs that were to earn

I keep turning back again myself
my desires were open

a similar desire against me
I argued the days were longer

I was enjoying acting against myself
I agrued the days were longer

I am bid to act again
The days were long

I am enjoined to act again
I argued that the days were longer

I let it remind me again
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
