('again', 'When')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
When I woke up in the morning

at any time it can drift again
When we had jobs that were to earn

I keep turning back again myself
When they really take hold of my finger

a similar desire against me
When closed to my knowing

I let it remind me again
When I'm watching my tv
