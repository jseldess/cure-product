('again', 'world')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
off the edge of the world

at any time it can drift again
Which can be pronounced to the world

I keep turning back again myself
off the end of the world

I am bid to act again
hauling off the end of the world

I let it remind me again
the opinions in my world
