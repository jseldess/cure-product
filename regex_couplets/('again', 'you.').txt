('again', 'you.')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Though how can you know without direction

at any time it can drift again
bring your child along

I was enjoined to act again myself
You can hear it also through your leisure

I keep turning back again myself
That you can see only the back of

I am bid to act again
since you can imagine movement

I am enjoined to act again
where you can earn more 

I let it remind me again
I tell you my purposes
