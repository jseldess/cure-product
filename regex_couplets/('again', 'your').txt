('again', 'your')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
You can hear it also through your leisure

at any time it can drift again
bring your child along

I was enjoined to act again myself
May I have your zip code

I keep turning back again myself
your bid to the next highest ranked network

I am bid to act again
This is your voice
