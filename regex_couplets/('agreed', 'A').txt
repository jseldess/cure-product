('agreed', 'A')

and to which I’ve agreed
And we could inhabit the room easy

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
All parties would be held for my own purchases

and for which the plan agreed
CONTRACT

and to which the plan agreed
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

that agreed one of rest
A baby and a bear

that agreed home
All that I own messageable
