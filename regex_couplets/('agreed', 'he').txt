('agreed', 'he')

and to which I’ve agreed
all parties would be held

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
where I send and relive would be held

and for which the plan agreed
when it is not literal

that agreed one of rest
speak them of my possessions

and to which the plan agreed
when I move

that agreed home
I can’t remember them

that agreed to one the people
the people in home form

that agreed one best
the people in own form

that agreed home to people
the people in form own
