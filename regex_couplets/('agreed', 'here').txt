('agreed', 'here')

and to which I’ve agreed
if there is anything 

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
where I send and relive would be held

and for which the plan agreed
Where in me did I host

that agreed one of rest
Elsewhere by my memory

and to which the plan agreed
there wasn’t any television 

that agreed home
The prospects there already

that agreed to one the people
The offers there already
