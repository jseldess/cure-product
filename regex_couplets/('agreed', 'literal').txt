('agreed', 'literal')

and to which I’ve agreed
and literally moved

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
and literally unproved

and for which the plan agreed
when it is not literal

that agreed one of rest
and literally moved about

and to which the plan agreed
I literally moved

that agreed home
