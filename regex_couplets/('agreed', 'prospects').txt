('agreed', 'prospects')

and to which I’ve agreed
the impulse for my own prospects

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
the impulse my own prospects

and for which the plan agreed
speech that is of by prospects

that agreed one of rest
The prospects there already

that agreed to one the people
the prospects being seen by me
