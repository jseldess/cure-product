('agreed', 'pulse')

and to which I’ve agreed
I send and retrieve the impulse

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

and for which the plan agreed
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

that agreed one of rest
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

that agreed home
