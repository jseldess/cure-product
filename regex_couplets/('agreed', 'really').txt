('agreed', 'really')

and to which I’ve agreed
without really agreeing

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
without really speaking

and for which the plan agreed
without really binding

that agreed one of rest
without really needing

and to which the plan agreed
also didn’t really move

that agreed home
