('agreed', 'side')

and to which I’ve agreed
But my not feeling the memory aside

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

and for which the plan agreed
by the side of the hosting service

that agreed one of rest
But my not feeling the memory inside

that agreed home
