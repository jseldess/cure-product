('agreed', 'so')

and to which I’ve agreed
I want to cite a poem so usual

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
sound inundated for my own purchases

and for which the plan agreed
so still watch them

that agreed one of rest
by in the sound privacy

that agreed home
and could be inflected with reasons

that agreed to one the people
buy in the sound privacy
