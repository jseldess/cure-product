('agreed', 'speak')

and to which I’ve agreed
not speaking

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
without really speaking

and for which the plan agreed
I speak to them my possessions

that agreed one of rest
speak them of my possessions

and to which the plan agreed
I speak them of my possessions

that agreed home
