('agreed', 'up?')

and to which I’ve agreed
all parties would be held

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
where I send and relive would be held

and for which the plan agreed
in the form filled offered in trust

that agreed one of rest
own stays brought loyal

and to which the plan agreed
it can be uncomfortable 

that agreed home
decisions that can be attributable

that agreed to one the people
own best form to ourselves

that agreed one best
home stays brought loyal

that agreed home to people
home rest form to ourselves
