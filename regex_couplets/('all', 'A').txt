('all', 'A')

I’ll get there eventually
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
PREFACE

it was really sunny
All of the time

Then fall then summer
Actually one day there is direction

Falling from this distance
And as an extension of the values

Falling from my face
And make myself a visible

eventually 
After having been contented

though it was most emphatically that
BREAK

When they really take hold of my finger
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

I see only the back of falling values
ASPIRATING

I see the back of falling values
Aspirational strategy

I can see only the back of falling values
ASPIRATING VISIONS

They are called aspirational
As an extension of the values

falling off the encoded end
All that I can think I want

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
A defeated

Toward the start informally given my reasons
COPY DREAM 

As a clone, illegally conceived
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Articles all around us
And we had to say goodbye to her there

articles all around storming around
Articles all around stores in surfeit

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
And from a weak distance

all the spots
And from a great distance

we had inhabited actually
And we could inhabit the room easy

all parties would be held

all parties would be helped
All parties would be held for my own purchases

and literally unproved
CONTRACT

and literally moved
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

It’s not marshall exactly
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

formally a way to the elections
Aligned or not with my interests

not literally moved about
3 [PASSWORDS]

in that all this in private is messageable
All that I own messageable

but I own all that’s messageable
