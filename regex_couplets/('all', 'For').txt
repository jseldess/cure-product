('all', 'For')

I’ll get there eventually
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Falling from this distance
Forecasting the story before dawn

eventually
For an ungraspable time

articles all around us
For an ungraspable purchase

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
For Mitt Romney

though it was most emphatically that
For my own purchases

all parties would be held
Formerly a way like this one

It’s not marshall exactly
Formerly away there are constant ways

The many transparent pixel calls
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

formally a way to the elections
For a while I think I don’t listen

but I own all that’s messageable
