('all', 'It')

I’ll get there eventually
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

because it was really dark
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
It keeps coming down thankfully

Then fall then summer
It has been since

Falling from this distance
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

I see only the back of falling values
It’s not marshal exactly

It’s not marshall exactly
