('all', 'Or')

I’ll get there eventually
Or the company

Then fall then summer
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
Or alter of course the time anyway

all parties would be held
Or can have seen offering possession

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
