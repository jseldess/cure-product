('all', 'so')

I’ll get there eventually
reasons resources

because it was really dark
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
When I want something

Then fall then summer
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

especially in a child
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling from this distance
soft paper

Falling from my face
I’ll pull myself another personality type

and not falling at all
solvents

though it was most emphatically that
with reasons

If you have confidence regardless all else
A person from a distance

When they really take hold of my finger
or an available resource

eventually
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

I see only the back of falling values
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

with internally regulated climate
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

falling off the encoded end
If I take some different measure

I take it out in the snow fall
no solid ground to continue along

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

all that I can think I want
I cannot clear it also through investiture

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
Toward the start informally given my reasons

Which can be called confidence
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

all the spots
so that nothing had gravity

As a clone, illegally conceived
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

we had inhabited actually
I want to cite a poem so usual

all parties would be helped
sound inundated for my own purchases

all parties would be held
and sound redundant

and literally unproved
firing and connecting somewhere

without really branding 
so still watch them

not literally moved about
so still them

It’s not marshall exactly
by in the sound privacy

to take the call
also didn’t really move

formally a way to the elections
buy in the sound privacy

in that all this in private is messageable
and could be inflected with reasons

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
