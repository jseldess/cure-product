('all', 'THE')

I’ll get there eventually
THE SNOW

Falling from this distance
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

Then fall then summer
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

I see only the back of falling values
THE OFFERS

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

As a clone, illegally conceived
