('all', 'That')

I’ll get there eventually
That’s exaclty what I want for them

especially in a child
That is itself not still

Then fall then summer
That’s where I sleep at times

Falling from this distance
That’s when they really take

When they really take hold of my finger
That you can see only the back of

with internally regulated climate
That company creates a life

falling off the encoded end
That I captured an afterimage

As a clone, illegally conceived
That are my right to say

not literally moved
