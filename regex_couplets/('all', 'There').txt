('all', 'There')

I’ll get there eventually
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Then fall then summer
There are quarterly goals

Falling from this distance
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

though it was most emphatically that
There was very little physical activity

falling off the encoded end
There are spots waiting

As a clone, illegally conceived
There are constant ways

The many transparent pixel calls
There are no constant waves

formally a way to the elections
