('all', 'They')

I’ll get there eventually
They’re just not mine

Actually one day there is direction
They are called aspirational

with internally regulated climate
They can be waived

As a clone, illegally conceived
They have very many choices

all parties would be helped
They were filters

formally a way to the elections
