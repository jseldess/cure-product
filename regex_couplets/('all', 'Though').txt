('all', 'though')

I’ll get there eventually
As though stationary and a destination

Then fall then summer
though it was most emphatically that

If you have confidence regardless all else
I had nightmares though

falling off the encoded end
though not many freeze up

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I thought

We had inhabited actually
though we are still breaking in

all parties would be helped
though we are breaking in the space that it had

as it was designed literally
after though there’s no memory

It’s not marshall exactly
I answered what I thought

formally a way to the elections
I answered what I thought about

not literally moved
