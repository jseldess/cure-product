('all', 'To')

I’ll get there eventually
To my children Walt Whitman

Then fall then summer
To my chidren

Falling from this distance
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

though it was most emphatically that
To neither study

When they really take hold of my finger
To that impossible place

Eventually
Tomorrow

I see only the back of falling values
Toward the start informally given my reasons

If you have confidence regardless all else
To substitute neither study

Which can be called confidence
To the ends of transactions

It’s not marshall exactly
To the ends of my transactions

The many transparent pixel calls
To the other end of transactions

formally a way to the elections
To the right of determined elections

not literally moved
