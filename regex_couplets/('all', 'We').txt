('all', 'We')

I’ll get there eventually
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

because it was really dark
We can wrestle them with their goals

Then fall then summer
We had to say goodbye there

articles all around storming around
We had to buy there

Articles all around us
We had inhabited actually

all parties would be held
We got paid one way by a voice

If you have confidence regardless all else
We ask say in that case

in that all this in private is messageable
