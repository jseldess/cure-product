('all', 'You')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling from this distance
You use the most essential parts

When they really take hold of my finger
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
You need history

which is all the time
You can have seen offering
