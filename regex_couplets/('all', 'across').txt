('all', 'across')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
Before we walk across the wide field

because it was really dark
Before we walk across the wide opening

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Then fall then summer
Before anyone walks across the opening

especially in a child
across the retinas

falling off the encoded end
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

though it was most emphatically that
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

stopping off in all directions
