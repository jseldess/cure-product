('all', 'act')

I’ll get there eventually
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Then fall then summer from my face
In the retroactive light

Falling from this distance
of retroactive observations

Then fall then summer
In the light of retroactive conversations

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
One day was actually

Actually one day there is direction
I was enjoined to act again myself

Falling from my face
I was enjoined to act again

Eventually
and strategies not tactics

I see the back of falling values
Not goals or tactics

They are called aspirational
I am bid to act again

falling off the encoded end
actually considering the end

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I refuse indelible tracts

all that I can think I want
I refuse indelible contracts

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
we had inhabited actually

all parties would be held
to the ends of my transactions

and literally moved
The ends of my transactions

to take the call
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

literally moved
To the ends of transactions

It’s not marshall exactly
of my actions

The many transparent pixel calls
The other ends of my transactions

formally a way to the elections
I turn not sad exactly

not literally moved about
I return not sad exactly

not literally moved
I returned not sad exactly

in that all this in private is messageable
before I act on them

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
