('all', 'agreed')

I’ll get there eventually
and to which I’ve agreed

all parties would be held
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

and literally unproved
and for which the plan agreed

without really binding
that agreed one of rest

and literally moved
and to which the plan agreed

I literally moved
that agreed home

in that all this in private is messageable
