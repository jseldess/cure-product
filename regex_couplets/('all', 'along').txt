('all', 'along')

I’ll get there eventually
bring your child along

Falling from this distance
The days lined along company

falling off the encoded end
there was no walking along the pleasure

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
formerly along time they were on

It’s not marshall exactly
formerly along my say to the elections

formally a way to the elections
along cables

recalling aside
shone formerly along time

not literally moved
