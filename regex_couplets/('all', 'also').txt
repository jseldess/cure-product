('all', 'also')

I’ll get there eventually
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling from this distance
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

all that I can think I want
I cannot clear it also through investiture

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
also didn’t really move

not literally moved about
