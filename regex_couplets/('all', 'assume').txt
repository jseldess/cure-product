('all', 'assume')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
I assumed it was visible

because it was really dark
I assumed 

and literally moved
I assumed what I draw

formally a way to the elections
I assume the offers reliable

in that all this in private is messageable
I assume the offers revisitable

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
I assumed that they were divisible

stopping off in all directions
I assume possession to others
