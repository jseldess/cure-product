('all', 'away')

I’ll get there eventually
drifting away

because it was really dark
drifting away needs others presume desires

Falling from this distance
drifting away needs

Falling from my face
Who throws contours away

It’s not marshall exactly
Formerly away there are constant ways

The many transparent pixel calls
formerly away

formally a way to the elections
