('all', 'been')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
It has been since

Falling from this distance
After having been contented

Then fall then summer
that having been after content

I see only the back of falling values
having been graspable

As a clone, illegally conceived
having been an ungraspable time

Articles all around us
Having been purchased out of you

articles all around storming around
