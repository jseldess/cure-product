('all', 'Before')

I’ll get there eventually
Before we walk across the wide field

because it was really dark
Before we walk across the wide opening

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Then fall then summer
Before anyone buys up the opening

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

especially in a child
Before morning goals

I see only the back of falling values
