('all', 'but')

I’ll get there eventually
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

because it was really dark
but not impart cynicism

Then fall then summer
I want but not to impart cynicism

Falling from this distance
Attributable or

When they really take hold of my finger
but the sun isn’t up

I see only the back of falling values
but it continued

falling off the encoded end
but would I love her the same

I take it out in the snow fall
but they are black spots

all that I can think I want
but I can hear them

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
but where is it

If you have confidence regardless all else
I resume attributable visions

which is all the time
attributable visions

As a clone, illegally conceived
that decisions can be attributable

It’s not marshall exactly
but for memory elsewhere

formally a way to the elections
decisions that can be attributable

in that all this in private is messageable
but I own all that’s messageable

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
