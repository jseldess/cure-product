('all', 'came')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
I invited most of what came next

falling off the encoded end
I came back to me

As a clone, illegally conceived
I came after my past

Articles all around us
until the bill came

we had inhabited actually
and came home to rewind inflections

in that all this in private is messageable
and came home to rewind

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
