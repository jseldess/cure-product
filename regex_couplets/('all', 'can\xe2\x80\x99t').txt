I’ll get there eventually
I can’t fix them without direction

Then fall then summer
and can’t presume to need

Falling from this distance
Then I can’t presume to need others

Falling from my face
That can’t be glimpsed

with internally regulated climate
Though we can’t help waiting

It’s not marshall exactly
I can’t remember them

in that all this in private is messageable
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
