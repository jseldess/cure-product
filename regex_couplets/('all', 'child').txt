('all', 'child')

I’ll get there eventually
On a snow day with my children

because it was really dark
a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i

it was really sunny
my children’s consumption

not calling or echoing for once
about my children’s consumption

even my child

articles all around us
Even the children

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
my possession of my children

all parties would be held
speech my possession of my children

It’s not marshall exactly
