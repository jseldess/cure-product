('all', 'children')

I’ll get there eventually
On a snow day with my children

because it was really dark
my children’s consumption

not calling or echoing for once
about my children’s consumption

Then fall then summer
only fragments of time with my children

especially in a child
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Falling from this distance
Even the children

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
my possession of my children

all parties would be held
speech my possession of my children

It’s not marshall exactly
