('all', 'code')

I’ll get there eventually
as long as I have access to the code

especially in a child
May I have your zip code

Then fall then summer
I spend time online learning to code

When they really take hold of my finger
learned without too much difficulty to code

I see only the back of falling values
falling off the encoded end

I take it out in the snow fall
encoded off the end

The first falling syllable
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

As a clone, illegally conceived
zipcode

It’s not marshall exactly
