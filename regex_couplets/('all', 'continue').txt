('all', 'continue')

I’ll get there eventually
but it continued

falling off the encoded end
no solid ground to continue along

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I continue to presume

As a clone, illegally conceived
I continue to consume

Articles all around us
Then I continue to dream then

all the spots
I continued to dream then

we had inhabited actually
