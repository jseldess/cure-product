('all', 'could')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
and could be mapped and weighed

Then fall then summer
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

When they really take hold of my finger
until I could not tire 

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
until I could not be tired

which is all the time
I could in effect credit

As a clone, illegally conceived
I could consume the dream

Articles all around us
and we could inhabit the room easy

We had inhabited actually
and could be inflected with reasons

in that all this in private is messageable
