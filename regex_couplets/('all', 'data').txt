('all', 'data')

I’ll get there eventually
I’ll pull my data higher up

eventually 
I’ll pull my data

Falling from this distance
The days of private data

falling off the encoded end
trackers collecting data on users

all parties would be helped
my interfaced stand data

not literally moved about
my standing in data

formally a way to the elections
