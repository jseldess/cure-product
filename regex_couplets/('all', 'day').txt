('all', 'day')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
On a snow day with my children

because it was really dark
One day there is direction

Then fall then summer
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

especially in a child
On a day there will be direction

One day was actually
Actually one day there is direction

Falling from this distance
I argued the days felt longer

I see the back of falling values
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

with internally regulated climate
The days long aligned

falling off the encoded end
The day

we had inhabited actually
between that day

all parties would be held
I have a memory between the day

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
at least most days

recalling aside
