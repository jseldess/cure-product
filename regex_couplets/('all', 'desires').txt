('all', 'desires')

I’ll get there eventually
others desires

Then fall then summer
If I let myself see others desires

Falling from this distance
drifting away needs others presume desires

Falling from my face
my desires were open

When they really take hold of my finger
I wish my desires were open

That’s when they really take
