('all', 'directly')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
if not directly on my skin

Then fall then summer
of not directly from my skin

especially in a child
But not to me directly

When they really take hold of my finger
The sun high enough to enter directly 

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
The sun high enough to strike directly

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
