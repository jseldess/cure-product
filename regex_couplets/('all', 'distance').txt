('all', 'distance')

I’ll get there eventually
Falling from this distance

Falling from my face
A person from a distance

Then fall then summer
And from a weak distance

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
And from that great distance

all the spots
And from a great distance

As a clone, illegally conceived
