('all', 'do')

I’ll get there eventually
in a sharp downward turn 

because it was really dark
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
In a sharp downard turn

Then fall then summer from my face
It keeps coming down thankfully

Then fall then summer
does not feel an exception

Falling from this distance
to the down arrow

Falling from my face
The dogs and lillies

and not falling at all
I brought my head down

When they really take hold of my finger
which I brought down with qualities

That’s when they really take
I brought my qualities down

Eventually
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

I see only the back of falling values
What I do in my liesure

I take it out in the snow fall
Undoubtedly 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I walk up and don’t work anymore

though it was most emphatically that
So I work and don’t look any

If you have confidence regardless all else
here is the site of the battle of maldon

Articles all around us
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

all the spots
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

As a clone, illegally conceived
and it doesn’t take long

all parties would be held
latency which doesn’t mean anything

without really branding 
I only think I don’t listen

in that all this in private is messageable
For a while I think I don’t listen

but I own all that’s messageable
