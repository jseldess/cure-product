I’ll get there eventually
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

I see only the back of falling values
I walk up and don’t work anymore

though it was most emphatically that
So I work and don’t look any

If you have confidence regardless all else
I only think I don’t listen

in that all this in private is messageable
For a while I think I don’t listen

but I own all that’s messageable
