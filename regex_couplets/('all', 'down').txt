('all', 'down')

I’ll get there eventually
in a sharp downward turn 

because it was really dark
In a sharp downard turn

Then fall then summer from my face
It keeps coming down thankfully

Then fall then summer
to the down arrow

Falling from this distance
I brought my head down

When they really take hold of my finger
which I brought down with qualities

That’s when they really take
I brought my qualities down

Eventually
I click my zipcode up where it should be down
