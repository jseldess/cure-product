('all', 'ending')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Then fall then summer from my face
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I see the back of falling values
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I take it out in the snow fall
talking into percents bending themselves

which is all the time
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

all parties would be held
battery dawn nights ending themselves

formally a way to the elections
