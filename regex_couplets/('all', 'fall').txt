('all', 'fall')

I’ll get there eventually
Then fall then summer from my face

not calling or echoing for once
and not falling at all

Falling from this distance
Face falling off the edge of the face

value falling off the edge of the face
Then fall then summer

Falling from my face
The value falling off the edge of the face

eventually 
The value falling off the edge of th face

I see only the back of falling values
I see the back of falling values

I can see only values falling back
I can see only the back of falling values

out in the snow fall
out in the snow falling face value

I am not allowed to see their face
falling off the encoded end

I take it out in the snow fall
falling off the end

The first falling syllable
falling off the end of the world

falling off the end of the word
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

all that I can think I want
