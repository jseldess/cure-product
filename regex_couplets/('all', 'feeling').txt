('all', 'feeling')

I’ll get there eventually
conversations with our feelings

Then fall then summer
conversation with our feelings

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
But my not feeling the memory aside

all parties would be helped
But my not feeling the memory inside

to take the call
By my feeling the memory inside

formally a way to the elections
But my feeling the memory aside

recalling aside
