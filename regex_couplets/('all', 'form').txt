('all', 'form')

I’ll get there eventually
There are performance reviews

Falling from this distance
Toward the start informally given my reasons

If you have confidence regardless all else
already formerly a long time

We had inhabited actually
in the form filled offered in trust

all parties would be held
dawn already formerly nights 

and literally moved
A way formerly like this one

all parties would be helped
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

and literally unproved
already formely a long time

without really speaking
dawn formerly

without really branding 
with dawn already formerly nights 

without really agreeing
in the form filled offered trust

not literally moved about
in the form filled offered must

It’s not marshall exactly
formerly a way like this one

The many transparent pixel calls
formerly a way

formally a way to the elections
formerly along time they were on

to take the call
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

recalling aside
which I feel formerly about for

not literally moved
own best form

in that all this in private is messageable
