('all', 'front')

I’ll get there eventually
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Then fall then summer
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

When they really take hold of my finger
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

I see only the back of falling values
in front of the set afternoon

I see the back of falling values
in front of the set of regulations

with internally regulated climate
And need out in front purchase

Articles all around us
And read out in front

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
behind or out front or up above

in that all this in private is messageable
