('all', 'goals')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
Though there are quarters goals

Actually one day there is direction
We can wrestle them with their goals

Then fall then summer
and without quartely goals

Falling from this distance
There are quarterly goals

Falling from my face
before morning goals

I see only the back of falling values
not goals

I see the back of falling values
Not goals or tactics

They are called aspirational
