('all', 'going')

I’ll get there eventually
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

because it was really dark
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I take it out in the snow fall
The way that she is going

all parties would be helped
The way that I am going

It’s not marshall exactly
the way that I was going

The many transparent pixel calls
way I was going 

formally a way to the elections
