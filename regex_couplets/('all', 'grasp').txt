('all', 'grasp')

I’ll get there eventually
having been graspable

As a clone, illegally conceived
having been an ungraspable time

Articles all around us
for an ungraspable purchase

articles all around storming around
under the grasp principle

Articles all around stores in surfeit
For an ungraspable time

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
And for an ungraspable time

all the spots
