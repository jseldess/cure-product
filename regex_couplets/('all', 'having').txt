('all', 'Having')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I see only the back of falling values
Having been purchased out of you

articles all around us
Having seen more than 

all parties would be held
Having seen more than I can remember 

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
