('all', 'head')

I’ll get there eventually
Without a head

Falling from this distance
I brought my head down

Then fall then summer
I search with my head

That’s when they really take
with my head

When they really take hold of my finger
I log in and search with my head

Eventually
into the next level head

They are called aspirational
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

literally moved
