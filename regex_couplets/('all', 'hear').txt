('all', 'hear')

I’ll get there eventually
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling from this distance
and my heart rate

Then fall then summer
and my heartrate

When they really take hold of my finger
I hear it between bills and stuff

Eventually
I can hear it between bills and stuff

falling off the encoded end
that I can hear

The first falling syllable
as far back as my history heard

all that I can think I want
that I hear without trying

falling off the end
I can hear them between bills and stuff

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
In my heart did I lose trust

It’s not marshall exactly
