('all', 'high')

I’ll get there eventually
way high up in the inter

Falling off the edge of the face
I’ll pull my data higher up

eventually 
high up in the internet

Falling from this distance
way high up in the internet

Face falling off the edge of the face
higher up in the results

results eventually
high in the content architecture

I’ll pull myself higher up

Falling from my face
your bid to the next highest ranked network

They are called aspirational
The sun high enough to enter directly 

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
The sun high enough to strike directly

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
