('all', 'hold')

I’ll get there eventually
I take hold of my finger

Then fall then summer
When they really take hold of my finger

That’s when they really take
hold at intervals riding forward

Eventually
Since I had to hold the entire company

falling off the encoded end
and hold and wish to hold

As a clone, illegally conceived
designed to hold up my underwear

all the spots
