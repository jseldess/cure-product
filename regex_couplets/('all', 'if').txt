('all', 'if')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
drifting away

because it was really dark
if not directly on my skin

Then fall then summer
drifting does not feel an exception

Falling from this distance
drifting away needs

Falling from my face
if you have providence to excess

though it was most emphatically that
if he had not carried one virtue 

When they really take hold of my finger
out of the fifth page ruins

Eventually
learned without too much difficulty to code

I see only the back of falling values
That company creates a life

falling off the encoded end
If I take a different measure

I take it out in the snow fall
If I take some different measure

falling off the end
if there is anything 

We had inhabited actually
if you have providence

all parties would be helped
if that has anything

without really needing
if only on the way to the trash

in that all this in private is messageable
