('all', 'know')

I’ll get there eventually
who knows the way

Then fall then summer from my face
how can I know without direction

Then fall then summer
I even know what I would find

falling off the end of the world
even when close to my knowing

As a clone, illegally conceived
knowing the constituents

without really branding 
who knows how to turn it off

It’s not marshall exactly
who know the ways to their other end

The many transparent pixel calls
who know the way to their other end

The many transparent pixels call
that their knowing

in that all this in private is messageable
