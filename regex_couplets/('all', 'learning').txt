('all', 'learning')

I’ll get there eventually
in light of learning what we see

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
I spend time online learning to code

Then fall then summer
Then I am learning to code

I see only the back of falling values
phase decision for learning

It’s not marshall exactly
for learning by the prospect

not literally moved about
a precision for learning

in that all this in private is messageable
