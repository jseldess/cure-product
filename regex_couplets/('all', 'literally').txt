('all', 'literally')

I’ll get there eventually
and literally moved

without really agreeing
as it was designed literally

all parties would be held
and literally unproved

without really speaking
literally unproved 

to take the call
myself moved literally as it is

and literally moved about
I literally moved

and move them literally with me
I literally move them

literally move
literally moved

what literally moved
not literally moved about

It’s not marshall exactly
not literally moved

in that all this in private is messageable
