('all', 'live')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
Which is a measure to never live out

Falling from this distance
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Then fall then summer
Which is a pleasure to never live out

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
where I send and relive aside

all parties would be helped
where I send and relive would be held

all parties would be held
where I stand and relive

and literally unproved
where I send and relive

to take the call
where I send and retrieve relive

without really branding 
where I stand and retrieve relive

recalling aside
