('all', 'many')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
not many face up

all that I can think I want
though not many freeze up

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
They have very many choices

all parties would be helped
The many transparent pixel calls

The many transparent pixels call
of the many transparent pixel calls

calls
