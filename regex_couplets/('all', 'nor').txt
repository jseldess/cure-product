('all', 'nor')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
into the minority proportion of time

because it was really dark
over the long line I would honor

Then fall then summer
nor work in this way daily

When they really take hold of my finger
the simple act of honoring an accountant

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
nor envy honest work

though it was most emphatically that
nor envy honestly

If you have confidence regardless all else
which had on honor to be told

without really branding 
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

formally a way to the elections
