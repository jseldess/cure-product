('all', 'only')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
only fragments of time with my children

Then fall then summer
only in the case

When they really take hold of my finger
So that I notice I am the only one

I see only the back of falling values
I see only the back

I see the back of falling values
I can see only values falling back

I can see only the back of falling values
then I can see only the back of values

out in the snow fall
The planning process is for visionaries only

out in the snow falling face value
then I can see only the back values

with internally regulated climate
would only willingly break

all parties would be held
would speak willingly only

without really branding 
if only on the way to the trash

in that all this in private is messageable
less only money

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
