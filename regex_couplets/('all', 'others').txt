('all', 'others')

I’ll get there eventually
others desires

Then fall then summer
Then I can’t presume to need others

Falling from this distance
If I let myself see others desires

Falling from my face
I presume to others

all parties would be held
Cereal and others’ health

not literally moved
I assume possession to others
