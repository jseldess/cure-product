('all', 'pleasure')

I’ll get there eventually
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Which is a pleasure to never live out

Then fall then summer
there was no walking along the pleasure

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
up in the television pleasure

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
