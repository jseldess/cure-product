('all', 'possession')

I’ll get there eventually
I speak to them my possessions

and move them literally with me
my possessions

all parties would be held
my possession of my children

It’s not marshall exactly
I speak them of my possessions

not literally moved about
I stay the right of my possessions 

not literally moved
To the right of interned possessions

in that all this in private is messageable
Or can have seen offering possession

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
seen having or offering possession
