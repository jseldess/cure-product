('all', 'presume')

I’ll get there eventually
and can’t presume to need

Falling from this distance
Then I can’t presume to need others

Falling from my face
I continue to presume

As a clone, illegally conceived
I presume to others

all parties would be held
So I presume the offers already

in that all this in private is messageable
I presume the offers

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
