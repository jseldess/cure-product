('all', 'product')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
an impure product

because it was really dark
What is an impure product

it was really sunny
as a cure product

Then fall then summer
as a pure product

Falling from this distance
as an impure product

Falling from my face
the least productive of myself

recalling aside
