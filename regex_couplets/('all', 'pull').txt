('all', 'pull')

I’ll get there eventually
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Falling from this distance
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

Falling from my face
I’ll pull my data higher up

eventually 
fish pulled out of the lake

Then fall then summer
I’ll pull myself higher up

and not falling at all
