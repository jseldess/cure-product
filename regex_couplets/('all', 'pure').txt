('all', 'pure')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
an impure product

because it was really dark
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

it was really sunny
What is an impure product

Falling from this distance
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Then fall then summer
as a pure product

Falling from my face
as an impure product

and not falling at all
