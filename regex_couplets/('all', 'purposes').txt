('all', 'purposes')

I’ll get there eventually
I tell you my purposes

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I tell you the weight of my purposes

As a clone, illegally conceived
Where I host my purposes

though it was most emphatically that
I have entered my purposes

all parties would be helped
the impulse for my own purposes

without really speaking
for my own purposes

Not literally moved
