('all', 'really')

I’ll get there eventually
because it was really dark

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
it was really sunny

Then fall then summer from my face
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Then fall then summer
When they really take hold of my finger

That’s when they really take
without really agreeing

We had inhabited actually
without really speaking

as it was designed literally
without really breaking

literally unproved 
without really branding 

without really binding myself
without really binding

I literally moved
without really needing

and literally moved about
also didn’t really move

not literally moved about
