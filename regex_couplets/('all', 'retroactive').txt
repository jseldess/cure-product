('all', 'retroactive')

I’ll get there eventually
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Then fall then summer from my face
In the retroactive light

Falling from this distance
of retroactive observations

Then fall then summer
In the light of retroactive conversations

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
