('all', 'say')

I’ll get there eventually
we had to say goodbye

articles all around us
We had to say goodbye there

articles all around storming around
And we had to say goodbye to her there

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I ask say in that case

all parties would be held
we ask say in that case

It’s not marshall exactly
formerly along my say to the elections

formally a way to the elections
I ask say in that phase decisioned

not literally moved about
My say to the elections

not literally moved
