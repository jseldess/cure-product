('all', 'sleep')

I’ll get there eventually
where I sleep at times

because it was really dark
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
So I went back to sleep

Then fall then summer from my face
That’s where I sleep at times

Falling from this distance
Interrupted sleep or

Then fall then summer
While I should be sleeping

When they really take hold of my finger
Looking back while I should be sleeping

That’s when they really take
While I should sleep not back in the results

Eventually
like flattening sleep 

which is all the time
