('all', 'still')

I’ll get there eventually
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

because it was really dark
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
That is itself not still

Then fall then summer
I love my daughter still

I take it out in the snow fall
though we are still breaking in

all parties would be helped
still wash conserving

not literally moved about
so still them

It’s not marshall exactly
