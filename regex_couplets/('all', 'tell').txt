('all', 'tell')

I’ll get there eventually
Then I constellate my time family country

because it was really dark
So I constellate the time family country

Falling from this distance
I constellate the time

If you have confidence regardless all else
The CEO tells me to embody values

Then fall then summer
I had to tell them the news

falling off the encoded end
I tell you my purposes

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I tell you the weight of my purchases

As a clone, illegally conceived
and that man comes on to tell me 

literally moved
