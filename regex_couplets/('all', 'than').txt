('all', 'than')

I’ll get there eventually
It keeps coming down thankfully

Then fall then summer
than in the incoming stream

especially in a child
than solid ground

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
Having seen more than 

all parties would be held
Having seen more than I can remember 

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
