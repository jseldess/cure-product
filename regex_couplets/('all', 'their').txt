('all', 'their')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
We can wrestle them with their goals

Then fall then summer
I am not allowed to see their face

with internally regulated climate
increasingly that their economic value

They are called aspirational
that their economic value 

falling off the encoded end
without their agreement

literally move
to their other end

The many transparent pixel calls
who know the way to their other end

The many transparent pixels call
that their knowing

in that all this in private is messageable
