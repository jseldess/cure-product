('all', 'themselves')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Then fall then summer from my face
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I take it out in the snow fall
talking into percents bending themselves

which is all the time
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

all parties would be held
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

formally a way to the elections
battery dawn nights ending themselves

not literally moved
