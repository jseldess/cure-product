('all', 'think')

I’ll get there eventually
all that I can think I want

I take it out in the snow fall
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I only think I don’t listen

in that all this in private is messageable
For a while I think I don’t listen

but I own all that’s messageable
