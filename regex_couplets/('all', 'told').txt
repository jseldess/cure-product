('all', 'told')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
I told her a story, she drew waves.

because it was really dark
I am told ventillation

Falling off the edge of the face
I am told by no ventillation

Then fall then summer
I am told by the ventillation

I see only the back of falling values
which ran to be told

without really branding
