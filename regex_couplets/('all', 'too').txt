('all', 'too')

I’ll get there eventually
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

because it was really dark
too sunny to eat ice cream

Then fall then summer from my face
emerging this year from too much standing water

Then fall then summer
learned without too much difficulty to code

I see only the back of falling values
Selma knows too 

It’s not marshall exactly
