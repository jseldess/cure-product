('all', 'turn')

I’ll get there eventually
in a sharp downward turn 

because it was really dark
In a sharp downard turn

Then fall then summer from my face
sudden downward turn

Falling from this distance
I keep turning back again myself

Then fall then summer
I keep turning back

When they really take hold of my finger
who knows how to turn it off

It’s not marshall exactly
I turn not sad exactly

not literally moved about
I return not sad exactly

not literally moved
I returned not sad exactly

in that all this in private is messageable
