('all', 'until')

I’ll get there eventually
until my purpose up in the sky

Then fall then summer
until I could not tire 

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
until I could not be tired

which is all the time
until I purpose up in the sky

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
until I purchase up the sky

all the spots
until I purchase up in the sky

As a clone, illegally conceived
until a happier time found

without really branding
