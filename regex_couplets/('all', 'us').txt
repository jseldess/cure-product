('all', 'us')

I’ll get there eventually
asynchronous 

because it was really dark
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Then fall then summer
They’re just not mine

Actually one day there is direction
russling to stay still

Falling from this distance
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Falling from my face
I want to cite a poem so usual

though it was most emphatically that
was not just a defeat

When they really take hold of my finger
in a continuous vertiginous dream

That’s when they really take
In a continuous theme

Eventually
The ventillation rushes on

I see only the back of falling values
So stay with us

falling off the encoded end
I reuse unassimilable visions

I take it out in the snow fall
because there was no solid ground to continue along

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I reuse indelible tracks 

falling off the end
I refuse indelible tracts

all that I can think I want
I refuse indelible contracts

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
it was not just a defeat

Toward the start informally given my reasons
I have them trust in me

As a clone, illegally conceived
Articles all around us

articles all around storming around
I wear suspenders

all the spots
a futile joyous white sun

we had inhabited actually
in the form filled offered in trust

all parties would be held
trackers collecting data on users

all parties would be helped
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

and literally unproved
useless for not having paid

without really binding myself
uses for the attention of the brand

myself moved literally as it is
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

literally moved
about the sight hosting trusting

not literally moved about
in the form filled offered must

It’s not marshall exactly
radiating from housing

formally a way to the elections
