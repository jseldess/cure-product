('all', 'vision')

I’ll get there eventually
I had me a vision

Then fall then summer
The planning process for visions

I see the back of falling values
The planning process is for visionaries only

I can see only the back of falling values
aspirating visions

with internally regulated climate
aspirating with visions

falling off the encoded end
I reuse unassimilable visions

I take it out in the snow fall
there wasn’t any television 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I resume unassimilable visions

falling off the end
The long time I had a vision

all that I can think I want
up in the television pleasure

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
The long time I was a vision

which is all the time
I resume attributable visions

As a clone, illegally conceived
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

we had inhabited actually
joined in my television

also didn’t really move
joined me in wasting my vision

not literally moved about
visions that can be attainable

in that all this in private is messageable
revisions that can be attributable

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
