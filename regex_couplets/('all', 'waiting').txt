('all', 'waiting')

I’ll get there eventually
There are spots waiting

As a clone, illegally conceived
Though we are waiting for her

We had inhabited actually
Though we are waiting 

all parties would be held
Though we can’t help waiting

It’s not marshall exactly
waiting out front or up above 

in that all this in private is messageable
