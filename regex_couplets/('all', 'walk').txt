('all', 'walk')

I’ll get there eventually
Before we walk across the wide field

because it was really dark
Before we walk across the wide opening

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Then fall then summer
Before anyone walks across the opening

especially in a child
there was no walking along the pleasure

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I walk up and don’t work anymore

though it was most emphatically that
walking into percents blending themselves

which is all the time
