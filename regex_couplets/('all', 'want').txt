('all', 'want')

I’ll get there eventually
When I want something

Then fall then summer
I want to find a way to block it incoming

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
That’s exaclty what I want for them

especially in a child
I want but not to impart cynicism

Falling from this distance
I want to cite a poem so usual

though it was most emphatically that
I want to cite a poem

If you have confidence regardless all else
all that I can think I want

I take it out in the snow fall
