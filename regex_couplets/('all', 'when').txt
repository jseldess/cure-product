('all', 'When')

I’ll get there eventually
When I woke up in the morning

it was really sunny
When I want something

Then fall then summer
When we had jobs that were to earn

If you have confidence regardless all else
When they really take hold of my finger

That’s when they really take
When closed to my knowing

As a clone, illegally conceived
When I'm watching my tv 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
