('all', 'will')

I’ll get there eventually
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

Then fall then summer
on a day there will be direction

especially in a child
will not be the same

falling off the end of the world
that will spur me on

As a clone, illegally conceived
would only willingly break

all parties would be held
would speak willingly only

without really branding 
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

literally moved
my daughter will learn 

It’s not marshall exactly
