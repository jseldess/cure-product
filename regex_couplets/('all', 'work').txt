('all', 'work')

I’ll get there eventually
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
nor work in this way daily

Then fall then summer
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I see only the back of falling values
your bid to the next highest ranked network

They are called aspirational
I need the work

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I walk up and don’t work anymore

though it was most emphatically that
So I work and don’t look any

If you have confidence regardless all else
nor envy honest work

Which can be called confidence
