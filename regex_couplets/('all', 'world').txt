('all', 'world')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
off the edge of the world

Falling from this distance
Which can be pronounced to the world

Then fall then summer
The world 

though it was most emphatically that
off the end of the world

with internally regulated climate
hauling off the end of the world

all that I can think I want
falling off the end of the world

I take it out in the snow fall
the opinions in my world

without really branding
