('all', 'your')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling from this distance
May I have your zip code

Then fall then summer
your bid to the next highest ranked network

They are called aspirational
This is your voice 

though it was most emphatically that
This is your choice 

If you have confidence regardless all else
This is your chance

all parties would be helped
