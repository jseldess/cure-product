('along', 'any')

bring your child along
at any time it can drift again

The days lined along company
That company creates a life

there was no walking along the pleasure
there wasnâ€™t any television 

formerly along time they were on
The many transparent pixel calls

formerly along my say to the elections
or imagined anyway
