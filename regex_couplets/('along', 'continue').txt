('along', 'continue')

bring your child along
but it continued

The days lined along company
but it continued rippling muscle

there was no walking along the pleasure
no solid ground to continue along

there was no walking along
and continue along having 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
I continue to presume

formerly along time they were on
