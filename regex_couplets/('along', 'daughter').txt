('along', 'daughter')

bring your child along
I love my daughter still

there was no walking along the pleasure
with my daughter

formerly along time they were on
my daughter will learn 

formerly along my say to the elections
my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me

shone formerly along time
