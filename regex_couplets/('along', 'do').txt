('along', 'do')

bring your child along
What does it mean to drift

and bear children along
in a sharp downward turn 

The days lined along company
What I do in my liesure

there was no walking along the pleasure
I walk up and don’t work anymore

formerly along time they were on
and it doesn’t take long

along cables
I only think I don’t listen
