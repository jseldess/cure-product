('along', 'ending')

bring your child along
I tried to feel the key values extending 

The days lined along company
talking into pheasants bending themselves

there was no walking along the pleasure
talking into percents bending themselves

formerly along time they were on
battery dawn nights blending themselves

along cables
battery dawn nights ending themselves

shone formerly along time
