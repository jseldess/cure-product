('along', 'has')

bring your child along
It has been since

The days lined along company
in traversing my purchase

there was no walking along the pleasure
purchased out

formerly along time they were on
phase decisioned by the prospect

formerly along my say to the elections
phase decisioned

along cables
at the site of a purchase
