('along', 'he')

bring your child along
without imparting the cynicism

bearing children along
the drifting is not something special

The days lined along company
The days of public quantity

there was no walking along the pleasure
there was no promotion

there was no walking along
where you can earn more 

and continue along having 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

walking along the measure
walking from home along the measure

formerly along time they were on
I speak them of my possessions

formerly along my say to the elections
formerly my way to the elections

drawn formerly along 
time they were on

along cables
But my not feeling the memory aside

mostly along cables
where I am aside

shone formerly along time
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

formerly along the time they were on
My say to the elections
