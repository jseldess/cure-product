('along', 'here')

bring your child along
I’ll get there eventually

The days lined along company
that potential is there for you

there was no walking along the pleasure
there was no promotion

there was no walking along
where you can earn more 

and continue along having 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

walking along the measure
there wasn’t any television 

formerly along time they were on
Is there a baby and a bear

formerly along my say to the elections
where rights ended themselves

drawn formerly along 
By my memory elsewhere

along cables
where I am aside increased

mostly along cables
where I am aside

shone formerly along time
where lights blended themselves

formerly along the time they were on
my ethereal economic relations
