('along', 'move')

bring your child along
since I can imagine movement

The days lined along company
with little reason to move

there was no walking along the pleasure
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

formerly along time they were on
not literally moved about

along cables
also didnâ€™t really move

shone formerly along time
not literally moved
