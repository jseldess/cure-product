('along', 'now')

bring your child along
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

The days lined along company
I take it out in the snow fall

there was no walking along the pleasure
I even know what I would find

formerly along time they were on
who knows how to turn it off

formerly along my say to the elections
who knows the way

along cables
that their knowing
