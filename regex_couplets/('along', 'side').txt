('along', 'side')

bring your child along
aside from the retinas

The days lined along company
actually considering the end

formerly along time they were on
But my not feeling the memory inside

formerly along my say to the elections
But my not feeling the memory aside

along cables
where I am aside increased

mostly along cables
where I am aside

shone formerly along time
