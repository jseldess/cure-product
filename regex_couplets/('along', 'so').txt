('along', 'so')

bring your child along
who are so fresh and agile

The days lined along company
with little reason to aspiration

there was no walking along the pleasure
no solid ground to continue along

there was no walking along
than solid ground

because there was no solid ground to continue along
If I take some different measure

formerly along time they were on
by in the sound privacy

formerly along my say to the elections
by in the sounded privacy

along cables
also didnâ€™t really move

shone formerly along time
buy in the sound privacy
