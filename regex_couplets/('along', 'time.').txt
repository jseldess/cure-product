('along', 'time.')

bring your child along
over the long time up in the sky

The days lined along company
The long time I had a vision

there was no walking along the pleasure
without the long time I was accounting

formerly along time they were on
time they were on

formerly along my say to the elections
in the long time they were on

shone formerly along time
formerly along the time they were on
