('along', 'up?')

bring your child along
without imparting the cynicism

bearing children along
Puffs of air

The days lined along company
The days of public quantity

there was no walking along the pleasure
no solid ground to continue along

there was no walking along
where you can earn more 

and continue along having 
and support digestion

because there was no solid ground to continue along
walking along the measure

walking from home along the measure
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

formerly along time they were on
I presume to others

formerly along my say to the elections
I thought

drawn formerly along 
I assumed what I draw

along cables
But my not feeling the memory aside

mostly along cables
the least productive of myself

shone formerly along time
I answered what I thought

formerly along the time they were on
about
