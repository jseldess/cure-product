('along', 'us')

bring your child along
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

The days lined along company
So stay with us

there was no walking along the pleasure
because there was no solid ground to continue along

walking along the measure
I reuse indelible tracks 

formerly along time they were on
radiating from housing

shone formerly along time
I have them trust in me
