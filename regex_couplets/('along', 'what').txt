('along', 'what')

bring your child along
I invited most of what came next

The days lined along company
I even know what I would find

formerly along time they were on
I answered what I thought

formerly along my say to the elections
I assumed what I draw

along cables
I answered what I thought about

shone formerly along time
to return what I bought
