('along', 'you.')

bring your child along
You can hear it also through your leisure

The days lined along company
since you can imagine movement

there was no walking along the pleasure
where you can earn more 

and continue along having 
If you have confidence regardless all else

formerly along time they were on
the young ripples inaudibly
