('already', 'For')

So I presume the offers already
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

already formerly a long time
For Mitt Romney

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
For my own purchases

already formely a long time
Formerly a way like this one

already brought into privacy
For a while I think I don’t listen
