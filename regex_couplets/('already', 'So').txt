('already', 'so')

So I presume the offers already
I’ll pull myself another personality type

already formerly a long time
I want to cite a poem so usual

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
sound inundated for my own purchases

already formely a long time
and sound redundant

with dawn already formerly nights 
so still watch them

dawn already formerly nights 
by in the sound privacy

already brought into privacy
buy in the sound privacy

The prospects there already
and could be inflected with reasons
