('already', 'Thou')

So I presume the offers already
Though there are quarters goals

already formerly a long time
Though we are waiting for her

dawn already formerly nights 
Though we are breaking 

already formely a long time
Though we are waiting 

with dawn already formerly nights 
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

already brought into privacy
