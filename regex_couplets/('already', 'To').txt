('already', 'To')

So I presume the offers already
To my children Walt Whitman

already formerly a long time
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
To the ends of transactions

dawn already formerly nights 
To the ends of my transactions

already brought into privacy
