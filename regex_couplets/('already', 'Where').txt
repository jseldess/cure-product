('already', 'Where')

So I presume the offers already
Where official policy is to catch and release

already formerly a long time
Where in me did I host

dawn already formerly nights 
Where I host my purposes

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
Where in me did I last

already formely a long time
Where in me did I lose

already brought into privacy
