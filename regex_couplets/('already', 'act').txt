('already', 'act')

So I presume the offers already
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

already formerly a long time
to the ends of my transactions

dawn already formerly nights 
We had inhabited actually

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
The ends of my transactions

with dawn already formerly nights 
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

already brought into privacy
before I act on them
