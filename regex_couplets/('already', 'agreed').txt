So I presume the offers already
and to which I’ve agreed

already formerly a long time
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

with dawn already formerly nights 
that agreed one of rest

dawn already formerly nights 
and to which the plan agreed

already brought into privacy
that agreed to one the people

The prospects there already
