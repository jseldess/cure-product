('already', 'eat')

So I presume the offers already
too sunny to eat ice cream

already formerly a long time
was not just a defeat

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
for the creation of the universe

with dawn already formerly nights 
burrowed about from repeated travels

already brought into privacy
