('already', 'feeling')

So I presume the offers already
conversations with our feelings

already formerly a long time
But my not feeling the memory aside

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
But my not feeling the memory inside

with dawn already formerly nights 
By my feeling the memory inside

already brought into privacy
