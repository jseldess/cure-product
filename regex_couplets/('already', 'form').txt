So I presume the offers already
There are performance reviews

already formerly a long time
in the form filled offered in trust

dawn already formerly nights 
formerly a long time they were on

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
already formely a long time

with dawn already formerly nights 
in the form filled offered trust

already brought into privacy
own best form to ourselves

The prospects there already
