('already', 'has')

So I presume the offers already
conversations with our purchase

already formerly a long time
if that has anything

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
found dated for my own purchases

already formely a long time
For my own purchases

with dawn already formerly nights 
phase decisioned by the prospect

already brought into privacy
phase decisioned

The prospects there already
converting sight into a purchase
