('already', 'he')

So I presume the offers already
The prospects there already

already formerly a long time
to the ends of my transactions

dawn already formerly nights 
formerly a long time they were on

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
where I send and relive would be held

already formely a long time
I stand and retrieve the impulse

with dawn already formerly nights 
I speak to them my possessions

already brought into privacy
by the private preambles

The offers there already
The prospects being seen by me

So I resume the offers already
So I presume the offers

for a while to listen already
So I presume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home
