('already', 'literal')

So I presume the offers already
and literally moved

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
and literally unproved

already formely a long time
literally unproved 

already formerly a long time
myself moved literally as it is

with dawn already formerly nights 
and literally moved about

dawn already formerly nights 
not literally moved about

already brought into privacy
