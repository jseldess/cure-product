('already', 'man')

So I presume the offers already
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

already formerly a long time
They have very many choices

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
and that man comes on to tell me 

dawn already formerly nights 
The many transparent pixel calls

already brought into privacy
