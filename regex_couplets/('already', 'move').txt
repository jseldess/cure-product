('already', 'move')

So I presume the offers already
since I can imagine movement

already formerly a long time
and literally moved

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
myself moved literally as it is

with dawn already formerly nights 
and literally moved about

dawn already formerly nights 
not literally moved about

already brought into privacy
