('already', 'moved')

So I presume the offers already
and literally moved

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
myself moved literally as it is

already formerly a long time
and literally moved about

with dawn already formerly nights 
I literally moved

dawn already formerly nights 
not literally moved about

already brought into privacy
