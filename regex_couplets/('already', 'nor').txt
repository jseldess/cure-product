('already', 'nor')

So I presume the offers already
into the minority proportion of time

already formerly a long time
nor work in this way daily

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
which had on honor to be told

with dawn already formerly nights 
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

already brought into privacy
