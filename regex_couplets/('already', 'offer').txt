('already', 'offer')

So I presume the offers already
in the form filled offered in trust

already formerly a long time
in the form filled offered trust

dawn already formerly nights 
in track as offer asked 

already brought into privacy
I presume the offers

The prospects there already
The offers there already

So I resume the offers already
I offer to you

for a while to listen already
So I presume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home
