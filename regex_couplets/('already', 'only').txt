('already', 'only')

So I presume the offers already
only fragments of time with my children

already formerly a long time
only in the case

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
would only willingly break

with dawn already formerly nights 
if only on the way to the trash

already brought into privacy
I only think I don’t listen
