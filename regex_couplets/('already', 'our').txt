('already', 'our')

So I presume the offers already
reasons resources

already formerly a long time
Or alter of course the time anyway

dawn already formerly nights 
You can hear it also through your leisure

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
Who throws contours away

already brought into privacy
phrase them of our possessions

The prospects there already
