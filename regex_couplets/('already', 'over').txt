('already', 'over')

So I presume the offers already
I step over the edge

already formerly a long time
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
for not paying sound overwhelmed

with dawn already formerly nights 
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
