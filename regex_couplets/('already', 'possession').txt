('already', 'possession')

So I presume the offers already
I speak to them my possessions

with dawn already formerly nights 
my possession of my children

already formerly a long time
I speak them of my possessions

already brought into privacy
phrase them of our possessions

The prospects there already
Or can have seen offering possession
