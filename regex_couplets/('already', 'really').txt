('already', 'really')

So I presume the offers already
because it was really dark

already formerly a long time
without really agreeing

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
without really speaking

already formely a long time
without really breaking

with dawn already formerly nights 
without really needing

dawn already formerly nights 
also didn’t really move

already brought into privacy
