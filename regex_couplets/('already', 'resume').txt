('already', 'resume')

So I presume the offers already
and canâ€™t presume to need

already formerly a long time
I presume to others

dawn already formerly nights 
I presume the offers

The prospects there already
So I resume the offers already

for a while to listen already
So I presume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home
