('already', 'space')

So I presume the offers already
in rotating directionless space

already formerly a long time
in the space that it had

dawn already formerly nights 
though we are breaking in the space that it had

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
in the fill space 

already brought into privacy
