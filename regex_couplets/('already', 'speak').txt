('already', 'speak')

So I presume the offers already
not speaking

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
without really speaking

already formely a long time
I speak to them

already formerly a long time
I speak to them my possessions

with dawn already formerly nights 
I speak them of my possessions

dawn already formerly nights 
speak them of my possessions

already brought into privacy
