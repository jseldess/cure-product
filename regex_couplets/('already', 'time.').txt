('already', 'time.')

So I presume the offers already
Then I constellate my time family country

already formerly a long time
Or alter of course the time anyway

dawn already formerly nights 
formerly a long time they were on

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
until a happier time found

with dawn already formerly nights 
formerly along time they were on

already brought into privacy
