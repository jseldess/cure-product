('already', 'us')

So I presume the offers already
asynchronous 

already formerly a long time
in the form filled offered in trust

dawn already formerly nights 
I want to cite a poem so usual

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

already formely a long time
useless for not having paid

with dawn already formerly nights 
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

already brought into privacy
