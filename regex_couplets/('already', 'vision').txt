('already', 'vision')

So I presume the offers already
I had me a vision

already formerly a long time
there wasnâ€™t any television 

dawn already formerly nights 
joined in my television

already brought into privacy
visions that can be attainable

The prospects there already
revisions that can be attributable

So I resume the offers already
at home visions can be attainable

for a while to listen already
