('already', 'will')

So I presume the offers already
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

already formerly a long time
would only willingly break

with dawn already formerly nights 
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

dawn already formerly nights 
my daughter will learn 

already brought into privacy
