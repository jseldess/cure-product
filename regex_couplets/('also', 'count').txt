('also', 'count')

You can hear it also through your leisure
Then I constellate my time family country

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
without the long time I was accounting

I cannot clear it also through investiture
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
in the simple act of opening an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
So I constellate the time family country

also didnâ€™t really move
