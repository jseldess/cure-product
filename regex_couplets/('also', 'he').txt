('also', 'he')

You can hear it also through your leisure
The dogs and lillies

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
What was the last time

I cannot clear it also through investiture
up in the television pleasure

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I can hear them between bills and stuff

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in the simple act of reading

You can clear it also through static seizure
The simple act opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
You can hear it also through static leisure

You can clear it also through static leisure
talking into pheasants bending themselves

also didnâ€™t really move
By my memory elsewhere
