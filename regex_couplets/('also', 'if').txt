('also', 'if')

You can hear it also through your leisure
drifting away needs others presume desires

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
If I take a different measure

I cannot clear it also through investiture
If I take some different measure

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
if there is anything 

also didnâ€™t really move
if only on the way to the trash
