('also', 'many')

You can hear it also through your leisure
not many face up

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through investiture
in not many tracks up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Though in not many acts

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
They have very many choices

also didnâ€™t really move
