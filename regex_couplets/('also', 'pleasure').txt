('also', 'pleasure')

You can hear it also through your leisure
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
up in the television pleasure

I cannot clear it also through investiture
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
