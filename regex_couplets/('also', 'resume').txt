('also', 'resume')

You can hear it also through your leisure
and can’t presume to need

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
I resume unassimilable visions

I cannot clear it also through investiture
I resume indelible tracks

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I resume attributable visions

You can hear it also through static leisure
I continue to presume

also didn’t really move
So I presume the offers already
