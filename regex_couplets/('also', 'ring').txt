('also', 'ring')

You can hear it also through your leisure
bring your child along

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

also didnâ€™t really move
The prospect for veering healthily
