('also', 'static')

You can hear it also through your leisure
wrapped in static and explicit statements

I cannot clear it also through investiture
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
You can clear it also through static seizure

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure

You can clear it also through static siezure
You can hear it also through static leisure

You can clear it also through static leisure
wrapped in static

also didnâ€™t really move
