('also', 'television')

You can hear it also through your leisure
there wasn’t any television 

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
up in the television pleasure

I cannot clear it also through investiture
up in the television

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
there was no television to hear

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
joined in my television

also didn’t really move
