('also', 'time.')

You can hear it also through your leisure
where I sleep at times

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
The long time I had a vision

I cannot clear it also through investiture
without the long time I was accounting

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
So I constellate the time family country

also didnâ€™t really move
in the long time they were on
