('also', 'tracks')

You can hear it also through your leisure
I reuse indelible tracks 

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
I refuse indelible tracks

I cannot clear it also through investiture
I resume indelible tracks

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in not many tracks up in the sky

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
