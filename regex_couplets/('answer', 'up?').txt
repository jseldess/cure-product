('answer', 'up?')

for the duration of the answer
for the creation of the universe

answered about 
the duration of answers

for the duration of answers
But my not feeling the memory aside

by the sight of the hosting answered about
in the form filled offered trust

I answered about
which I feel formerly about for

washed I answered about
after though thereâ€™s no memory

I answered what I thought
I thought

at least for the duration of the answer
for the duration of the universe

I answered while interfaced
but for memory elsewhere

I answered what I thought about
but standing in memory
