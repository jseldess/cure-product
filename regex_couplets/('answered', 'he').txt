('answered', 'he')

answered about 
from cables reheated travels

by the sight of the hosting answered about
by the side of the hosting service

I answered about
washed

washed I answered about
washed by my memory

I answered what I thought
formerly my way to the elections

I answered while interfaced
battery dawn nights ending themselves

I answered what I thought about
in the long time they were on
