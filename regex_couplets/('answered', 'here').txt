('answered', 'here')

answered about 
where I send and relive

by the sight of the hosting answered about
Where in me did I loose

I answered about
By my memory elsewhere

washed I answered about
after though thereâ€™s no memory

I answered what I thought
where rights ended themselves

I answered while interfaced
but for memory elsewhere

I answered what I thought about
where lights blended themselves
