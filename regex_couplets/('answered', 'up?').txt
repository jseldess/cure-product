('answered', 'up?')

answered about 
the duration of answers

by the sight of the hosting answered about
in the form filled offered trust

I answered about
which I feel formerly about for

washed I answered about
after though thereâ€™s no memory

I answered what I thought
I thought

I answered while interfaced
but for memory elsewhere

I answered what I thought about
but standing in memory
