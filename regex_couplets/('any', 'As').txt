('any', 'As')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
As though stationary and a destination

at any time it can drift again
Assimilable or

Or the company
Aspirational strategy

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
As an extension of the values

That company creates a life
As a clone, illegally conceived

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
