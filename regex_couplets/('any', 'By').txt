('any', 'By')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
By being so concerned

Before anyone walks across the opening
By NATASHA SINGER

They have very many choices
By my memory elsewhere

The many transparent pixel calls
By my feeling the memory inside

or imagined anyway
