('any', 'Having')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Having transitioned from leisure to work

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
Having been purchased out of you

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Having seen more than 

if there is anything 
Having seen more than I can remember
