('any', 'One')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
One day there is direction

Before anyone walks across the opening
One day was actually

at any time it can drift again
One year or

Or the company
One was up where it should be down

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
