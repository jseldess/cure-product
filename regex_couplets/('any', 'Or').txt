('any', 'Or')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Or the company

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

there wasnâ€™t any television 
Or alter of course the time anyway

if there is anything 
Or can have seen offering possession
