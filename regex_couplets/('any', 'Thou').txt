('any', 'Thou')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Though there are quarters goals

at any time it can drift again
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

not many face up
Though in not many acts

Though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

Though it is not many simple acts
Though it is not a simple act

I walk up and don’t work anymore
Though we are waiting for her

Or alter of course the time anyway
Though we are breaking 

latency which doesn’t mean anything
Though we are waiting 

if there is anything 
Though we can’t help waiting

The many transparent pixel calls
