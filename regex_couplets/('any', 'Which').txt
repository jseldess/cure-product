('any', 'Which')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Which is a measure to never live out

at any time it can drift again
Which can be pronounced to the world

Or the company
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I walk up and don’t work anymore
Which can be called confidence

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

latency which doesn’t mean anything
