('any', 'above')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
hovering above standing water

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
Running above broadway

there wasnâ€™t any television 
behind or out front or up above

or imagined anyway
waiting out front or up above
