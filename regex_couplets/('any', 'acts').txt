('any', 'acts')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
I refuse indelible tracts

not many face up
though not many facts up in the sky

in not many tracks up in the sky
Though in not many acts

Though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

Though it is not many simple acts
