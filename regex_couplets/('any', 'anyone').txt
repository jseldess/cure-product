('any', 'anyone')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Before anyone buys up the opening
Before anyone walks across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the field

at any time it can drift again
