('any', 'aspiration')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
They are called aspirational

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
with little reasons to aspiration

The days aligned for company
embodied aspirations

The days aligned long company
with little reason to aspiration

That company creates a life
full of aspirations

there wasnâ€™t any television
