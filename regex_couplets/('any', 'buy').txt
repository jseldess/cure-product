('any', 'buy')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Before anyone buys up the opening

Before anyone walks across the opening
We had to buy there

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
buy in the surrounded privacy

The many transparent pixel calls
buy in the sound privacy
