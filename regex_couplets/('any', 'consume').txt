('any', 'consume')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
I continue to consume

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I could consume the dream

there wasnâ€™t any television 
without consumer damage

without any further damage
to any consumer damage

without any longer damage
