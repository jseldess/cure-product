('any', 'continue')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
but it continued

The entire company
but it continued rippling muscle

That company creates a life
no solid ground to continue along

there wasnâ€™t any television 
I continue to presume

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I continue to consume

without any further damage
I continued to dream then

without any longer damage
