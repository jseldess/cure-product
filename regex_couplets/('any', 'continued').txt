('any', 'continued')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
but it continued

The entire company
but it continued rippling muscle

That company creates a life
Then I continued to dream then

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I continued to dream then

without any further damage
