('any', 'decision')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
the planning process for decisions

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
attributable decisions

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
forgetting decisions 

if there is anything 
decisioned to learn 

The many transparent pixel calls
decisioned to learn back

or imagined anyway
decisions that can be attributable
