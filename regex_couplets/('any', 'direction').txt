('any', 'direction')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Of course there is a direction

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
One day there is direction

Before anyone walks across the opening
on a day there will be direction

at any time it can drift again
stopping off in all directions
