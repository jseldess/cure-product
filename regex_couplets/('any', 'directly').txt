('any', 'directly')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
if not directly on my skin

Before anyone walks across the opening
of not directly from my skin

at any time it can drift again
But not to me directly

Or the company
The sun high enough to enter directly 

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
The sun high enough to strike directly
