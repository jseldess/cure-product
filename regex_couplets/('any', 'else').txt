('any', 'else')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
If you have confidence regardless all else

Or the company
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

there wasn’t any television 
and elsewhere my memory

They have very many choices
elsewhere my purposes

latency which doesn’t mean anything
elsewhere by my memory

The many transparent pixel calls
By my memory elsewhere

or imagined anyway
