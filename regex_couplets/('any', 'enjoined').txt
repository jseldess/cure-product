('any', 'enjoined')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
I was enjoined to act again myself

at any time it can drift again
I was enjoined to act again

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I was enjoined to act

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I am enjoined to act again

The entire company
I was enjoined to act against

The days aligned for company
