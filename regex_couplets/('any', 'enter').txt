('any', 'enter')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
I have entered my phone

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
The sun high enough to enter directly 

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
I enter the flattening mirror

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I have entered my purposes

They have very many choices
I had entered my phone

or imagined anyway
