('any', 'far')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
as far as I can see

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
as far back as my history heard

not many face up
for to tire as far back as my history

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
in welfare and hope

or imagined anyway
