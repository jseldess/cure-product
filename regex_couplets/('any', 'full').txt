('any', 'full')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
It keeps coming down thankfully

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
I am full of potential

The days aligned for company
with full potential to movement

The days aligned long company
full of aspirations

That company creates a life
full of potential

there wasnâ€™t any television 
full of the missing words

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
still carefully

The many transparent pixel calls
