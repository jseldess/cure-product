('any', 'has')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
conversations with our purchase

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Before anyone has walked across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the field
It has been since

at any time it can drift again
in traversing my purchase

there wasn’t any television 
purchased out

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I tell you the weight of my purchases

without any further damage
if that has anything

Or alter of course the time anyway
I have entered my purchases

They have very many choices
washed my purchases

latency which doesn’t mean anything
phase decisioned by the prospect

The many transparent pixel calls
phase decisioned

or imagined anyway
at the site of a purchase
