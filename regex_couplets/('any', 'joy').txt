('any', 'joy')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
I was enjoying acting against myself

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
a futile joyous white sun

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

or alter of course the time anyway
