('any', 'know')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
who knows the way

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
how can I know without direction

at any time it can drift again
I even know what I would find

not many face up
even when close to my knowing

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
knowing the constituents

latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything
who knows how to turn it off

The many transparent pixel calls
who know the way to their other end

The many transparent pixels call
that their knowing
