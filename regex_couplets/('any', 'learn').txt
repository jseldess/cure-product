('any', 'learn')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
in light of learning what we see

Before anyone buys up the opening
I spend time online learning to code

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
decisioned to learn 

if there is anything 
decisioned to learn back

The many transparent pixel calls
phase decision for learning

or imagined anyway
I learned my location
