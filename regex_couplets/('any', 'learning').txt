('any', 'learning')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
in light of learning what we see

Before anyone buys up the opening
I spend time online learning to code

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
phase decision for learning

The many transparent pixel calls
for learning by the prospect

or imagined anyway
a precision for learning
