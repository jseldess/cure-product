('any', 'let')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
But I can’t let myself treat 

at any time it can drift again
I let myself treat

Or the company
It’s the third letter from the end

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I let it remind me again

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
