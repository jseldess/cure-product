('any', 'man')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

at any time it can drift again
To my children Walt Whitman

Or the company
not many face up

though not many freeze up
though not many face up

though not many facts up in the sky
in not many tracks up in the sky

Though in not many acts
Though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts
Though it is not many simple acts

I walk up and don’t work anymore
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
They have very many choices

latency which doesn’t mean anything
and that man comes on to tell me 

there wasn’t any television 
The many transparent pixel calls

The many transparent pixels call
of the many transparent pixel calls

or imagined anyway
