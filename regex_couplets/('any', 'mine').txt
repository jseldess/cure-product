('any', 'mine')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
They’re just not mine

at any time it can drift again
The third letter from the end is mine

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
The ads in mine

there wasn’t any television 
To the right of determined elections

or imagined anyway
