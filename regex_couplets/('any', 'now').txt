('any', 'now')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
on a snow day with my children

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

at any time it can drift again
Right now I’m the cart

Or the company
out in the snow

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I take it out in the snow fall

there wasn’t any television 
I even know what I would find

not many face up
even when close to my knowing

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
knowing the constituents

latency which doesn’t mean anything
who knows the way

The many transparent pixel calls
who know the way to their other end

The many transparent pixels call
that their knowing
