('any', 'opening')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Before we walk across the wide opening

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Before anyone buys up the opening

Before anyone walks across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the field
The simple act opening surmounted

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
