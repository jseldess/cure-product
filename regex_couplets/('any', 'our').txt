('any', 'our')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
conversations with our purchase

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
conversations with our reactions

Before anyone buys up the opening
Of course there is a direction

Before anyone walks across the opening
You can hear it also through your leisure

at any time it can drift again
reasons resources

Or the company
or an available resource

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
with four key value pairs

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
or alter of course the time anyway

if there is anything 
This is your voice 

They have very many choices
Who throws contours away

The many transparent pixel calls
phrase them of our possessions
