('any', 'plan')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
and is relentlessly planned

at any time it can drift again
The planning process for visions

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
and for which the plan agreed

latency which doesn’t mean anything
and to which the plan agreed

there wasn’t any television
