('any', 'potential')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Before anyone walks across the opening
I am full of potential

The days aligned for company
with full potential to movement

The days aligned long company
full of potential

That company creates a life
that potential is there for you

there wasnâ€™t any television
