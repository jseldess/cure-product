('any', 'pure')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
What is an impure product

Before anyone buys up the opening
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

at any time it can drift again
as a pure product

Or the company
