('any', 'story')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Forecasting the story before dawn

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
as far back as my history heard

not many face up
You need history

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
