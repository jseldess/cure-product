('any', 'than')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
It keeps coming down thankfully

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
than in the incoming stream

before anyone has walked across the opening
than solid ground

there wasnâ€™t any television 
Having seen more than 

if there is anything 
Having seen more than I can remember
