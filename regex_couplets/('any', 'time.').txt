('any', 'time.')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
only fragments of time with my children

at any time it can drift again
Then I constellate my time family country

Or the company
I spend time online learning to code

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
The long time I had a vision

there wasn’t any television 
without the long time I was accounting

not many face up
So I constellate the time family country

I walk up and don’t work anymore
The long time I was a vision

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
or alter of course the time anyway

if there is anything 
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

They have very many choices
until a happier time found

latency which doesn’t mean anything
formerly a long time they were on

if that has anything
formerly along time they were on

The many transparent pixel calls
time they were on

or imagined anyway
in the long time they were on
