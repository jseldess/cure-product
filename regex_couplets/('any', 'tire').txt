('any', 'tire')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
The entire company

Since I had to hold the entire company
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

The days aligned for company
until I could not tire 

though not many facts up in the sky
until I could not be tired

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
for to tire as far back as my history

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

or alter of course the time anyway
