('any', 'too')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
too sunny to eat ice cream

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
emerging this year from too much standing water

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
Selma knows too 

The many transparent pixel calls
