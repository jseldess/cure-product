('any', 'trying')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
when trying to feel the extension of key values

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
that I hear without trying

not many face up
wearing trying talking into it

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I spun around trying to touch the spots

without any further damage
