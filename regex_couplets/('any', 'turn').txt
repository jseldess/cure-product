('any', 'turn')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
In a sharp downard turn

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
in a sharp downward turn 

at any time it can drift again
sudden downward turn

Or the company
I keep turning back

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
who knows how to turn it off

The many transparent pixel calls
I turn not sad exactly

or imagined anyway
I returned not sad exactly
