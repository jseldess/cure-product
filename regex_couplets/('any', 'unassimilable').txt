('any', 'unassimilable')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
an unassimilable desire against me

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I reuse unassimilable visions

there wasnâ€™t any television 
I resume unassimilable visions

not many face up
