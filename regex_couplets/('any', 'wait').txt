('any', 'wait')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
There are spots waiting

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Though we are waiting for her

Or alter of course the time anyway
not needing to wait

latency which doesn’t mean anything
Though we are waiting 

if there is anything 
Though we can’t help waiting

The many transparent pixel calls
waiting out front or up above
