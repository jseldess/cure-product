('any', 'walk')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Before we walk across the wide field

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Before anyone walks across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the field

at any time it can drift again
there was no walking along the pleasure

there wasn’t any television 
I walk up and don’t work anymore

So I look up and don’t walk any
walking into percents blending themselves

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
