('any', 'weight')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
I tell you the weight of my purchases

there wasnâ€™t any television 
I tell you the weight of my purposes

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
weight of my purposes

without any further damage
The weight kept moaned impression
