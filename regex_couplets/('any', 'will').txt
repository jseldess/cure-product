('any', 'will')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

at any time it can drift again
will not be the same

not many face up
that will spur me on

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
would only willingly break

latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

The many transparent pixel calls
my daughter will learn 

or imagined anyway
