('any', 'you.')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Though how can you know without direction

at any time it can drift again
bring your child along

Or the company
That you can see only the back of

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
since you can imagine movement

The days aligned for company
where you can earn more 

there wasn’t any television 
You can hear it also through your leisure

I walk up and don’t work anymore
If you have confidence regardless all else

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I tell you my purposes

without any further damage
a futile joyous white sun

or alter of course the time anyway
This is your voice 

They have very many choices
the young ripples inaudibly
