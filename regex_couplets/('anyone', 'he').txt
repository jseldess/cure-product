('anyone', 'he')

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
In the light of retroactive

Before anyone buys up the opening
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Before anyone walks across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the field
from the incoming stream
