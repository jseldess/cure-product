('architecture', 'up?')

low in the content architecture
Where I put it beating

Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
of later ruins

high in the content architecture
out from below the fold

high up in the architecture
where I can claim to see the ruins

high up in the content architecture
And as an extension of the values
