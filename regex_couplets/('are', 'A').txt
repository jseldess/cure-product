Though there are quarters goals
Actually one day there is direction

there are quarters 
And as an extension of the values

barely outlines
After having been contented

They are called aspirational
ASPIRATING VISIONS

The days are long
As an extension of the values

but they are black spots
All that I can think I want

There are spots waiting
And from a great distance

Though we are waiting for her
And we could inhabit the room easy

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
A baby and a bear

though we are breaking in the space that it had
All parties would be held for my own purchases

Though we are breaking 
All parties would be held

Though we are waiting 
CONTRACT

still carefully
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

There are constant ways
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

Formerly away there are constant ways
A way I was going

That are my right to say
Aligned or not with my interests

careening between the preambles
