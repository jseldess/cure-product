('are', 'Bach')

Though there are quarters goals
I end up in Bach 

though we are waiting for her
I end up in Bach and Selma

There are constant ways
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

The many transparent pixel calls
and end up in Bach

There are no constant ways
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

Formerly away there are constant ways
I end up Bach

That are my right to say
