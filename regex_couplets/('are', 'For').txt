('are', 'For')

Though there are quarters goals
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

who are so fresh and agile
Forecasting the story before dawn

barely outlines
For an ungraspable time

There are spots waiting
For Mitt Romney

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
For my own purchases

Though we are breaking 
Formerly a way like this one

Though we are waiting for her
Formerly away there are constant ways

The many transparent pixel calls
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

There are constant ways
Forty-one seconds in

That are my right to say
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

careening between the preambles
