('are', 'My')

Though there are quarters goals
My associations

The days are long
My purpose up in the sky

There are spots waiting
My means without gravity

Though we are waiting for her
My daughter with her way

There are constant ways
My say to the elections

That are my right to say
My interesting politics

careening between the preambles
