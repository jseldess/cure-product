('are', 'There')

Though there are quarters goals
There are quarterly goals

There are performance reviews
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

barely outlines
There was very little physical activity

I had nightmares though
There are spots waiting

Though we are waiting for her
There are constant ways

Formerly away there are constant ways
There are no constant waves

There are no constant ways
