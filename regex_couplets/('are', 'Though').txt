('are', 'though')

Though there are quarters goals
As though stationary and a destination

there are quarters 
though there are quarters with goals

who are so fresh and agile
though it was most emphatically that

barely outlines
I had nightmares though

The days are long
though not many freeze up

There are spots waiting
I thought

Though we are waiting for her
though we are still breaking in

though we are breaking in the space that it had
after though thereâ€™s no memory

 still carefully
I answered what I thought

That are my right to say
