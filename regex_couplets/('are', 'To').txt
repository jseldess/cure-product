('are', 'To')

Though there are quarters goals
To my children Walt Whitman

who are so fresh and agile
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

barely outlines
Tomorrow 

They are called aspirational
Toward the start informally given my reasons

There are spots waiting
To neither study

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
To the ends of transactions

though we are waiting for her
To the ends of my transactions

There are constant ways
To the other end of transactions

There are no constant ways
To the other end of my actions

Formerly away there are constant ways
To the other end of transactions like this

That are my right to say
To the right of determined elections

careening between the preambles
