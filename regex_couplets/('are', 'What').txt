('are', 'what')

Though there are quarters goals
what I find there

who are so fresh and agile
I invited most of what came next

I had nightmares though
I even know what I would find

I believe I can prepare for it
what literally moved

still carefully
In what part did I lose trust

though we are waiting for her
I answered what I thought

That are my right to say
to return what I bought

careening between the preambles
