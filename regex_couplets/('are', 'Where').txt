('are', 'Where')

Though there are quarters goals
Where official policy is to catch and release

barely outlines
Where I take my liesure

but they are black spots
Where I lead gravity

There are spots waiting
Where I need gravity

Though we are waiting for her
Where in me did I host

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
Where in me did I last

Though we are breaking
Where in me did I lose

still carefully
Where in me pre-worn

There are constant ways
