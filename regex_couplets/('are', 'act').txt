('are', 'act')

Though there are quarters goals
I was enjoined to act again myself

barely outlines
and strategies not tactics

They are called aspirational
I am bid to act again

The days are long
There was very little physical activity

I had nightmares though
actually considering the end

There are spots waiting
we had inhabited actually

Though we are waiting for her
to the ends of my transactions

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
The ends of my transactions

Though we are waiting 
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

still carefully
To the ends of transactions

There are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

The many transparent pixel calls
The other ends of my transactions

There are no constant ways
The other end of my transactions

Formerly away there are constant ways
To the other end of transactions like this

That are my right to say
I return not sad exactly

careening between the preambles
before I act on them
