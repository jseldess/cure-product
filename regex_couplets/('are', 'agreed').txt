('are', 'agreed')

Though there are quarters goals
and to which I’ve agreed

Though we are waiting for her
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

Though we are breaking 
and for which the plan agreed

Though we are waiting 
that agreed one of rest

still carefully
that agreed home

careening between the preambles
