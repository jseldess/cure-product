('are', 'along')

Though there are quarters goals
bring your child along

who are so fresh and agile
The days lined along company

The days are long
there was no walking along the pleasure

but they are black spots
formerly along time they were on

though we are waiting for her
formerly along my say to the elections

That are my right to say
