('are', 'any')

Though there are quarters goals
at any time it can drift again

who are so fresh and agile
Or the company

barely outlines
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The days are long
The days aligned for company

I had nightmares though
The days aligned long company

but they are black spots
not many face up

There are spots waiting
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Though we are waiting for her
Or alter of course the time anyway

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
They have very many choices

though we are still breaking in
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

Though we are waiting 
if there is anything 

still carefully
The many transparent pixel calls

The many transparent pixels call
of the many transparent pixel calls

There are no constant waves
or imagined anyway

careening between the preambles
