('are', 'around')

Though there are quarters goals
Spinning around the heart

barely outlines
around my country 

There are spots waiting
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Though we are waiting for her
More reasons around my country 

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

Though we are waiting 
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

There are constant ways
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

The many transparent pixel calls
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

There are no constant ways
