('are', 'away')

Though there are quarters goals
drifting away needs others presume desires

who are so fresh and agile
drifting away

There are quarterly goals
drifting away from the task

barely outlines
Who throws contours away

There are constant ways
Formerly away there are constant ways

The many transparent pixel calls
formerly away

That are my right to say
