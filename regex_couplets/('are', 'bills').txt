('are', 'bills')

Though there are quarters goals
I hear it between bills and stuff

barely outlines
I can hear it between bills and stuff

but they are black spots
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I believe I can prepare for it
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

There are spots waiting
between bills and stuffed animals

careening between the preambles
