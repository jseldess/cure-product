('are', 'brought')

Though there are quarters goals
I brought my head down

barely outlines
own stays brought loyal

Though we are waiting for her
own that stays brought loyal

There are constant ways
that stays brought loyal

That are my right to say
at home brought into privacy

careening between the preambles
