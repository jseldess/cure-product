('are', 'but')

Though there are quarters goals
but not impart cynicism

who are so fresh and agile
Attributable or

barely outlines
but the sun isnâ€™t up

They are called aspirational
but it continued

The days are long
but it continued rippling muscle

but they are black spots
but I can hear them

There are spots waiting
that decisions can be attributable

though we are waiting for her
but for memory elsewhere

That are my right to say
decisions that can be attributable

careening between the preambles
revisions that can be attributable
