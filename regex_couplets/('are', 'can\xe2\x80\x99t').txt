('are', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

Though there are quarters goals
I can’t fix them without direction

there are quarters 
and can’t presume to need

who are so fresh and agile
Then I can’t presume to need others

barely outlines
That can’t be glimpsed

They are called aspirational
Though we can’t help waiting

Though we are waiting for her
I can’t remember them

careening between the preambles
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
