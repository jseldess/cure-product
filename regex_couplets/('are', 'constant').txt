('are', 'constant')

Though there are quarters goals
with constant ways 

Though we are waiting for her
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

There are constant ways
Formerly away there are constant ways

The many transparent pixel calls
with no constant waves

There are no constant waves
There are no constant ways

That are my right to say
