('are', 'dawn')

Though there are quarters goals
Forecasting the story before dawn

barely outlines
battery dawn nights blending themselves

There are spots waiting
dawn already formerly nights 

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
dawn formerly

Though we are waiting 
with dawn already formerly nights 

Though we are waiting for her
battery dawn nights 

There are constant ways
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

The many transparent pixel calls
to the other end battery dawn 

That are my right to say
