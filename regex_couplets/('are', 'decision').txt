('are', 'decision')

Though there are quarters goals
the planning process for decisions

They are called aspirational
attributable decisions

There are spots waiting
forgetting decisions 

Though we are waiting for her
decisioned to learn 

There are constant ways
decisioned to learn back

That are my right to say
decisions that can be attributable

careening between the preambles
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
