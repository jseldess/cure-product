('are', 'do')

Though there are quarters goals
does not feel an exception

who are so fresh and agile
in a sharp downward turn 

There are quarterly goals
to the down arrow

barely outlines
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

They are called aspirational
What I do in my liesure

but they are black spots
I walk up and don’t work anymore

There are spots waiting
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

Though we are waiting for her
and it doesn’t take long

Though we are waiting 
latency which doesn’t mean anything

still carefully
I only think I don’t listen

careening between the preambles
