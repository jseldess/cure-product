('are', 'edge')

Though there are quarters goals
The edge is put in place

there are quarters 
I step off the edge

though there are quarters with goals
If I step on the edge

who are so fresh and agile
off the edge of the world

There are quarterly goals
Face falling off the edge of the face

barely outlines
and testing the edge and gravity

They are called aspirational
