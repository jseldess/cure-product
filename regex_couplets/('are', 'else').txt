('are', 'else')

Though there are quarters goals
If you have confidence regardless all else

barely outlines
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

There are spots waiting
and elsewhere my memory

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
elsewhere my purposes

though we are still breaking in
elsewhere by my memory

still carefully
By my memory elsewhere

though we are waiting for her
in memory elsewhere

That are my right to say
