('are', 'fall')

Though there are quarters goals
Then fall then summer

who are so fresh and agile
and not falling at all

There are quarterly goals
Face falling off the edge of the face

barely outlines
I see only the back of falling values

They are called aspirational
falling off the encoded end

but they are black spots
I take it out in the snow fall

I believe I can prepare for it
falling off the end of the world

There are spots waiting
