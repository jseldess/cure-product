('are', 'feel')

Though there are quarters goals
does not feel an exception

who are so fresh and agile
I tried to feel the key values extending 

They are called aspirational
I tried to feel the extension of key values

The days are long
What would I feel without that goal

but they are black spots
But my not feeling the memory aside

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
But my not feeling the memory inside

Though we are waiting 
which feels most comfortable

Though we are waiting for her
which feels more comfortable

still carefully
which I feel formerly about for

There are constant ways
By my feeling the memory inside

Formerly away there are constant ways
But my feeling the memory aside

That are my right to say
