('are', 'form')

Though there are quarters goals
There are performance reviews

barely outlines
Toward the start informally given my reasons

There are spots waiting
already formerly a long time

Though we are waiting for her
dawn already formerly nights 

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
A way formerly like this one

though we are breaking in the space that it had
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

Though we are breaking 
already formely a long time

Though we are waiting 
in the form filled offered in trust

still carefully
in the form filled offered trust

There are constant ways
formerly a way

That are my right to say
which I feel formerly about for

careening between the preambles
