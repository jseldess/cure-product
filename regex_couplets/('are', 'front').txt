('are', 'front')

Though there are quarters goals
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

barely outlines
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

They are called aspirational
in front of the set of regulations

The days are long
And need out in front purchase

There are spots waiting
behind or out front or up above

careening between the preambles
