('are', 'goals')

Though there are quarters goals
We can wrestle them with their goals

there are quarters 
We can rest there in them with their goals

though there are quarters with goals
with goals I find there

who are so fresh and agile
There are quarterly goals

There are performance reviews
before morning goals

barely outlines
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

They are called aspirational
not goals

The days are long
