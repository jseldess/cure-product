('are', 'going')

Though there are quarters goals
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

but they are black spots
The way that she is going

though we are breaking in the space that it had
The way that I am going

Though we are waiting for her
The way that I was going

There are constant ways
way I was going 

That are my right to say
