('are', 'have')

Though there are quarters goals
if you have providence to excess

barely outlines
If you have confidence regardless all else

There are spots waiting
I have a memory between the day

Though we are waiting for her
I have entered my purposes

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
I have entered my phone

though we are still breaking in
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

still carefully
I have turned it off

There are constant ways
and have no way

Formerly away there are constant ways
I have them lost

careening between the preambles
I have seen more than I can remember
