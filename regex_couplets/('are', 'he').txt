('are', 'he')

Though there are quarters goals
Theyâ€™re just not mine

there are quarters 
We can wrestle them with their goals

though there are quarters with goals
with goals I find there

who are so fresh and agile
the drifting is not something special

There are quarterly goals
There are performance reviews

barely outlines
Then I cannot see face value

They are called aspirational
your bid to the next highest ranked network

The days are long
across the retinas

I had nightmares though
that I was the arm of this

but they are black spots
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I believe I can prepare for it
will not be the same

There are spots waiting
until I purchase up in the sky

Though we are waiting for her
to the ends of my transactions

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
elsewhere my purposes

though we are still breaking in
The way that she is going

though we are breaking in the space that it had
where I send and relive would be held

Though we are breaking 
I stand and retrieve the impulse

Though we are waiting 
all parties would be held

still carefully
Where in me pre-worn

There are constant ways
The other end of means

Formerly away there are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

The many transparent pixel calls
who know the way to their other end

The many transparent pixels call
to the other end

of the many transparent pixel calls
But my not feeling the memory inside

There are no constant waves
The other ends of my transactions

There are no constant ways
The other end of my transactions

That are my right to say
the right of my elections

 as points which are my interest 
I stay the right of my elections

careening between the preambles
The prospect for careening attached

The prospect for careening healthily
between the preambles
