('are', 'hear')

Though there are quarters goals
You can hear it also through your leisure

who are so fresh and agile
and my heart rate

barely outlines
I hear it between bills and stuff

The days are long
I can hear it between bills and stuff

but they are black spots
as far back as my history heard

I believe I can prepare for it
that I can hear

There are spots waiting
In my heart did I lose trust

though we are waiting for her
