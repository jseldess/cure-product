('are', 'here')

Though there are quarters goals
Actually one day there is direction

there are quarters 
We can rest there in them with their goals

though there are quarters with goals
with goals I find there

who are so fresh and agile
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

There are quarterly goals
There are performance reviews

barely outlines
there was no promotion

The days are long
There was very little physical activity

I had nightmares though
that potential is there for you

but they are black spots
Where I take my liesure

I believe I can prepare for it
there was no television to hear

There are spots waiting
or in some imaginary elsewhere

Though we are waiting for her
Where in me did I host

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
elsewhere my purposes

though we are still breaking in
where I send and relive would be held

Though we are breaking 
where I send and relive aside

Though we are waiting 
if there is anything 

still carefully
Where in me pre-worn

There are constant ways
Formerly away there are constant ways

The many transparent pixel calls
There are no constant waves

There are no constant ways
where rights ended themselves

That are my right to say
my ethereal economic relations

 as points which are my interest 
I learned the point where I am

careening between the preambles
