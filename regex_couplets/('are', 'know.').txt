('are', 'know.')

Though there are quarters goals
how can I know without direction

there are quarters 
Though how can you know without direction

though there are quarters with goals
for how can you know without direction

who are so fresh and agile
I even know what I would find

I believe I can prepare for it
even when close to my knowing

There are spots waiting
knowing the constituents

Though we are waiting 
who knows the way

 still carefully
who knows how to turn it off

Though we are waiting for her
who know the ways to their other end

The many transparent pixel calls
who know the way to their other end

The many transparent pixels call
that their knowing

careening between the preambles
