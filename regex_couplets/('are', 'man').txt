('are', 'man')

Though there are quarters goals
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

who are so fresh and agile
Walt Whitman drifted

There are quarterly goals
There are performance reviews

barely outlines
not many face up

There are spots waiting
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

Though we are waiting for her
They have very many choices

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
and that man comes on to tell me 

still carefully
The many transparent pixel calls

The many transparent pixels call
of the many transparent pixel calls

There are no constant waves
