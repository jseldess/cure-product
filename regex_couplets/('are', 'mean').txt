('are', 'mean')

Though there are quarters goals
What does it mean to drift

who are so fresh and agile
My means without gravity

Though we are waiting for her
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

Though we are waiting 
The other end of means

Formerly away there are constant ways
To the other end of means like this one

That are my right to say
