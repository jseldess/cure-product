('are', 'move')

Though there are quarters goals
since I can imagine movement

The days are long
with little reason to move

I had nightmares though
with full potential to movement

but they are black spots
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

There are spots waiting
and literally moved

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
myself moved literally as it is

Though we are waiting 
I move

Though we are waiting for her
and literally moved about

still carefully
not literally moved about

There are constant ways
also didnâ€™t really move

That are my right to say
not literally moved

careening between the preambles
