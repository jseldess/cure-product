('are', 'need')

Though there are quarters goals
and can’t presume to need

who are so fresh and agile
drifting away needs

There are quarterly goals
Then I can’t presume to need others

barely outlines
I need the work

There are spots waiting
I tell you where I need gravity

Though we are waiting for her
not needing to wait

Though we are waiting 
without really needing

still carefully
in need one in that best own

There are constant ways
need one in best own

That are my right to say
that in need one best own

careening between the preambles
