('are', 'no')

Though there are quarters goals
They’re just not mine

there are quarters 
Though how can you know without direction

though there are quarters with goals
or not even rotating

who are so fresh and agile
the drifting is not something special

There are quarterly goals
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

barely outlines
Then I cannot see face value

They are called aspirational
and strategies not tactics

The days are long
there was no promotion

but they are black spots
may not be engrained

I believe I can prepare for it
will not be the same

There are spots waiting
that nothing had gravity

Though we are waiting for her
The sun high enough to enter directly

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
not speaking

though we are breaking in the space that it had
But my not feeling the memory aside

Though we are breaking 
But my not feeling the memory inside

Though we are waiting 
and it’s not literal

still carefully
who knows the way

There are constant ways
with no constant way

The many transparent pixel calls
who know the way to their other end

The many transparent pixels call
with no constant waves

There are no constant waves
There are no constant ways

Formerly away there are constant ways
I end up in Bach with no way 

That are my right to say
between cereal and economic

 as points which are my interest 
Aligned or not with my interests

careening between the preambles
in that I cannot remember
