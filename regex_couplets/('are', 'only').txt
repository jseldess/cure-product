('are', 'only')

Though there are quarters goals
only in the case

barely outlines
So that I notice I am the only one

They are called aspirational
The planning process is for visionaries only

The days are long
would only willingly break

Though we are waiting 
if only on the way to the trash

careening between the preambles
less only money

The prospect for careening healthily
