('are', 'other')

Though there are quarters goals
others desires

who are so fresh and agile
I’ll pull myself another personality type

There are quarterly goals
Then I can’t presume to need others

barely outlines
On the other hand

There are spots waiting
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

Though we are waiting for her
and other types of tracking technology

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
I presume to others

still carefully
to the other end

There are constant ways
The other end of means

Formerly away there are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

The many transparent pixel calls
who know the way to their other end

The many transparent pixels call
The other ends of my transactions

There are no constant ways
The other end of my transactions

That are my right to say
Cereal and others’ health

 as points which are my interest 
I assume possession to others
