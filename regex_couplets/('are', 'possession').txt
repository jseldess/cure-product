('are', 'possession')

Though there are quarters goals
I speak to them my possessions

Though we are waiting for her
my possession of my children

still carefully
I speak them of my possessions

There are constant ways
speech my possession of my children

That are my right to say
I stay the right of my possessions 

careening between the preambles
Or can have seen offering possession
