('are', 'presume')

Though there are quarters goals
and can’t presume to need

who are so fresh and agile
Then I can’t presume to need others

barely outlines
I continue to presume

There are spots waiting
I presume to others

Though we are waiting for her
So I presume the offers already

careening between the preambles
I presume the offers
