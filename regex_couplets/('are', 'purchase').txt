('are', 'purchase')

Though there are quarters goals
in traversing my purchase

but they are black spots
purchased out

There are spots waiting
until I purchase up in the sky

Though we are waiting for her
I have entered my purchases

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
washed my purchases

though we are still breaking in
for my own purchases

though we are breaking in the space that it had
found dated for my own purchases

Though we are breaking 
impulse for my own purchases

Though we are waiting 
converting sight into a purchase

There are constant ways
the impulse for my own purchases

That are my right to say
at the site of a purchase

careening between the preambles
