('are', 'purpose')

Though there are quarters goals
by no ventillation my purpose

barely outlines
until my purpose up in the sky

They are called aspirational
until I purpose the horizon

There are spots waiting
I tell you my purposes

Though we are waiting for her
Where I host my purposes

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
elsewhere my purposes

though we are still breaking in
the impulse for my own purposes

Though we are breaking 
the impulse to my purpose

Though we are waiting 
to the other end of my purpose

That are my right to say
for my own purposes

careening between the preambles
