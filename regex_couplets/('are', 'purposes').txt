('are', 'purposes')

Though there are quarters goals
I tell you my purposes

There are spots waiting
I tell you the weight of my purposes

Though we are waiting for her
Where I host my purposes

elsewhere my purposes

though we are still breaking in
the impulse for my own purposes

Though we are breaking 
for my own purposes

careening between the preambles
