('are', 'really')

Though there are quarters goals
When they really take hold of my finger

barely outlines
without really agreeing

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
without really speaking

though we are breaking in the space that it had
without really breaking

Though we are waiting 
without really binding

Though we are waiting for her
without really needing

still carefully
also didnâ€™t really move

That are my right to say
