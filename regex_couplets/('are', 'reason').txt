('are', 'reason')

Though there are quarters goals
reasons resources

who are so fresh and agile
with reasons

barely outlines
with little reason to move

I had nightmares though
with little reasons to aspiration

with little reason to aspiration

but they are black spots
Toward the start informally given my reasons

There are spots waiting
More reasons around my country

careening between the preambles
