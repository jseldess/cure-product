('are', 'reasons')

Though there are quarters goals
reasons resources

who are so fresh and agile
with reasons

barely outlines
with little reasons to aspiration

I had nightmares though
with little reasons to move

Toward the start informally given my reasons

There are spots waiting
More reasons around my country 

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
and could be inflected with reasons

careening between the preambles
