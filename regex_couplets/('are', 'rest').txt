('are', 'rest')

Though there are quarters goals
wrestling to stay still

there are quarters 
We can wrestle them with their goals

though there are quarters with goals
that agreed one of rest

Though we are waiting for her
Aligned or not with my interests

That are my right to say
 as points which are my interest 

in welfare and hope
My interesting politics

careening between the preambles
