('are', 'resume')

Though there are quarters goals
and can’t presume to need

who are so fresh and agile
Then I can’t presume to need others

barely outlines
I resume unassimilable visions

but they are black spots
I resume indelible tracks

There are spots waiting
I presume to others

Though we are waiting for her
So I presume the offers already

careening between the preambles
I presume the offers
