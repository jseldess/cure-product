('are', 'retrieve')

Though there are quarters goals
I send and retrieve the impulse

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

Though we are breaking 
I stand and retrieve the impulse

Though we are waiting 
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

Though we are waiting for her
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

There are constant ways
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

There are no constant ways
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

That are my right to say
