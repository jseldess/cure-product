('are', 'say')

Though there are quarters goals
we had to say goodbye

There are spots waiting
I ask say in that case

Though we are waiting for her
we ask say in that case

There are constant ways
formerly along my say to the elections

That are my right to say
I ask say in that phase decisioned

careening between the preambles
