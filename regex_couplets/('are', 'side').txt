('are', 'side')

Though there are quarters goals
aside from the retinas

I had nightmares though
actually considering the end

There are spots waiting
But my not feeling the memory aside

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

Though we are breaking 
where I send and relive aside

Though we are waiting 
by the side of the hosting service

still carefully
But my not feeling the memory inside

Though we are waiting for her
By my feeling the memory inside

There are constant ways
44 seconds inside

That are my right to say
