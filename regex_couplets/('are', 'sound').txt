('are', 'sound')

Though there are quarters goals
sound inundated for my own purchases

Though we are breaking 
and sound redundant

Though we are waiting 
by in the sound privacy

though we are waiting for her
by in the sounded privacy

That are my right to say
buy in the sound privacy

careening between the preambles
