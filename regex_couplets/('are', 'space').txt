('are', 'space')

Though there are quarters goals
in rotating directionless space

there are quarters 
into rotating and directionless space

though there are quarters with goals
and then into rotating and directional space

who are so fresh and agile
in the space that it had

Though we are waiting for her
though we are breaking in the space that it had

Though we are breaking 
in the fill space 

careening between the preambles
