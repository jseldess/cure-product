('are', 'speak')

Though there are quarters goals
not speaking

Though we are waiting for her
without really speaking

though we are breaking in the space that it had
I speak to them

Though we are waiting 
I speak to them my possessions

still carefully
I speak them of my possessions

There are constant ways
speak them of my possessions

That are my right to say
