('are', 'stand')

Though there are quarters goals
hovering above standing water

barely outlines
I stand and retrieve the impulse

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
where I stand and relive

Though we are breaking 
I stand and retrieve the impuse

Though we are waiting 
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

Though we are waiting for her
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

There are constant ways
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

There are no constant ways
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

That are my right to say
I learned the point of standing

careening between the preambles
