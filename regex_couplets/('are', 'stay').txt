('are', 'stay')

Though there are quarters goals
wrestling to stay still

there are quarters 
So stay with us

The days are long
own stays brought loyal

Though we are waiting for her
own that stays brought loyal

There are constant ways
that stays brought loyal

That are my right to say
I stay the right of my elections

careening between the preambles
