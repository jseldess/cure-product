('are', 'step')

Though there are quarters goals
I step off the edge

there are quarters 
I step over the edge

though there are quarters with goals
If I step on the edge

who are so fresh and agile
What the next step

They are called aspirational
from which to step off

The days are long
step in by the prospect

though we are waiting for her
phase decision step in

That are my right to say
step by into the prospect

careening between the preambles
stepping in the middle
