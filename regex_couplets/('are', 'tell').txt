('are', 'tell')

Though there are quarters goals
Then I constellate my time family country

who are so fresh and agile
So I constellate the time family country

barely outlines
I had to tell them the news

The days are long
I tell you my purposes

There are spots waiting
I tell you the weight of my purchases

Though we are waiting for her
and that man comes on to tell me 

still carefully
