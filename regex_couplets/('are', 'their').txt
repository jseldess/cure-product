('are', 'their')

Though there are quarters goals
We can wrestle them with their goals

there are quarters 
We can rest there in them with their goals

though there are quarters with goals
I am not allowed to see their face

They are called aspirational
that their economic value 

The days are long
without their agreement

Though we are waiting for her
to their other end

The many transparent pixel calls
who know the way to their other end

The many transparent pixels call
that their knowing

careening between the preambles
