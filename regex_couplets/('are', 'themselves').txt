('are', 'themselves')

Though there are quarters goals
talking into pheasants bending themselves

but they are black spots
talking into percents bending themselves

There are spots waiting
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

Though we are waiting 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

 still carefully
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

That are my right to say
