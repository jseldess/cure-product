('are', 'time.')

Though there are quarters goals
where I sleep at times

who are so fresh and agile
over the long time up in the sky

There are quarterly goals
at any time it can drift again

barely outlines
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

They are called aspirational
The long time I had a vision

but they are black spots
without the long time I was accounting

I believe I can prepare for it
So I constellate the time family country

There are spots waiting
or alter of course the time anyway

Though we are waiting for her
formerly a long time they were on

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
until a happier time found

Though we are waiting 
formerly along time they were on

There are constant ways
time they were on

That are my right to say
in the long time they were on

careening between the preambles
