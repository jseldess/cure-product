('are', 'tire')

Though there are quarters goals
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The days are long
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

I had nightmares though
until I could not tire 

There are spots waiting
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

Though we are waiting for her
