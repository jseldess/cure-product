('are', 'turn')

Though there are quarters goals
in a sharp downward turn 

who are so fresh and agile
sudden downward turn

barely outlines
who knows how to turn it off

Though we are waiting for her
Bach helps turn it off

There are constant ways
I turn not sad exactly

That are my right to say
I return not sad exactly

careening between the preambles
