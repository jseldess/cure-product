('are', 'up?')

Though there are quarters goals
Theyâ€™re just not mine

there are quarters 
Though how can you know without direction

though there are quarters with goals
for how can you know without direction

who are so fresh and agile
Puffs of air

There are quarterly goals
And as an extension of the values

barely outlines
Then I cannot see face value

They are called aspirational
your bid to the next highest ranked network

The days are long
I argued that the days were longer

I had nightmares though
I am full of potential

but they are black spots
black spots on a white surface

I believe I can prepare for it
White spots on a black surface

There are spots waiting
until I purchase up in the sky

Though we are waiting for her
I thought

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
elsewhere my purposes

though we are still breaking in
I though

though we are breaking in the space that it had
where I send and relive would be held

Though we are breaking 
and literally unproved

Though we are waiting 
all parties would be held

still carefully
answered about

There are constant ways
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

The many transparent pixel calls
But my not feeling the memory inside

There are no constant waves
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

There are no constant ways
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

Formerly away there are constant ways
I end up Bach

That are my right to say
about 

 as points which are my interest 
iced coffee and sun position

careening between the preambles
I presume the offers
