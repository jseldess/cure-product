('are', 'us')

Though there are quarters goals
Theyâ€™re just not mine

there are quarters 
slow asynchronous

who are so fresh and agile
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

barely outlines
The ventillation rushes on

They are called aspirational
So stay with us

The days are long
but it continued rippling muscle

but they are black spots
I reuse indelible tracks

I believe I can prepare for it
I refuse indelible tracts

There are spots waiting
a futile joyous white sun

Though we are waiting for her
in the form filled offered in trust

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

Though we are breaking
useless for not having paid

Though we are waiting 
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

still carefully
in the form filled offered trust

There are constant ways
radiating from housing

That are my right to say
I have them trust in me

careening between the preambles
