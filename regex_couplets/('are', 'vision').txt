('are', 'vision')

Though there are quarters goals
I had me a vision

barely outlines
The planning process for visions

They are called aspirational
The planning process is for visionaries only

The days are long
aspirating with visions

I had nightmares though
embodied with little visions

but they are black spots
I resume unassimilable visions

I believe I can prepare for it
The long time I had a vision

There are spots waiting
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

Though we are waiting for her
there wasnâ€™t any television 

still carefully
joined in my television

That are my right to say
visions that can be attainable

careening between the preambles
revisions that can be attributable
