('are', 'visions')

Though there are quarters goals
The planning process for visions

They are called aspirational
aspirating visions

The days are long
aspirating with visions

I had nightmares though
embodied with little visions

but they are black spots
I resume unassimilable visions

I believe I can prepare for it
I resume attributable visions

There are spots waiting
visions that can be attainable

careening between the preambles
revisions that can be attributable
