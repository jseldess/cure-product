('are', 'ways')

Though there are quarters goals
always watching

There are spots waiting
deep into pathways from repeated travels

Though we are waiting 
with constant ways 

Though we are waiting for her
with her ways to the ends

There are constant ways
Formerly away there are constant ways

The many transparent pixel calls
There are no constant ways

That are my right to say
