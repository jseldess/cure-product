('are', 'world')

Though there are quarters goals
off the edge of the world

There are quarterly goals
Which can be pronounced to the world

barely outlines
off the end of the world

The days are long
hauling off the end of the world

but they are black spots
falling off the end of the world

I believe I can prepare for it
the opinions in my world

Though we are waiting
