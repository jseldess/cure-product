('around', 'IN')

Spinning around the heart
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

around my country 
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
By NATASHA SINGER

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
