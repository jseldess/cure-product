('around', 'My')

Spinning around the heart
My associations

around my country 
My purpose up in the sky

articles all around us
My means without gravity

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
My daughter with her way

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
My daughter helps too

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
My say to the elections
