('around', 'so')

Spinning around the heart
Even before the lesson starts

around my country 
If I take some different measure

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

around the dogs and lillies
so that nothing had gravity

More reasons around my country 
sound inundated for my own purchases

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
firing and connecting somewhere

and around redundant
for not paying sound overwhelmed

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
by in the sound privacy
