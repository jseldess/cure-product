('around', 'There')

Spinning around the heart
There was very little physical activity

around my country 
There are spots waiting

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

More reasons around my country 
There are constant ways

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
There are no constant waves

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
There are no constant ways

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
