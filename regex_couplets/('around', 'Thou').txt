('around', 'Thou')

Spinning around the heart
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

around my country 
Though we are waiting for her

More reasons around my country 
Though we are breaking 

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
Though we are waiting 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
Though we can’t help waiting

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
