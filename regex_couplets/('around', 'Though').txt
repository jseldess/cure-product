('around', 'though')

Spinning around the heart
I had nightmares though

around my country 
I thought

More reasons around my country 
though we are still breaking in

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
after though thereâ€™s no memory

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
I answered what I thought
