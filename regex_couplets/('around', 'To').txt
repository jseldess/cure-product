('around', 'To')

Spinning around the heart
To that impossible place

around my country 
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

More reasons around my country 
To the ends of transactions

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
To the ends of my transactions

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
To the other end of transactions

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
To the other end of my actions

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
To the right of determined elections
