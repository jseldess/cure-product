('around', 'under')

Spinning around the heart
under pillowing a cloud

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
she lay under the grass

articles all around us
under the grasp principle

articles all around storming around
under the past principle

Articles all around stores in surfeit
designed to hold up my underwear

around the dogs and lillies
