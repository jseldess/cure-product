('around', 'Where')

Spinning around the heart
Where I put it beating

around my country 
Where I lead gravity

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Where I need gravity

More reasons around my country 
Where I host my purposes

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
Where in me did I host

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
