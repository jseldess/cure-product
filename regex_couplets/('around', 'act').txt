('around', 'act')

Spinning around the heart
I was enjoined to act again

around my country 
we had inhabited actually

More reasons around my country 
The ends of my transactions

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
to the ends of my transactions

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
Itâ€™s not marshal exactly

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
the other end transactions

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
of my actions
