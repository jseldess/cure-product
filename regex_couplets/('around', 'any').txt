('around', 'any')

Spinning around the heart
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

around my country 
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Articles all around us
there wasn’t any television 

around the dogs and lillies
without any further damage

More reasons around my country 
They have very many choices

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
latency which doesn’t mean anything

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
The many transparent pixel calls

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
or imagined anyway
