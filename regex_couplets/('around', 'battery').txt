('around', 'battery')

Spinning around the heart
battery dawn nights blending themselves

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
battery dawn nights 

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
battery dawn 

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
battery dawn nights ending themselves
