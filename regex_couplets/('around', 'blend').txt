('around', 'blend')

Spinning around the heart
walking into percents blending themselves

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
where I blend and relive

and around redundant
battery dawn nights blending themselves

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
where lights blended themselves

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
dawn formerly rights blended themselves
