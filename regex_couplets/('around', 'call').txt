('around', 'call')

Spinning around the heart
They are called aspirational

around my country 
Which can be called confidence

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
though it was most emphatically that

More reasons around my country 
to take the call

and around redundant
The many transparent pixel calls

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
recalling aside
