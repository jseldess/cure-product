('around', 'continue')

Spinning around the heart
but it continued

around my country 
I continue to presume

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I continue to consume

Articles all around us
Then I continue to dream then

around the dogs and lillies
I continued to dream then

More reasons around my country
