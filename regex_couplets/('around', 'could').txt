('around', 'could')

Spinning around the heart
and could be mapped and weighed

around my country 
until I could not be tired

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I could consume the dream

Articles all around us
I could in effect credit

around the dogs and lillies
and we could inhabit the room easy

More reasons around my country 
and could be inflected with reasons
