('around', 'daughter')

Spinning around the heart
I love my daughter still

around my country 
with my daughter

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
My daughter helps too

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
my daughter will learn 

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me
