('around', 'dawn')

Spinning around the heart
Forecasting the story before dawn

around my country 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
dawn already formerly nights 

More reasons around my country 
dawn formerly

and around redundant
with dawn already formerly nights 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
battery dawn nights 

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
battery dawn 

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
dawn formerly rights ended themselves
