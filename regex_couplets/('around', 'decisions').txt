('around', 'decisions')

Spinning around the heart
the planning process for decisions

around my country 
attributable decisions

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
forgetting decisions 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
that decisions can be attributable

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
decisions that can be attributable
