('around', 'do')

Spinning around the heart
the dogs and lillies

around my country 
What I do in my liesure

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
around the dogs and lillies

I spin around
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

More reasons around my country 
and it doesn’t take long

and around redundant
latency which doesn’t mean anything

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
I only think I don’t listen
