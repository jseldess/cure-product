('around', 'eat')

Spinning around the heart
Where I put it beating

around my country 
And from that great distance

around the dogs and lillies
And from a great distance

I spin around 
was not just a defeat

More reasons around my country 
for the creation of the universe

and around redundant
burrowed about from repeated travels
