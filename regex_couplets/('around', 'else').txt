('around', 'else')

Spinning around the heart
If you have confidence regardless all else

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

around the dogs and lillies
and elsewhere my memory

More reasons around my country 
and elsewhere my memory of you

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
elsewhere by my memory

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
By my memory elsewhere
