('around', 'enter')

Spinning around the heart
The sun high enough to enter directly 

around my country 
I enter the flattening mirror

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I have entered my purposes

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
I have entered my phone

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
I had entered my phone
