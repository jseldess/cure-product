('around', 'form')

Spinning around the heart
Toward the start informally given my reasons

around my country 
already formerly a long time

More reasons around my country 
A way formerly like this one

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
dawn formerly

and around redundant
in the form filled offered in trust

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
formerly a way

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
formerly a way like this one

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
formerly away
