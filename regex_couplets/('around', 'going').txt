('around', 'going')

Spinning around the heart
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

around my country 
The way that she is going

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
The way that I am going

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
The way that I was going

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
way I was going 

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
