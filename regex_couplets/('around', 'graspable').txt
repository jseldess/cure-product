('around', 'graspable')

Spinning around the heart
having been graspable

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
having been an ungraspable time

Articles all around us
for an ungraspable purchase

articles all around storming around
For an ungraspable time

around the dogs and lillies
And for an ungraspable time

I spin around
