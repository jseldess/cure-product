('around', 'have')

Spinning around the heart
If you have confidence regardless all else

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I have supporters

around the dogs and lillies
I have a memory between the day

More reasons around my country 
I have entered my purposes

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
I have turned it off

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
and have no way
