('around', 'he')

Spinning around the heart
Where I put it beating

around my country 
but where is it

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

Articles all around us
Under the last principle of purchasing power

articles all around storming around
under the grasp principle

Articles all around stores in surfeit
We had to say goodbye there

around the dogs and lillies
Then I continue to dream then

I spin around
where I need gravity

around 
I designed them to hold up my underwear

I spun around trying to touch the spots
There are spots waiting

More reasons around my country 
and elsewhere my memory of you

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
where I send and relive

and around redundant
knowing the constituents

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
But my not feeling the memory inside

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
Selma helps too

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
the other end transactions
