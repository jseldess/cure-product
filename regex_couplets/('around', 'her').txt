('around', 'her')

Spinning around the heart
Where I put it beating

around my country 
but where is it

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

Articles all around us
And we had to say goodbye to her there

articles all around storming around
We had to say goodbye there

around the dogs and lillies
Where I lead gravity

I spin around
where I need gravity

around 
There are spots waiting

More reasons around my country 
and elsewhere my memory of you

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
where I send and relive

and around redundant
Where in me did I host

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
Though we are waiting for her

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
with her way to the ends

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
the other end transactions
