('around', 'if')

Spinning around the heart
out of the fifth page ruins

around my country 
If I take a different measure

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
if there is anything 

More reasons around my country 
if you have providence

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
if that has anything

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
if only on the way to the trash
