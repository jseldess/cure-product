('around', 'last')

Spinning around the heart
What was the last time

around my country 
under the last seen principle

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Under the last principle 

Articles all around us
Under the last principle of purchasing power

articles all around storming around
Where in me did I last

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
last night

and around redundant
