('around', 'live')

Spinning around the heart
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

around my country 
Which is a pleasure to never live out

More reasons around my country 
where I send and relive aside

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
where I send and relive

and around redundant
where I stand and relive
