('around', 'man')

Spinning around the heart
not many face up

around my country 
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
They have very many choices

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
and that man comes on to tell me 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
The many transparent pixel calls

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
