('around', 'mean')

Spinning around the heart
My means without gravity

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
The other end of means

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
To the other end of means like this one

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
