('around', 'move')

Spinning around the heart
since I can imagine movement

around my country 
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
and literally moved

More reasons around my country 
myself moved literally as it is

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
not literally moved about

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
also didnâ€™t really move
