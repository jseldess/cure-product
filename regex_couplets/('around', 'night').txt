('around', 'night')

Spinning around the heart
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

around my country 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
dawn already formerly nights 

More reasons around my country 
last night

and around redundant
with dawn already formerly nights 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
battery dawn nights 

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
nights

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
battery dawn nights ending themselves
