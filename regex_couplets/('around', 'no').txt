('around', 'no')

Spinning around the heart
Then I cannot see face value

around my country 
until I could not be tired

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I used my technology

around the dogs and lillies
that nothing had gravity

More reasons around my country 
which we can pronounce

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
But my not feeling the memory inside

and around redundant
knowing the constituents

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
It’s not marshal exactly

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
It’s not marshall exactly

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
with no way
