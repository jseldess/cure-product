('around', 'now')

Spinning around the heart
Right now I’m the cart

around my country 
even when close to my knowing

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
knowing the constituents

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
who knows the way

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
who know the ways to their other end

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
that their knowing
