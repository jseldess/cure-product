('around', 'only')

Spinning around the heart
So that I notice I am the only one

around my country 
only in the case

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
would only willingly break

and around redundant
would only willingly speak

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
if only on the way to the trash
