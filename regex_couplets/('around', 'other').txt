('around', 'other')

Spinning around the heart
Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type

around my country 
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
and other types of tracking technology

More reasons around my country 
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
I presume to others

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
to the other end

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
the other end transactions

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
The other end of means
