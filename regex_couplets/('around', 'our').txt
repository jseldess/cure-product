('around', 'our')

Spinning around the heart
or an available resource

around my country 
or alter of course the time anyway

More reasons around my country 
This is your chance

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
Who throws contours away

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
who throws contours a way

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
phrase them of our possessions
