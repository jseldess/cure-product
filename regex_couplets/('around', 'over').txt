('around', 'over')

Spinning around the heart
hovering above standing water

around my country 
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

More reasons around my country

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
for not paying sound overwhelmed

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
