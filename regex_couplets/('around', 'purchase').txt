('around', 'purchase')

Spinning around the heart
in traversing my purchase

around my country 
purchased out

Articles all around us
Having been purchased out of you

articles all around storming around
And need out in front purchase

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I tell you the weight of my purchases

around the dogs and lillies
until I purchase up the sky

I spin around
until I purchase the sky

I spun around trying to touch the spots
until I purchase up in the sky

More reasons around my country 
I have entered my purchases

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
for my own purchases

and around redundant
converting sight into a purchase

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
impulse for my own purchases
