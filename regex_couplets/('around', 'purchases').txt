('around', 'purchases')

Spinning around the heart
I tell you the weight of my purchases

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Is the weight of my purchases

More reasons around my country 
I have entered my purchases

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
for my own purchases

and around redundant
impulse for my own purchases
