('around', 'purpose')

Spinning around the heart
by no ventillation my purpose

around my country 
until I purpose the horizon

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
My purpose up in the sky

articles all around us
Until my purpose 

around the dogs and lillies
I tell you my purposes

I spin around
I tell you the weight of my purposes

More reasons around my country 
I have entered my purposes

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
the impulse for my own purposes

and around redundant
to the other end of my purpose

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
the impulse to my purpose
