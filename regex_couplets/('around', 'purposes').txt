('around', 'purposes')

Spinning around the heart
I tell you my purposes

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I tell you the weight of my purposes

More reasons around my country 
I have entered my purposes

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
the impulse for my own purposes

and around redundant
for my own purposes
