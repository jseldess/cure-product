('around', 'really')

Spinning around the heart
When they really take hold of my finger

around my country 
without really agreeing

More reasons around my country 
without really speaking

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
without really branding 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
also didnâ€™t really move
