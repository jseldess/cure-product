('around', 'ring')

Spinning around the heart
hovering above standing water

around my country 
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
storing in surfeit

articles all around us
firing and connecting somewhere

and around redundant
The prospect for veering healthily
