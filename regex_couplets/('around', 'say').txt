('around', 'say')

Spinning around the heart
we had to say goodbye

articles all around us
We had to say goodbye there

articles all around storming around
And we had to say goodbye to her there

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I ask say in that case

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
formerly along my say to the elections

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
My say to the elections
