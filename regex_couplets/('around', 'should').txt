('around', 'should')

Spinning around the heart
While I should be sleeping 

around my country 
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
One was up where it should be down

More reasons around my country 
they should rise up

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
