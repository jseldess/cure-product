('around', 'site')

Spinning around the heart
here is the site of the battle of maldon

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
about the site

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
at the site of a purchase
