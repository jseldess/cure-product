('around', 'tell')

Spinning around the heart
I had to tell them the news

around my country 
I tell you my purposes

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I tell you the weight of my purchases

More reasons around my country 
and that man comes on to tell me 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
