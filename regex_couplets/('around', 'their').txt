('around', 'their')

Spinning around the heart
I am not allowed to see their face

around my country 
without their agreement

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
to their other end

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
who know the ways to their other end

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
that their knowing
