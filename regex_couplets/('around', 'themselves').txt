('around', 'themselves')

Spinning around the heart
talking into pheasants bending themselves

around my country 
talking into percents bending themselves

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

and around redundant
battery dawn nights blending themselves

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
battery dawn nights ending themselves
