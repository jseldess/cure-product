('around', 'time.')

Spinning around the heart
On the timeline I was on

around my country 
The long time I had a vision

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
or alter of course the time anyway

More reasons around my country

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
until a happier time found

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
formerly along time they were on
