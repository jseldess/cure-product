('around', 'turn')

Spinning around the heart
I keep turning back

around my country 
who knows how to turn it off

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
Bach helps turn it off

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
My daughter turns it off too

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
I turn not sad exactly
