('around', 'until')

Spinning around the heart
until my purpose up in the sky

around my country 
until I could not be tired

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
until I purpose up in the sky

around the dogs and lillies
until I purchase up the sky

I spin around
until I purchase the sky

I spun around trying to touch the spots
until I purchase up in the sky

More reasons around my country 
until a happier time found

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
