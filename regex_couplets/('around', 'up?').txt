('around', 'up?')

Spinning around the heart
Where I put it beating

around my country 
but where is it

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

Articles all around us
Having been purchased out of you

articles all around storming around
Articles all around stores in surfeit

around the dogs and lillies
I spin around

around 
I captured an afterimage

I spun around trying to touch the spots
until I purchase up in the sky

More reasons around my country 
I have entered my purposes

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
for my own purchases

and around redundant
would only willingly speak

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
But my not feeling the memory inside

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
I end up Bach
