('around', 'us')

Spinning around the heart
You use the most essential parts

around my country 
I have them trust in me

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Articles all around us

articles all around storming around
I wear suspenders

around the dogs and lillies
I used my technology

I spin around
suspenders

around 
a futile joyous white sun

More reasons around my country 
trackers collecting data on users

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
useless for not having paid

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
radiating from housing
