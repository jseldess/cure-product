('around', 'use')

Spinning around the heart
You use the most essential parts

around my country 
I used my technology

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
trackers collecting data on users

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
useless for not having paid

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
