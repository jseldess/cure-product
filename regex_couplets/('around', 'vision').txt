('around', 'vision')

Spinning around the heart
I had me a vision

around my country 
The long time I had a vision

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
there wasnâ€™t any television 

around the dogs and lillies
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

More reasons around my country 
joined in my television
