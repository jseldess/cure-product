('around', 'wait')

Spinning around the heart
There are spots waiting

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Though we are waiting for her

More reasons around my country 
not needing to wait

and around redundant
Though we are waiting 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
waiting out front or up above
