('around', 'watch')

Spinning around the heart
when watching tv

around my country 
in the sense of watching

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I watch a movie

Articles all around us
I watch a moving afterimage

around the dogs and lillies
When I'm watching my tv 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
where Iâ€™m watching my tv
