('around', 'ways')

Spinning around the heart
always watching

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
deep into pathways from repeated travels

and around redundant
with constant ways 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
with her ways to the ends

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
There are constant ways

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
