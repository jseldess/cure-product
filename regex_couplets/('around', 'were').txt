('around', 'were')

Spinning around the heart
I wish my desires were open

around my country 
they were on

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

More reasons around my country 
answered about 

and around redundant
formerly a long time they were on

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
I answered what I thought

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
I answered about
