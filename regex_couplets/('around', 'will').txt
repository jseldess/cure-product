('around', 'will')

Spinning around the heart
will not be the same

around my country 
that will spur me on

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
would only willingly break

and around redundant
would only willingly speak

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
my daughter will learn 

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
