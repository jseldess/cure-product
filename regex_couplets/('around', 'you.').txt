('around', 'you.')

Spinning around the heart
That you can see only the back of

around my country 
If you have confidence regardless all else

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I tell you my purposes

around the dogs and lillies
I tell you the weight of my purchases

More reasons around my country 
This is your chance

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
the young ripples inaudibly
