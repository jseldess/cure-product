('aside', 'so')

aside from the retinas
my associations

But my not feeling the memory aside
sound inundated for my own purchases

where I send and relive aside
and sound redundant

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
firing and connecting somewhere

where I am aside
for not paying sound overwhelmed

where I send and retrieve aside
also didnâ€™t really move
