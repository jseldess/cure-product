('aside', 'Thou')

aside from the retinas
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

But my not feeling the memory aside
Though we are waiting for her

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
Though we are breaking 

where I send and relive aside
Though we are waiting 

where I send and retrieve aside
