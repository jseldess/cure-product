('aside', 'Where')

aside from the retinas
Where I take my liesure

But my not feeling the memory aside
Where I host my purposes

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
Where in me did I last

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
Where I send and relive aside

where I send and retrieve aside
Where in me did I host

where I stand aside
