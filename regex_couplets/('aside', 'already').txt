('aside', 'already')

aside from the retinas
already formerly a long time

But my not feeling the memory aside
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
already formely a long time

where I send and relive aside
with dawn already formerly nights 

where I send and retrieve aside
So I presume the offers already
