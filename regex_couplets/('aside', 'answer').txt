('aside', 'answer')

aside from the retinas
for the duration of the answer

But my not feeling the memory aside
answered about 

where I am aside
the duration of answers

where I send and relive aside
for the duration of answers

But my feeling the memory aside
at least for the duration of the answer

where I am aside at least
I answered about
