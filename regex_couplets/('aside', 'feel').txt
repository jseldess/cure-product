('aside', 'feel')

aside from the retinas
What would I feel without that goal

But my not feeling the memory aside
But my not feeling the memory inside

where I send and relive aside
which feels most comfortable

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
But my feeling the memory aside

where I am aside increased
which I feel formerly about for
