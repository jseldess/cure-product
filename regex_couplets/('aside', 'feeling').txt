('aside', 'feeling')

aside from the retinas
But my not feeling the memory aside

where I send and relive aside
But my not feeling the memory inside

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
By my feeling the memory inside

where I send and retrieve aside
But my feeling the memory aside

where I am aside increased
