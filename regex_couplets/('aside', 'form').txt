('aside', 'form')

aside from the retinas
Toward the start informally given my reasons

But my not feeling the memory aside
A way formerly like this one

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
already formely a long time

where I send and relive aside
in the form filled offered in trust

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
already formerly a long time

where I send and retrieve aside
dawn formerly

where I am aside at least
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

where I am aside
with dawn already formerly nights 

where I stand aside
which I feel formerly about for
