('aside', 'found')

aside from the retinas
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
and found inundated

where I send and relive aside
and found redundant

But my not feeling the memory aside
and latency found

where I send and retrieve aside
So I found myself at home
