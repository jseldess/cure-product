('aside', 'he')

aside from the retinas
I argued that the days were longer

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

where I send and relive aside
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

where I send and retrieve aside
the impulse for my own purposes

where I stand aside
the impulse to my purpose

aside the impulse to my purpose
where I stand aside and retrieve

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
I stand and retrieve the impuse

where I am aside at least
for the duration of the answer

where I am aside
the duration of answers

But my feeling the memory aside
firing and connecting somewhere

where I am aside increased
where I am decided least

recalling aside
By my memory elsewhere
