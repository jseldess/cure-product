('aside', 'impulse')

aside from the retinas
I send and retrieve the impulse

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

where I send and relive aside
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

where I send and retrieve aside
the impulse for my own purposes

where I stand aside
the impulse to my purpose

aside the impulse to my purpose
the impulse my own prospects

where I stand aside and retrieve
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

where I am aside at least
