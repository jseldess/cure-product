('aside', 'literal')

aside from the retinas
and literally moved

But my not feeling the memory aside
as it was designed literally

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
and literally unproved

where I send and relive aside
literally unproved 

where I send and retrieve aside
myself moved literally as it is

where I stand aside
not literally moved about
