('aside', 'live')

aside from the retinas
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

But my not feeling the memory aside
where I send and relive aside

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
where I stand and relive

where I send and retrieve aside
where I stand and retrieve relive

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
where I send and relive

where I stand aside
where I send and retrieve relive

where I am aside
where I end and relive

aside the impulse to my purpose
and relive from burrowed travels

But my feeling the memory aside
