('aside', 'most')

aside from the retinas
I invited most of what came next

But my not feeling the memory aside
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
which feels most comfortable

where I send and relive aside
mostly along cables

where I am aside
at least most days

where I am aside at least
