('aside', 'no')

aside from the retinas
there was no promotion

But my not feeling the memory aside
and other types of tracking technology

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
But my not feeling the memory inside

where I send and relive aside
from no one point

where I am aside at least
not needing to wait

where I am aside
knowing the constituents

where I send and retrieve aside
But my not 

recalling aside
Aligned or not with my interests
