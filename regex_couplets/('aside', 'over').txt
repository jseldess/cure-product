('aside', 'over')

aside from the retinas
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

But my not feeling the memory aside
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
for not paying sound overwhelmed

where I send and relive aside
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
