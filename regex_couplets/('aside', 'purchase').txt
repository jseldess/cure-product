('aside', 'purchase')

aside from the retinas
in traversing my purchase

But my not feeling the memory aside
the impulse for my own purchases

where I stand aside
I have entered my purchases

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
sound inundated for my own purchases

where I send and relive aside
For my own purchases

where I send and retrieve aside
impulse for my own purchases

aside the impulse to my purpose
converting sight into a purchase

where I stand aside and retrieve
at the site of a purchase
