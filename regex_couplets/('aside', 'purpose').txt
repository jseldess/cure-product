('aside', 'purpose')

aside from the retinas
until I purpose the horizon

But my not feeling the memory aside
the impulse for my own purposes

where I stand aside
the impulse to my purpose

aside the impulse to my purpose
Where I host my purposes

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
to the other end of my purpose

where I send and relive aside
for my own purposes
