('aside', 'retrieve')

aside from the retinas
I send and retrieve the impulse

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

where I send and relive aside
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

where I send and retrieve aside
where I stand and retrieve

aside the impulse to my purpose
where I stand aside and retrieve

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
I stand and retrieve the impuse

where I stand aside
where I stand and retrieve relive

where I am aside at least
where I send and retrieve relive

where I am aside
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

But my feeling the memory aside
