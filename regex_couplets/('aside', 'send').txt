('aside', 'send')

aside from the retinas
I send and retrieve the impulse

But my not feeling the memory aside
where I send and relive aside

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
where I send and retrieve aside

where I stand aside
where I send and relive would be held

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
where I send and relive

aside the impulse to my purpose
where I send and retrieve relive

where I am aside
where I send and receive

where I stand aside and retrieve
