('aside', 'side')

aside from the retinas
actually considering the end

But my not feeling the memory aside
where I send and relive aside

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
where I send and retrieve aside

where I stand aside
aside the impulse to my purpose

where I stand aside and retrieve
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

where I am aside at least
where I am aside

But my feeling the memory aside
where I am aside increased

recalling aside
