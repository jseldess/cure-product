('aside', 'site')

aside from the retinas
here is the site of the battle of maldon

But my not feeling the memory aside
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
about the site

where I send and relive aside
at the site of a purchase
