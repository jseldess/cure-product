('aside', 'time.')

aside from the retinas
The long time I had a vision

But my not feeling the memory aside
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
until a happier time found

where I send and relive aside
in the long time they were on
