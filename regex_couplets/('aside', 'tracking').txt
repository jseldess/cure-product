('aside', 'tracking')

aside from the retinas
and other types of tracking technology

But my not feeling the memory aside
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
sizes asking for tracking sound

where I send and relive aside
