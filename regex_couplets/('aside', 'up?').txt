('aside', 'up?')

aside from the retinas
I argued that the days were longer

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

where I send and relive aside
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

where I send and retrieve aside
the impulse for my own purposes

where I stand aside
the impulse to my purpose

aside the impulse to my purpose
Where I host my purposes

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
I stand and retrieve the impuse

where I stand aside and retrieve
between the drug store and the 

where I am aside at least
for the duration of the answer

where I am aside
the duration of answers

But my feeling the memory aside
the least productive of myself

recalling aside
Selmaâ€™s squirrel and chickadee
