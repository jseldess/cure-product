('aside', 'us')

aside from the retinas
So stay with us

But my not feeling the memory aside
trackers collecting data on users

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
in the form filled offered in trust

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
I stand and retrieve the impuse

where I send and relive aside
useless for not having paid

where I send and retrieve aside
radiating from housing
