('ask', 'To')

You should ask who I am
To my children Walt Whitman

drifting away from the task
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

to ask in advance
To neither study

I ask say in that case
To the ends of transactions

we ask say in that case
To the ends of my transactions

I ask say in that phase decisioned
To the right of determined elections

sizes track for asking sound
