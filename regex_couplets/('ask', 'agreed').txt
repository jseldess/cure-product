('ask', 'agreed')

You should ask who I am
and to which I’ve agreed

to ask in advance
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

I ask say in that case
and to which the plan agreed

we ask say in that case
that agreed one of rest

I ask say in that phase decisioned
that agreed home

sizes track for asking sound
