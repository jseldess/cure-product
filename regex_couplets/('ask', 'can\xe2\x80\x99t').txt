('ask', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

You should ask who I am
I can’t fix them without direction

drifting away from the task
But I can’t let myself treat 

to ask in advance
Though we can’t help waiting

I ask say in that case
I can’t remember them

We ask say in that case
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
