('ask', 'going')

You should ask who I am
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

drifting away from the task
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

to ask in advance
The way that she is going

I ask say in that case
The way that I am going

we ask say in that case
