('ask', 'learn')

You should ask who I am
in light of learning what we see

drifting away from the task
I spend time online learning to code

to ask in advance
decisioned to learn 

I ask say in that case
decisioned to learn back

we ask say in that case
phase decision for learning

sizes track for asking sound
for learning by the prospect

sizes asking for tracking sound
I learned my location

I ask say in that phase decisioned
a precision for learning

in track as offer asked
