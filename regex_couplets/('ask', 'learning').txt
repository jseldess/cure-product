('ask', 'learning')

You should ask who I am
in light of learning what we see

drifting away from the task
I spend time online learning to code

to ask in advance
phase decision for learning

sizes track for asking sound
for learning by the prospect

sizes asking for tracking sound
a precision for learning

we ask say in that case
