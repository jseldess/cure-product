('ask', 'our')

You should ask who I am
reasons resources

drifting away from the task
You can hear it also through your leisure

to ask in advance
Or alter of course the time anyway

I ask say in that case
Who throws contours away

we ask say in that case
phrase them of our possessions

I ask say in that phase decisioned
