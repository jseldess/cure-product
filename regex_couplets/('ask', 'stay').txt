('ask', 'stay')

You should ask who I am
wrestling to stay still

drifting away from the task
So stay with us

to ask in advance
own stays brought loyal

I ask say in that case
own that stays brought loyal

we ask say in that case
that stays brought loyal

I ask say in that phase decisioned
I stay the right of my elections

sizes track for asking sound
