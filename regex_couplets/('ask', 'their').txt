('ask', 'their')

You should ask who I am
We can wrestle them with their goals

drifting away from the task
I am not allowed to see their face

to ask in advance
without their agreement

I ask say in that case
to their other end

we ask say in that case
that their knowing

I ask say in that phase decisioned
