('ask', 'though')

You should ask who I am
As though stationary and a destination

drifting away from the task
though it was most emphatically that

to ask in advance
I thought

I ask say in that case
after though thereâ€™s no memory

we ask say in that case
though we are waiting for her

I ask say in that phase decisioned
I answered what I thought

sizes track for asking sound
