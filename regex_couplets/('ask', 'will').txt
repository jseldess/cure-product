('ask', 'will')

You should ask who I am
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

drifting away from the task
will not be the same

to ask in advance
would only willingly break

I ask say in that case
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

we ask say in that case
my daughter will learn 

sizes track for asking sound
