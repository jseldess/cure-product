('aspiration', 'up?')

They are called aspirational
your bid to the next highest ranked network

with little reasons to aspiration
And as an extension of the values

embodied aspirations
with full potential to movement

full of aspirations
full of potential

with little reason to aspiration
As an extension of the values

embodied with little aspirations
that potential is there for you
