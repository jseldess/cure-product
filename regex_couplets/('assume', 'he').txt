('assume', 'he')

I assumed it was visible
into the stream of pictures

I assumed 
formerly a long time they were on

I assumed what I draw
formerly along time they were on

I assume the offers reliable
I assume the offers revisitable

I assume the offers divisible
that they were visible

I assumed that they were divisible
stepping off into the middle

I assume possession to others
I presume to others
