('assume', 'offer')

I assumed it was visible
So I presume the offers already

I assumed 
in the form filled offered in trust

I assumed what I draw
in track as offer asked 

I assume the offers reliable
I assume the offers revisitable

I assume the offers divisible
I presume the offers

I assumed that they were divisible
Or can have seen offering possession

I assume possession to others
in school and can see offering
