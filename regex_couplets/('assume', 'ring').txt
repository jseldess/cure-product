('assume', 'ring')

I assumed it was visible
interferring 

I assumed 
firing and connecting somewhere

I assumed what I draw
The prospect for veering healthily

I assume the offers reliable
Or can have seen offering possession

I assumed that they were divisible
seen having or offering possession

I assume possession to others
in school and can see offering

I assume the offers revisitable
can have seen offering possession
