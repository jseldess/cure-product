('assume', 'top')

I assumed it was visible
stopped light with validated variegated fields

I assumed 
stopping into the prospect

I assumed what I draw
stopped light with validated fields

I assume the offers reliable
stopping in the middle

I assume the offers revisitable
stopping off in all directions

I assumed that they were divisible
