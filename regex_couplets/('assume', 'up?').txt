('assume', 'up?')

I assumed it was visible
into the stream of pictures

I assumed 
without really agreeing

I assumed what I draw
I presume to others

I assume the offers reliable
I assume the offers revisitable

I assume the offers divisible
and could be inflected with reasons

I assumed that they were divisible
You can have seen offering

I assume possession to others
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
