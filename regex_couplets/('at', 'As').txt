('at', 'As')

But that is beside the point
Ask who I am to suspend

Where I sleep at times
Ask who I am

into rotating directionless 
As though stationary and a destination

Rather it itself is rotating
Assimilable or

and my heart rate
Aspirational strategy

What the next step
As an extension of the values

that potential is there for you
As a clone, illegally conceived

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
