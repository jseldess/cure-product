('at', 'break')

But that is beside the point
though we are still breaking in

The way that she is going
though we are breaking in the space that it had

found dated for my own purchases
Though we are breaking 

and found inundated
without really breaking

and drowned inundated
breaking from my constituents

where I am aside at least
would only willingly break

and latently from constituents
