('at', 'Bach')

But that is beside the point
I end up in Bach 

the way was water
I end up in Bach and Selma

The way that I was going
I end up Bach

battery dawn nights 
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

to the other end battery dawn 
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

battery dawn 
I end up Bach forty-one seconds in

I answered what I thought
