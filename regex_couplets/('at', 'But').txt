Strategy comes before goals

aspirating with visions

What I do in my liesure
but they are black spots

but where is it

attesting this is a chance
attributable visions

attributable decisions
visions that can be attributable

I answered what I thought
but standing in memory

stopped light with validated fields
revisions that can be attributable

revised to be attainable
but I own all that’s messageable

The prospect for careening attached
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

in that decisions can be attributable
