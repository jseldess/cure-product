('at', 'For')

But that is beside the point
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I constellate my time family country
For whom drifting is not an exception

What Whitman
For whom 

What does it mean to drift
Forecasting the story before dawn

I am told ventillation
For an ungraspable time

 of those gathered
For Mitt Romney

though it was most emphatically that
For my own purchases

and found inundated
Formerly a way like this one

The way that I was going
Formerly away there are constant ways

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

battery dawn nights 
Forty-one seconds in

I answered what I thought
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

All that I own messageable
