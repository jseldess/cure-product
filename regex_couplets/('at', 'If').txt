('at', 'if')

But that is beside the point
drifting away

variegated reflected light
if not directly on my skin

That’s exaclty what I want for them
drifting does not feel an exception

But I can’t let myself treat 
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to treat others
at any time it can drift again

I let myself treat
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I constellate my time family country
For whom drifting is not an exception

What Whitman
What does it mean to drift

and not falling at all
drifting away needs

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
drifting away from the task

Others desires as legitimate
if you have providence to excess

the latter
if he had not carried one virtue 

was not just a defeat
out of the fifth page ruins

hovering above standing water
learned without too much difficulty to code

I am told by the ventillation
That company creates a life

aspirating with little visions
Life is with people

I aspirate with little vision
If I take a different measure

What I do in my liesure
If I take some different measure

that I can hear
if there is anything 

if that has anything
if you have providence

trackers collecting data on users
if only on the way to the trash

So I found myself at home
