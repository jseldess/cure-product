('at', 'Out')

But that is beside the point
Out of remnant pages

of later ruins
Out of the remnant ruins

and my heartrate
Out of the back page ruins

Where I put it beating
Out of the remnants 

of later pages
Out of the remnants of later pages

of later results
Out of the remnant pages

Out of the remnant pages of later ruins
Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture

dislocated and a person from a distance
Out of later results

of later pages ruins results
