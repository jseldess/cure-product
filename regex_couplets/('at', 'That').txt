('at', 'That')

But that is beside the point
That’s exaclty what I want for them

and at my desk
That is itself not still

As though stationary and a destination
That’s where I sleep at times

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
That’s when they really take

hold at intervals riding forward
That you can see only the back of

What the next step
That can’t be glimpsed

with implicit regulations
That company creates a life

aspirating with little visions
That I captured an afterimage

so that nothing had gravity
That are my right to say

my ethereal economic relations
