('at', 'There')

But that is beside the point
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
There are quarterly goals

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

So I constellate the time family country
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
There are spots waiting

And from a great distance
There are constant ways

The way that I was going
There are no constant waves

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
