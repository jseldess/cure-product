('at', 'Thou')

But that is beside the point
Though there are quarters goals

Put in place as stationary destinations
Though how can you know without direction

into rotating and directionless space
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

What I do in my liesure
Though in not many acts

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Though we are waiting for her

between that day
Though we are breaking 

and found inundated
Though we are waiting 

I designated 
Though we can’t help waiting

The way that I was going
Though we can’t help waiting for her

battery dawn nights
