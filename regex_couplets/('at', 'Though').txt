('at', 'though')

But that is beside the point
As though stationary and a destination

Rather it itself is rotating
And put in place as though stationary

in rotating directionless space
though there are quarters with goals

and then into rotating and directional space
though it was most emphatically that

I constellate the time
I had nightmares though

that I was the arm of this
though not many freeze up

explicit statements
though not many facts up in the sky

What I do in my liesure
though as for conversing

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
though in not many acts up in the sky

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
though it is not a simple act

You can clear it also through static seizure
I thought

I designated 
though we are still breaking in

The way that she is going
though we are breaking in the space that it had

found dated for my own purchases
after though thereâ€™s no memory

so still watch them
though we are waiting for her

the way was water
I answered what I thought

I assumed what I draw
I answered what I thought about

stopped light with validated fields
