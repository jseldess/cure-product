('at', 'To')

But that is beside the point
To my children Walt Whitman

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
To my chidren

What Whitman
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

So I constellate the time family country
To neither study

was not just a defeat
To that impossible place

out of later results
Tomorrow

I am told by no ventillation
Toward the start informally given my reasons

attesting this is a chance
To substitute neither study

trackers collecting data on users
To the ends of transactions

the way was water
To the ends of my transactions

the way that I was going
To the other end of transactions

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
To the other end of transactions like this

battery dawn nights 
To the right of determined elections

to return what I bought
