('at', 'under')

But that is beside the point
under pillowing a cloud

battery dawn nights blending themselves
under the last seen principle

I resume attributable visions
she lay under the grass

of those gathered
under the grasp principle

Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going
designed to hold up my underwear

that hold and wish to hold
