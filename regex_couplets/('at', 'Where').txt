('at', 'Where')

But that is beside the point
Where I sleep at times

into rotating directionless 
Whereas direction is beside the point

at home brought into privacy
Where official policy is to catch and release

and my heart rate
Where I put it beating

of later pages
Where I take my liesure

What would I feel without that goal
Where I lead gravity

And from that great distance
Where I need gravity

I watch a movie
Where in me did I host

I designated 
Where I host my purposes

was not just a defeat
Where in me did I last

and found inundated
Where in me did I lose

what literally moved
Where in me did I loose

so still watch them
Where in me pre-worn

stopped light with validated fields
Where in me did I lose trust

In what part did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

the way was water
