('at', 'while')

But that is beside the point
Looking back while I should be sleeping

at intervals while riding forward
while wrapped in static

I need an explicit statement
while wrapped in explicit static

flattening my reception
while we’re wrapped in static

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
while consuming damage

And from that great distance
I answered while interfaced

I answered what I thought
for a while to listen already

So I presume the offers at home already
for a while to listen 

I resume the offers at home
for a while not to listen

presume the offers at 
For a while I think I don’t listen

All that I own messageable
