('at', 'You')

But that is beside the point
You should ask who I am

Where I sleep at times
You can hear it also through your leisure

But I can’t let myself treat 
You use the most essential parts

That’s when they really take
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
You can clear it also through static seizure

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure

You can clear it also through static siezure
You can hear it also through static leisure

You can clear it also through static leisure
You need history

for an explicit state
You can have seen offering

in that I cannot remember
