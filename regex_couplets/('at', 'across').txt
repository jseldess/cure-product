But that is beside the point
Before we walk across the wide field

variegated reflected light
Before we walk across the wide opening

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

conversations with our reactions
Before anyone walks across the opening

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field

and at my desk
across the retinas

I argued that the days were longer
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

it was not just a defeat
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

I assumed that they were divisible
