('at', 'act')

But that is beside the point
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

stopped light with validated variegated fields
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light

and not falling at all
In the retroactive light

of retroactive observations
In the light of retroactive conversations

conversations with our purchase
In the light of retroactive

conversations with our reactions
before we can have a retroactive

conversation with our feelings
One day was actually

Put in place as stationary destinations
I was enjoined to act again myself

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I was enjoined to act again

To that impossible place
and strategies not tactics

What the next step
Not goals or tactics

They are called aspirational
I am bid to act again

that their economic value 
I was enjoying acting against myself

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I am enjoined to act again

aspirating with visions
I was bid to act again myself

My associations
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
I was big to act again

I invited most of what came next
actually considering the end

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I refuse indelible tracts

all that I can think I want
I refuse indelible contracts

explicit statements
though not many facts up in the sky

What I do in my liesure
Though in not many acts

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in the simple act of reading

Can I clear it through emphatic seizure
though it is not a simple act

You can clear it also through static seizure
The simple act opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
we had inhabited actually

between that day
to the ends of my transactions

I designated 
The ends of my transactions

where I am aside at least
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

in the space that it had
To the ends of transactions

the way was water
to the ends of actions

The way that I am going
It’s not marshal exactly

The way that I was going
the other end transactions

battery dawn nights 
to the other end of actions

to the other end battery dawn 
It’s not marshall exactly

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
The other ends of my transactions

battery dawn 
to the other end of transactions

I answered what I thought
I turn not sad exactly

stopped light with validated fields
I return not sad exactly

to return what I bought
I returned not sad exactly

I learned my location
before I act on them

at home brought into privacy
