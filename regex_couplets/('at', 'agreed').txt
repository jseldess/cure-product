('at', 'agreed')

But that is beside the point
and to which I’ve agreed

if that has anything
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

found dated for my own purchases
and for which the plan agreed

I designated 
that agreed one of rest

in need one in that best own
and to which the plan agreed

When I'm watching my tv 
that agreed home

decisions that can be attributable
that agreed to one the people

that agreed one best
that agreed home to people

We ask say in that case
