('at', 'along')

But that is beside the point
bring your child along

What does it mean to drift
and bear children along

and not falling at all
The days lined along company

The days of private data
there was no walking along the pleasure

Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going
formerly along time they were on

that is by possessed
formerly along my say to the elections

I answered what I thought
drawn formerly along 

I assumed what I draw
along cables

where I am aside at least
mostly along cables

at least most days
shone formerly along time

stopped light with validated fields
formerly along the time they were on

That are my right to say
