('at', 'answer')

But that is beside the point
for the duration of the answer

for the creation of the universe
answered about 

from cables reheated travels
the duration of answers

for the duration of answers
by the sight of the hosting answered about

so still watch them
I answered about

stopped light with validated fields
washed I answered about

In what part did I lose trust
I answered what I thought

I assumed what I draw
at least for the duration of the answer

where I am aside at least
I answered while interfaced

battery dawn nights ending themselves
I answered what I thought about

That are my right to say
