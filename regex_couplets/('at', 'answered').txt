('at', 'answered')

But that is beside the point
answered about 

from cables reheated travels
by the sight of the hosting answered about

so still watch them
I answered about

stopped light with validated fields
washed I answered about

In what part did I lose trust
I answered what I thought

I assumed what I draw
I answered while interfaced

battery dawn nights ending themselves
I answered what I thought about

That are my right to say
