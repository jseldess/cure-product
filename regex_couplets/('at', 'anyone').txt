('at', 'anyone')

But that is beside the point
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

conversations with our reactions
Before anyone buys up the opening

I reach repeated expressions first
Before anyone walks across the opening

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field

and at my desk
