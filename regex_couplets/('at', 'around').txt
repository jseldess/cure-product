('at', 'around')

But that is beside the point
Spinning around the heart

Where I put it beating
around my country 

attesting this is a chance
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I watch a movie
Articles all around us

of those gathered
articles all around storming around

Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going
around the dogs and lillies

I watch a moving afterimage
I spin around

And from that great distance
around 

that hold and wish to hold
I spun around trying to touch the spots

And from a great distance
More reasons around my country 

trackers collecting data on users
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

where I am aside at least
and around redundant

and latency found
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

The way that I was going
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

battery dawn nights 
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

battery dawn
