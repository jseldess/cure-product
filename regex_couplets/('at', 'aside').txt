('at', 'aside')

But that is beside the point
aside from the retinas

I argued that the days were longer
But my not feeling the memory aside

trackers collecting data on users
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

sound inundated for my own purchases
where I send and relive aside

and found inundated
where I send and retrieve aside

I designated 
where I stand aside

where I am aside at least
where I am aside

the duration of answers
aside the impulse to my purpose

for the duration of the answer
But my feeling the memory aside

at least most days
recalling aside

my interfaced stand data
