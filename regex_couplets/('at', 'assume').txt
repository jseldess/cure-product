('at', 'assume')

But that is beside the point
I assumed it was visible

into rotating directionless 
I assumed 

if that has anything
I assumed what I draw

stopped light with validated fields
I assume the offers reliable

in that I cannot remember 
I assume the offers revisitable

that they were visible
I assume the offers divisible

that they were divisible
I assumed that they were divisible
