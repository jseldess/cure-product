('at', 'away')

But that is beside the point
drifting away

variegated reflected light
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I canâ€™t presume to treat others
drifting away needs

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
drifting away from the task

I let myself treat
Who throws contours away

the way that I was going
Formerly away there are constant ways

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
formerly away

battery dawn nights
