('at', 'Before')

But that is beside the point
Before we walk across the wide field

variegated reflected light
Before we walk across the wide opening

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

conversations with our reactions
Before anyone buys up the opening

I reach repeated expressions first
Before anyone walks across the opening

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field

and at my desk
Before morning goals

that having been after content
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

Its strategy comes before morning goals
