('at', 'bills')

But that is beside the point
between bills and stuffed animals

by the private preambles
I hear it between bills and stuff

I am told ventillation
I can hear it between bills and stuff

What I do in my liesure
I can hear them between bills and stuff

all that I can think I want
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I cannot hear it between bills

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
bills and stuffed animals

visions that can be attainable
