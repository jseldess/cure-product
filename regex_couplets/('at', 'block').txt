('at', 'block')

But that is beside the point
I want to find a way to block it incoming

I propogated repeated expressions first
I want to find a way to block it

I reach repeated expressions first
I want to find a way to block incoming

smile testing glance repeated expressions
I can find a way to block it incoming

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
I can find a way to block it

and at my desk
