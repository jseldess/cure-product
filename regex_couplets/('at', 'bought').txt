('at', 'bought')

But that is beside the point
bought in the sounded privacy

that is by possessed
bought in the surrounded privacy 

that is of I am possessed
to return what I bought

I learned my location
own stays bought loyal

that agreed one best
bought stays own loyal

We ask say in that case
