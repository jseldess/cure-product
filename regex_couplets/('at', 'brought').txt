('at', 'brought')

But that is beside the point
at home brought into privacy

So I find myself at home
already brought into privacy

by the private preambles
I brought my head down

and my heart rate
I brought my qualities down

Where official policy is to catch and release
which I brought down with qualities

Thatâ€™s when they really take
I brought my count down

path
own stays brought loyal

in need one in that best own
own that stays brought loyal

that in need one best own
that stays brought loyal

I ask say in that case
brought messageable to you

We ask say in that case
home stays brought loyal

that agreed to one the people
at home brought into private

revisions that can be attributable
brought messageable into privacy

brought into private messageably
brought into privacy

I resume the offers at home
