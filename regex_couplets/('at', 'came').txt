('at', 'came')

But that is beside the point
I invited most of what came next

that I was the arm of this
I came back to me

I watch a movie
I came after my past

I resume attributable visions
until the bill came

That I captured an afterimage
and came home to rewind inflections

decisions that can be attributable
and came home to rewind

revisions that can be attributable
