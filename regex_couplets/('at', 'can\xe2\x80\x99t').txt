('at', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

But that is beside the point
I can’t fix them without direction

into rotating and directionless space
and can’t presume to need

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

where I sleep at times
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
But I can’t let myself disregard

Others desires as legitimate
That can’t be glimpsed

with implicit regulations
Though we can’t help waiting

The way that I was going
Though we can’t help waiting for her

battery dawn nights 
I can’t remember them

that having been after content
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

in that possessive
