('at', 'children')

But that is beside the point
On a snow day with my children

variegated reflected light
as pure as my children

into rotating directionless 
my children’s consumption

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
about my children’s consumption

I reach repeated expressions first
only fragments of time with my children

and at my desk
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

But I can’t let myself treat 
To my children Walt Whitman

What Whitman
bearing children along

What does it mean to drift
and bear children along

and not falling at all
Even the children

 of those gathered
my possession of my children

that is of I am possessed
speech my possession of my children

that is by I am possessed
