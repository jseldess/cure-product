('at', 'code')

But that is beside the point
as long as I have access to the code

and at my desk
May I have your zip code

and my heart rate
I spend time online learning to code

dislocated and a person from a distance
learned without too much difficulty to code

I am told by the ventillation
Then I am learning to code

So I am told by the ventillation
I am learning to code

The ventillation rushes on
falling off the encoded end

What I do in my liesure
encoded off the end

that I can hear
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

I watch a movie
zipcode

that is by possessed
