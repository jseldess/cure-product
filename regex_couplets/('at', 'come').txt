('at', 'come')

But that is beside the point
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Strategy comes before morning

that having been after content
after having been contented Strategy comes before morning

Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
Its strategy comes before morning goals

Strategy comes before goals
and that man comes on to tell me 

Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going
and come home to remind inflections

in that I cannot remember
