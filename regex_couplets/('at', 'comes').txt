('at', 'comes')

But that is beside the point
Strategy comes before morning

that having been after content
after having been contented Strategy comes before morning

Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
Its strategy comes before morning goals

Strategy comes before goals
and that man comes on to tell me 

Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going
