('at', 'company')

But that is beside the point
Or the company

dislocated and a person from a distance
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating visions
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
The entire company

aspirating with visions
Since I had to hold the entire company

My associations
The days aligned for company

I argued that the days were longer
The days aligned long company

The days of private data
That company creates a life

aspirating with little visions
