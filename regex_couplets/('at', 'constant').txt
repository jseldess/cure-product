('at', 'constant')

But that is beside the point
with constant ways 

The way that I was going
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

to the other end battery dawn 
who throws a constant way

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
with no constant way

battery dawn nights 
with constant ways to the other end

I answered what I thought
