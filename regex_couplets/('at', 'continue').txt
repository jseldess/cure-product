('at', 'continue')

But that is beside the point
but it continued

aspirating with visions
but it continued rippling muscle

That company creates a life
no solid ground to continue along

Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going
I continue to presume

attributable visions
I continue to subsume

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I continue to consume

I watch a movie
Then I continue to dream then

I watch a moving afterimage
Then I continued to dream then

that I saw
I continued to dream then

And from that great distance
