and could be mapped and weighed

Thatâ€™s when they really take
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

path
until I could not tire 

What was the last time
until I could not be tired

I need an explicit statement
until I could not be hired

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
I could in effect credit

I resume attributable visions
I could consume the dream

I watch a movie
and we could inhabit the room easy

between that day
and could be inflected with reasons

decisions that can be attributable
