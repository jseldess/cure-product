('at', 'damage')

But that is beside the point
without ensuing damage

I resume attributable visions
while consuming damage

And from that great distance
without consumer damage

that nothing had gravity
without longer damage

so that nothing had gravity
without any further damage

That I captured an afterimage
without any longer damage

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
