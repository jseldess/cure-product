('at', 'day')

But that is beside the point
On a snow day with my children

variegated reflected light
One day there is direction

That’s exaclty what I want for them
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

and at my desk
On a day there will be direction

Put in place as stationary destinations
I argued the days felt longer

What’s the next step
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating visions
The days long aligned

that their economic value 
I argued the days were longer

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

when watching tv
The days aligned for company

aspirating with visions
The days are long

I argued that the days were longer
The days were long

my associations
The days were long aligned

The days of private data
The days of parsing data

That company creates a life
embodied everyday

that potential is there for you
The days of quantity 

The days of public data
The day

between that day
I have a memory between the day

I designated 
at least most days

where I’m watching my tv
