('at', 'days')

But that is beside the point
I argued the days felt longer

What’s the next step
The days long aligned

that their economic value 
I argued the days were longer

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I agrued the days were longer

when watching tv
The days aligned for company

aspirating with visions
The days are long

I argued that the days were longer
The days were long

my associations
The days were long aligned

The days of private data
The days of parsing data

That company creates a life
The days of quantity 

The days of public data
at least most days

where I’m watching my tv
