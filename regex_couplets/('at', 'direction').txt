('at', 'direction')

But that is beside the point
Whereas direction is beside the point

Where I sleep at times
into rotating directionless 

at home brought into privacy
Of course there is a direction

I reach repeated expressions first
One day there is direction

That’s exaclty what I want for them
on a day there will be direction

and at my desk
Actually one day there is direction

Put in place as stationary destinations
how can I know without direction

Stationary destination
in rotating directionless space

not rotating
I can’t fix them without direction

into rotating and directionless space
Though how can you know without direction

and then into rotating and directional space
for how can you know without direction

not even rotating
stopping off in all directions

I assumed that they were divisible
