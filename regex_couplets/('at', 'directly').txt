('at', 'directly')

But that is beside the point
if not directly on my skin

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
of not directly from my skin

and at my desk
But not to me directly

dislocated and a person from a distance
The sun high enough to enter directly 

it was not just a defeat
The sun high enough to strike directly

I assumed that they were divisible
