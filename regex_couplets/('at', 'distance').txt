('at', 'distance')

But that is beside the point
Falling from this distance

and not falling at all
A person from a distance

dislocated and a person from a distance
And from a weak distance

Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going
And from that great distance

I watch a movie
And from a great distance

to catch the spots
