('at', 'do')

But that is beside the point
The dogs and lillies

into rotating directionless 
in a sharp downward turn 

where I sleep at times
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

variegated reflected light
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
In a sharp downard turn

and not falling at all
It keeps coming down thankfully

In the light of retroactive conversations
does not feel an exception

But I can’t let myself treat 
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I constellate my time family country
What does it mean to drift

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
to the down arrow

That’s where I sleep at times
the down arrow

I let myself treat
I brought my head down

and my heart rate
I brought my qualities down

Where official policy is to catch and release
which I brought down with qualities

That’s when they really take
I put my bread down

path
I brought my count down

To that impossible place
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

Strategy comes before morning
What I do in my liesure

What would I feel without that goal
Undoubtedly 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I walk up and don’t work anymore

it was not just a defeat
So I work and don’t look any

attesting this is a chance
here is the site of the battle of maldon

I watch a movie
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

And from that great distance
around the dogs and lillies

I watch a moving afterimage
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

that nothing had gravity
and it doesn’t take long

burrowed about from repeated travels
latency which doesn’t mean anything

uses for the attention of the brand
I only think I don’t listen

in privacy that is messageable
For a while I think I don’t listen

All that I own messageable
