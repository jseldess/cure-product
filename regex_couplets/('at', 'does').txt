But that is beside the point
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

into rotating directionless 
does not feel an exception

But I can’t let myself treat 
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

What does it mean to drift

and not falling at all
and it doesn’t take long

burrowed about from repeated travels
latency which doesn’t mean anything

uses for the attention of the brand
