('at', 'down')

But that is beside the point
in a sharp downward turn 

where I sleep at times
In a sharp downard turn

and not falling at all
It keeps coming down thankfully

In the light of retroactive conversations
to the down arrow

That’s where I sleep at times
the down arrow

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I brought my head down

and my heart rate
I brought my qualities down

Where official policy is to catch and release
which I brought down with qualities

That’s when they really take
I put my bread down

path
I brought my count down

To that impossible place
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

I watch a movie
