('at', 'draw')

But that is beside the point
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

burrowed about from repeated travels
drawn formerly a long time

I assumed what I draw
drawn formerly rights blended themselves

I answered what I thought
drawn formerly along 

stopped light with validated fields
