('at', 'drift')

But that is beside the point
drifting away

variegated reflected light
drifting does not feel an exception

But I can’t let myself treat 
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to treat others
at any time it can drift again

I let myself treat
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I constellate my time family country
For whom drifting is not an exception

What Whitman
What does it mean to drift

and not falling at all
drifting away needs

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
drifting away from the task

Others desires as legitimate
