('at', 'earn')

But that is beside the point
in light of learning what we see

conversation with our feelings
When we had jobs that were to earn

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
I spend time online learning to code

dislocated and a person from a distance
learned without too much difficulty to code

I am told by the ventillation
Then I am learning to code

So I am told by the ventillation
I am learning to code

The ventillation rushes on
where you can earn more 

Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going
decisioned to learn 

I ask say in that case
decisioned to learn back

I designated 
phase decision for learning

that is by possessed
for learning by the prospect

that is of I am possessed
I learned my location

at the site of a purchase
I learned my point

rendered approximately
I learned my approximate point

that having been after content
a precision for learning

speech that is of by prospects
my daughter will learn 

that is by I am possessed
