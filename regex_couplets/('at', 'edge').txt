('at', 'edge')

But that is beside the point
I step off the edge

into rotating directionless 
off the edge of the world

variegated reflected light
Face falling off the edge of the face

I reach repeated expressions first
value falling off the edge of the face

of retroactive observations
The edge is put in place

Stationary destination
The edge isn’t even there

Rather it itself is rotating
I step over the edge

into rotating and directionless space
If I step on the edge

and then into rotating and directional space
If I step over the edge

not even rotating
Falling off the edge of the face

I’ll pull my data higher up
The value falling off the edge of the face

by no ventillation my purpose
The value falling off the edge of th face

I am told by no ventillation
and testing the edge and gravity

What’s the next step
