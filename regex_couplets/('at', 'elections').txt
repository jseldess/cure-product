('at', 'elections')

But that is beside the point
on my way to elections

that is by possessed
formerly my way to the elections

I answered what I thought
on a way to the elections

I assumed what I draw
formally a way to the elections

that is of I am possessed
formerly along my say to the elections

stopped light with validated fields
My say to the elections

That are my right to say
the right of my elections

my ethereal economic relations
I stay the right of my elections

to return what I bought
