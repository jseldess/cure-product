('at', 'else')

But that is beside the point
If you have confidence regardless all else

was not just a defeat
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going
and elsewhere my memory

though it was most emphatically that
and elsewhere my memory of you

trackers collecting data on users
elsewhere my purposes

designated 
elsewhere by my memory

so still watch them
By my memory elsewhere

In what part did I lose trust
in memory elsewhere

radiating from housing
but for memory elsewhere

I answered what I thought
in memory persisting elsewhere

I answered what I thought about
