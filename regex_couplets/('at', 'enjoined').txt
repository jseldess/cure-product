('at', 'enjoined')

But that is beside the point
I was enjoined to act again myself

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I was enjoined to act again

To that impossible place
I was enjoined to act

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I am enjoined to act again

aspirating with visions
I was enjoined to act against

I invited most of what came next
