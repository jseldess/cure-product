('at', 'exactly')

But that is beside the point
It’s not marshal exactly

The way that I was going
It’s not marshall exactly

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
I turn not sad exactly

stopped light with validated fields
I return not sad exactly

to return what I bought
I returned not sad exactly

I learned my location
