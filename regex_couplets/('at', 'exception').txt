('at', 'exception')

But that is beside the point
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

into rotating directionless 
does not feel an exception

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I constellate my time family country
For whom drifting is not an exception

What Whitman
