('at', 'fall')

But that is beside the point
Then fall then summer from my face

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
and not falling at all

I reach repeated expressions first
Face falling off the edge of the face

of retroactive observations
Then fall then summer

In the light of retroactive conversations
value falling off the edge of the face

Then I constellate my time family country
The value falling off the edge of the face

I’ll pull my data higher up
The value falling off the edge of th face

by no ventillation my purpose
I see only the back of falling values

What the next step
I see the back of falling values

of the habits I create
I can see only the back of falling values

What’s the next step
I can see only values falling back

of the habits they create
falling off the encoded end

What I do in my liesure
I take it out in the snow fall

What would I feel without that goal
falling off the end

that I can hear
The first falling syllable

all that I can think I want
falling off the end of the world

I even know what I would find
falling off the end of the word

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
