('at', 'front')

But that is beside the point
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

That’s exaclty what I want for them
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

and my heart rate
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Its strategy comes before morning goals
in front of the set afternoon

What’s the next step
in front of the set of regulations

with internally regulated climate
And need out in front purchase

 of those gathered
behind or out front or up above

I learned my location
