('at', 'full')

But that is beside the point
It keeps coming down thankfully

In the light of retroactive conversations
I am full of potential

I argued that the days were longer
with full potential to movement

I invited most of what came next
full of aspirations

embodied with little aspirations
full of potential

The days of private data
full of the missing words

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
still carefully

stopped light with validated fields
