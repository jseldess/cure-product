('at', 'get')

But that is beside the point
I’ll get there eventually

Then I constellate my time family country
and is relentlessly budgeted

where I sleep at times
I’ll get there ruins

Out of later results
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Its strategy comes before morning goals
I get through there

in the sense of watching
I get from here through there

I watch a movie
in traversing get through there

I resume attributable visions
get from here through there

attributable visions
I get here through there

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
forgetting decisions 

that agreed one of rest
forgettable

that they were divisible
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

that decisions can be attributable
and maybe forgettable
