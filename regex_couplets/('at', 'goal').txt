('at', 'goal')

But that is beside the point
Though there are quarters goals

Put in place as stationary destinations
We can wrestle them with their goals

into rotating and directionless space
We can rest there in them with their goals

and then into rotating and directional space
and without quartely goals

Then I constellate my time family country
There are quarterly goals

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
before morning goals

I am told by no ventillation
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

Its strategy comes before morning goals
Strategy comes before goals

What the next step
not goals

of the habits I create
Not goals or tactics

They are called aspirational
What would I feel without that goal

What would I feel without a goal
