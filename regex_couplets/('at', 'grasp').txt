('at', 'grasp')

But that is beside the point
having been graspable

that can be attributable
having been an ungraspable time

I watch a movie
Under the grasp principle

that I saw
for an ungraspable purchase

 of those gathered
And for an ungraspable time

Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going
