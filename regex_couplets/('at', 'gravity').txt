('at', 'gravity')

But that is beside the point
and testing the edge and gravity

What’s the next step
where I need gravity

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
Where I lead gravity

And from that great distance
I tell you where I need gravity

I watch a movie
that nothing had gravity

so that nothing had gravity
My means without gravity

That I captured an afterimage
