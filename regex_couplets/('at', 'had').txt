('at', 'had')

But that is beside the point
If he had not carried one virtue

the latter
When we had jobs that were to earn

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
when we had jobs that was to churn some bread

attesting this is a chance
I had me a vision

I am told ventillation
Since I had to hold the entire company

aspirating with visions
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

I invited most of what came next
I had nightmares though

that I was the arm of this
I had to tell them the news

That company creates a life
The long time I had a vision

What would I feel without that goal
I had a vision

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
we had to say goodbye

of those gathered
We had to say goodbye there

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
that nothing had gravity

so that nothing had gravity
we had inhabited actually

between that day
in the space that it had

if that has anything
in the face that I had

The way that she is going
though we are breaking in the space that it had

found dated for my own purchases
which had on honor to be told

latency which doesn’t mean anything
in the face that it had

what literally moved
I had entered my phone

stopped light with validated fields
