('at', 'have')

But that is beside the point
We’ll have coffee this morning

Where I sleep at times
I have entered my phone

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
before we can have a retroactive

conversation with our feelings
as long as I have access to the code

and at my desk
if you have providence to excess

the latter
If you have confidence regardless all else

was not just a defeat
May I have your zip code

and my heart rate
I have them lost

that having been after content
I have supporters

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I have a memory between the day

I designated 
I have entered my purposes

trackers collecting data on users
They have very many choices

More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

in the space that it had
I have turned it off

the way that I was going
and have no way

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
I have them trust in me

I swayed a little in my state
I have seen more than I can remember

that decisions can be attributable
Or can have seen offering possession

I assumed that they were divisible
can have seen offering possession

in that I cannot remember 
You can have seen offering
