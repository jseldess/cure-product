('at', 'hear')

But that is beside the point
You can hear it also through your leisure

But I can’t let myself treat 
and my heart rate

Where official policy is to catch and release
and my heartrate

of later results
Spinning around the heart

Where I put it beating
I hear it between bills and stuff

I am told ventillation
I can hear it between bills and stuff

What I do in my liesure
that I can hear

all that I can think I want
as far back as my history heard

What was the last time
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I even know what I would find
that I hear without trying

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
but I can hear them

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
You can hear it also through static leisure

You can clear it also through static leisure
In my heart did I lose trust

In what part did I lose trust
