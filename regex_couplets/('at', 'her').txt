('at', 'her')

But that is beside the point
Where I sleep at times

into rotating directionless 
Whereas direction is beside the point

at home brought into privacy
The prospects there already

by the private preambles
I’ll pull myself another personality type

variegated reflected light
I’ll get there eventually

Then I constellate my time family country
I told her a story, she drew waves.

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Of course there is a direction

I reach repeated expressions first
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
One day there is direction

That’s exaclty what I want for them
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

and at my desk
On a day there will be direction

Put in place as stationary destinations
The edge isn’t even there

Rather it itself is rotating
Though there are quarters goals

not rotating
there are quarters 

into rotating and directionless space
We can rest there in them with their goals

and then into rotating and directional space
what I find there

attempted anachronism
others desires

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
There are quarterly goals

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
here described

the latter
If I let myself see others desires

at any time it can drift again
That’s where I sleep at times

I let myself treat
Others desires as legitimate

and not falling at all
I’ll pull my data higher up

I’ll pull my data
higher up in the internet

I am told ventillation
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

So I constellate the time family country
To neither study

was not just a defeat
Where official policy is to catch and release

and my heart rate
Where I put it beating

of later pages
higher up in the results

To that impossible place
I’ll get there ruins

Out of later results
where I can lay claim to ruins

hovering above standing water
where I can claim to see the ruins

emerging this year from standing water
from where I can claim

emerging this year from too much standing water
there was no promotion

executive breath
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
that potential is there for you

That company creates a life
but would I love her the same

What I do in my liesure
Where I take my liesure

What would I feel without that goal
there was no walking along the pleasure

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
On the other hand

explicit statements
there was no television to hear

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
but where is it

attesting this is a chance
I get through there

in the sense of watching
I get from here through there

I watch a movie
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

I watch a moving afterimage
in traversing get through there

I resume attributable visions
get from here through there

attributable visions
I get here through there

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
here is the site of the battle of maldon

that I saw
And we had to say goodbye to her there

of those gathered
We had to say goodbye there

And from that great distance
Where I lead gravity

that hold and wish to hold
where I need gravity

And from a great distance
There are spots waiting

that nothing had gravity
without any further damage

so that nothing had gravity
Though we are waiting for her

between that day
Where in me did I host

I designated 
if there is anything 

if that has anything
Where I host my purposes

though it was most emphatically that

elsewhere my purposes

designated 
where I send and relive would be held

found dated for my own purchases
where I stand and relive

sound inundated for my own purchases
where I send and relive aside

and found inundated
Elsewhere my memory

in the space that it had
where I end

and drowned inundated
where I send and relive

where I am aside at least
the point where I am

burrowed about from repeated travels
where I stand and retrieve and relive

the duration of answers
where I end and relive

for the duration of answers
where I blend and relive

and latently from constituents
I presume to others

that agreed one of rest
Elsewhere by my memory

When I'm watching my tv 
there wasn’t any television 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Where in me did I lose

what literally moved
Where in me did I loose

so still watch them
Where in me pre-worn

stopped light with validated fields
By my memory elsewhere

In what part did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

the way was water
with her waves

The way that I am going
My daughter with her way

The way that I was going
with her way

battery dawn nights 
to the other end of actions

to the other end battery dawn 
the other end transactions

battery dawn 
to the other end

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
to their other end

I answered what I thought
where rights ended themselves

I assumed what I draw
where I send and retrieve aside

for the duration of the answer
where I send and retrieve relive

from cables reheated travels
where I am aside

where I’m watching my tv
firing and connecting somewhere

at least most days
in memory elsewhere

radiating from housing
but for memory elsewhere

I answered what I thought about
where lights blended themselves

That are my right to say
Cereal and others’ health

my ethereal economic relations
I learned the point where I am

rendered approximately
where the tongue rippled

state kept owned impression
The offers there already

at home brought into private
traffick is there nonetheless

The prospect for careening attached
I assume possession to others

in that I cannot remember 
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
