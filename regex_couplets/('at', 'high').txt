('at', 'high')

But that is beside the point
way high up in the inter

executive breath
I’ll pull my data higher up

I’ll pull my data
higher up in the internet

and not falling at all
way high up in the internet

execute breath
higher up in the results

To that impossible place
high in the content architecture

hovering above standing water
high up in the architecture

emerging this year from standing water
high up in the internet

I am told ventillation
I’ll pull myself higher up

by no ventillation my purpose
your bid to the next highest ranked network

They are called aspirational
The sun high enough to enter directly 

it was not just a defeat
The sun high enough to strike directly

I assumed that they were divisible
