('at', 'hold')

But that is beside the point
I take hold of my finger

So I constellate the time family country
When they really take hold of my finger

Thatâ€™s when they really take
hold at intervals riding forward

at intervals while riding forward
Since I had to hold the entire company

aspirating with visions
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

I invited most of what came next
and hold and wish to hold

I resume attributable visions
designed to hold up my underwear

that hold and wish to hold
