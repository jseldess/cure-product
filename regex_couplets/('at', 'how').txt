('at', 'how')

But that is beside the point
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
how can I know without direction

Stationary destination
Though how can you know without direction

into rotating and directionless space
for how can you know without direction

not even rotating
who knows how to turn it off

The way that I was going
