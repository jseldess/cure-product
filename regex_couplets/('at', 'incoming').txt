('at', 'incoming')

But that is beside the point
I want to find a way to block it incoming

I propogated repeated expressions first
I want to find a way to block incoming

smile testing glance repeated expressions
I can find a way to block it incoming

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
from the incoming stream

and at my desk
