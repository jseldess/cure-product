('at', 'indelible')

But that is beside the point
I reuse indelible tracks 

What I do in my liesure
I refuse indelible tracts

all that I can think I want
I refuse indelible contracts

explicit statements
I resume indelible tracks

What was the last time
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
