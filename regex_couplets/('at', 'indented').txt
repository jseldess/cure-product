('at', 'indented')

But that is beside the point
reflexing indented in my phone

that will spur me on
reflexing indented in my moan

that their knowing
state reflexing indented in my own

state kept moaned impression
my reflexing indented in my own tongue

in my state
reflexing indented in my own

state indented in my own
indented into an own

state kept owned impression
indented in my own

We ask say in that case
