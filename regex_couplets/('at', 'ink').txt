('at', 'ink')

But that is beside the point
ink

the latter
all that I can think I want

What I do in my liesure
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

What was the last time
I only think I don’t listen

in privacy that is messageable
For a while I think I don’t listen

All that I own messageable
