('at', 'last')

But that is beside the point
What was the last time

all that I can think I want
under the last seen principle

I resume attributable visions
Under the last principle 

of those gathered
Under the last principle of purchasing power

Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going
Where in me did I last

and found inundated
last night

with the latency last night
with a latency last night

and latency found
