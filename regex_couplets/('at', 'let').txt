('at', 'let')

But that is beside the point
But I can’t let myself treat 

where I sleep at times
If I let myself see others desires

Then I can’t presume to treat others
I let myself treat

Then I constellate my time family country
But I can’t let myself disregard

Others desires as legitimate
It’s the third letter from the end

What the next step
I let it remind me again

And from that great distance
