('at', 'light')

But that is beside the point
variegated reflected light

Then I constellate my time family country
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

stopped light with validated variegated fields
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light

and not falling at all
In the retroactive light

of retroactive observations
In the light of retroactive conversations

conversations with our purchase
In the light of retroactive

conversations with our reactions
in light of learning what we see

conversation with our feelings
stopped light with validated fields

battery dawn nights blending themselves
where lights blended themselves

I assumed what I draw
stopped light with validated faces

where I am aside at least
