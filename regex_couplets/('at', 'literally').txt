('at', 'literally')

But that is beside the point
and literally moved

if that has anything
as it was designed literally

found dated for my own purchases
and literally unproved

and found inundated
literally unproved 

and drowned inundated
myself moved literally as it is

I designated 
I literally moved

in the space that it had
and move them literally with me

latency which doesn’t mean anything
and literally moved about

that is by possessed
literally moved

what literally moved
not literally moved about

so still watch them
not literally moved

to return what I bought
