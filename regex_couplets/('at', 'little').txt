('at', 'little')

But that is beside the point
with little reason to move

I argued that the days were longer
with little reasons to aspiration

embodied aspirations
embodied with little visions

I invited most of what came next
There was very little physical activity

my associations
with little reasons to move

full of aspirations
embodied with little aspirations

The days of private data
aspirating with little visions

I aspirate with little vision
with little reason to aspiration

that potential is there for you
embodied with little reason

What I do in my liesure
I swayed a little in my state

that will spur me on
