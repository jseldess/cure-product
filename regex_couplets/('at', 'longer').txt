('at', 'longer')

But that is beside the point
I argued the days felt longer

Whatâ€™s the next step
I argued the days were longer

that their economic value 
I agrued the days were longer

when watching tv
I argued that the days were longer

my associations
without longer damage

so that nothing had gravity
without any longer damage

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
