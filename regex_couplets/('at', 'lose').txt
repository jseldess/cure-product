('at', 'lose')

But that is beside the point
even when close to my owning

I watch a movie
even when close to my knowing

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Where in me did I lose

what literally moved
Where in me did I lose trust

In what part did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

the way was water
