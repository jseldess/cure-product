But that is beside the point
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

into rotating directionless 
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

What Whitman
Walt Whitman drifted

and not falling at all
There are performance reviews

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
not many face up

all that I can think I want
though not many freeze up

explicit statements
though not many facts up in the sky

What I do in my liesure
in not many tracks up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Though in not many acts

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

here is the site of the battle of maldon
They have very many choices

The many transparent pixel calls

The way that I was going
