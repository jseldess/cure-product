('at', 'middle')

But that is beside the point
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

So I constellate the time family country
stopping in the middle

decisions that can be attributable
stepping in the middle

at home brought into privacy
stepping off into the middle

revisions that can be attributable
stepping off in to the middle

in that I cannot remember
