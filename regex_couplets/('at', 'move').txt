('at', 'move')

But that is beside the point
since I can imagine movement

I argued that the days were longer
with little reasons to move

embodied aspirations
with little reason to move

I invited most of what came next
with full potential to movement

my associations
since you can imagine movement

That company creates a life
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
and literally moved

if that has anything
myself moved literally as it is

I designated 
I move

in the space that it had
and move them literally with me

latency which doesn’t mean anything
and literally moved about

that is by possessed
I literally moved

When I'm watching my tv 
literally moved

what literally moved
not literally moved about

so still watch them
also didn’t really move

my interfaced stand data
not literally moved

to return what I bought
