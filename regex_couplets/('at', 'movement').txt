('at', 'movement')

But that is beside the point
since I can imagine movement

I argued that the days were longer
with full potential to movement

I invited most of what came next
since you can imagine movement

my associations
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
