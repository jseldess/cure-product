('at', 'myself')

But that is beside the point
So I find myself at home

by the private preambles
I’ll pull myself another personality type

variegated reflected light
But I can’t let myself treat 

where I sleep at times
If I let myself see others desires

Then I can’t presume to treat others
I let myself treat

Then I constellate my time family country
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

and not falling at all
I was enjoined to act again myself

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
But I can’t let myself disregard

Others desires as legitimate
And make myself a visible

I’ll pull my data
I’ll pull myself higher up

I am told ventillation
I keep turning back again myself

and my heart rate
off the end myself

that their economic value 
I was enjoying acting against myself

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I was bid to act again myself

aspirating with visions
myself

uses for the attention of the brand
myself moved literally as it is

I designated 
the least productive of myself

where I’m watching my tv
at least instructive of myself

at least for the duration of the answer
So I found myself at home

at home brought into private
