('at', 'now')

But that is beside the point
On a snow day with my children

variegated reflected light
who knows the way

stopped light with validated variegated fields
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

and at my desk
how can I know without direction

Stationary destination
Though how can you know without direction

into rotating and directionless space
for how can you know without direction

not even rotating
Right now I’m the cart

and not falling at all
out in the snow

I am told by no ventillation
out in the snow fall

What’s the next step
out in the snow falling face value

of the habits they create
I take it out in the snow fall

What would I feel without that goal
I even know what I would find

that I can hear
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

What I do in my liesure
even when close to my knowing

I watch a movie
When closed to my knowing

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
knowing the constituents

and latency found
who knows how to turn it off

The way that I was going
who know the ways to their other end

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
that their knowing

in my state
