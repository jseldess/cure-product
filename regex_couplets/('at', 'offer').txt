('at', 'offer')

But that is beside the point
So I presume the offers already

at home brought into privacy
in the form filled offered in trust

I designated 
in the form filled offered trust

so still watch them
in the form filled offered must

In what part did I lose trust
in track as offer asked 

that is by possessed
I assume the offers reliable

in that I cannot remember 
I assume the offers revisitable

that they were visible
I presume the offers

revisions that can be attributable
The offers there already

at home brought into private
So I resume the offers already

at home visions can be attainable
I offer to you

that this is possible
So I presume the offers

So I presume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home
presume the offers at 

in privacy that is messageable
I assume the offers divisible

that they were divisible
Or can have seen offering possession

I assumed that they were divisible
seen having or offering possession
