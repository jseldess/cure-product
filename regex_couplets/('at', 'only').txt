('at', 'only')

But that is beside the point
only fragments of time with my children

and at my desk
only in the case

was not just a defeat
So that I notice I am the only one

The ventillation rushes on
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

Strategy comes before morning
I see only the back of falling values

What the next step
I see only the back

of the habits I create
I can see only the back of falling values

What’s the next step
The planning process is for visionaries only

and strategies not tactics
I see only the back of my habits

Aspirational strategy
I can see only values falling back

of the habits they create
I can see only the back of their economic value

That you can see only the back of
then I can see only the back values

they create
would only willingly break

and latently from constituents
only from constituents

with latency from constituents
only with the latency 

with the latency last night
would only willingly speak

with a latency last night
if only on the way to the trash

So I found myself at home
I only think I don’t listen

in privacy that is messageable
less only money

that catch
