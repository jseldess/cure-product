('at', 'opening')

But that is beside the point
Before we walk across the wide opening

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

conversations with our reactions
Before anyone buys up the opening

I reach repeated expressions first
Before anyone walks across the opening

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
The simple act opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static seizure
The simple act of opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
in the simple act of opening a book

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
