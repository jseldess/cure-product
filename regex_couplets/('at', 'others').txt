('at', 'others')

But that is beside the point
others desires

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

where I sleep at times
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to treat others
If I let myself see others desires

at any time it can drift again
I presume to others

that agreed one of rest
Cereal and others’ health

my ethereal economic relations
I assume possession to others

in that I cannot remember 
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
