('at', 'our')

But that is beside the point
reasons resources

where I sleep at times
conversations with our purchase

What is an impure product
conversations with our reactions

conversations with our feelings
Of course there is a direction

I reach repeated expressions first
conversation with our feelings

in light of learning what we see
You can hear it also through your leisure

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
bring your child along

What does it mean to drift
Two hours and

and my heart rate
or an available resource

I am told ventillation
with four key value pairs

with implicit regulations
your bid to the next highest ranked network

They are called aspirational
or alter of course the time anyway

between that day
This is your voice 

was not just a defeat
This is your choice 

attesting this is a chance
This is your chance

trackers collecting data on users
Who throws contours away

the way that I was going
who throws contours a way

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
The contours exchange with you

battery dawn nights 
phrase them of our possessions

decisions that can be attributable
own best form to ourselves

that agreed one best
ensure to ourselves

that agreed to one the people
and our 

that agreed home to people
home rest form to ourselves 

We ask say in that case
