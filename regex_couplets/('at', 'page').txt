('at', 'page')

But that is beside the point
out of remnant pages

and my heart rate
Out of the back page ruins

Where I put it beating
of later pages

Out of the remnants of later pages
Out of the remnant pages

of later ruins
Out of the remnant pages of later ruins

dislocated and a person from a distance
Remnant continuous pages

Thatâ€™s when they really take
of later pages ruins results

of later results
Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture

hovering above standing water
