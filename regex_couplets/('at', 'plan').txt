('at', 'plan')

But that is beside the point
and is relentlessly planned

Then I constellate my time family country
The planning process for visions

What the next step
I see the back of the planning process

of the habits I create
The planning process is for visionaries only

and strategies not tactics
the planning process for decisions

Aspirational strategy
and for which the plan agreed

I designated 
and to which the plan agreed

When I'm watching my tv
