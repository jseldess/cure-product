('at', 'pleasure')

But that is beside the point
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Which is a pleasure to never live out

So I constellate the time family country
there was no walking along the pleasure

Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going
up in the television pleasure

What I do in my liesure
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

What was the last time
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Can I clear it through emphatic seizure
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
