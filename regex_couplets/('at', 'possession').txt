('at', 'possession')

But that is beside the point
I speak to them my possessions

latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything
my possessions

that is by possessed
my possession of my children

that is of I am possessed
I speak them of my possessions

that is by I am possessed
speak them of my possessions

I designated 
speech my possession of my children

that agreed one of rest
phrase them of my possessions

we ask say in that case
I stay the right of my possessions 

to return what I bought
the right of possessions

I learned my location
possessions people

that having been after content
phrase them of our possessions

decisions that can be attributable
possessions

that agreed home
Or can have seen offering possession

I assumed that they were divisible
seen having or offering possession

in that I cannot remember 
can have seen offering possession
