('at', 'potential')

But that is beside the point
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
I am full of potential

I argued that the days were longer
with full potential to movement

I invited most of what came next
full of potential

The days of private data
that potential is there for you

That company creates a life
