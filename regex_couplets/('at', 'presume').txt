('at', 'presume')

But that is beside the point
So I presume the offers already

at home brought into privacy
and can’t presume to need

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

where I sleep at times
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to treat others
Then I can’t presume to feed others

at any time it can drift again
I continue to presume

attributable visions
I presume to others

that agreed one of rest
I presume the offers

revisions that can be attributable
So I presume the offers

So I presume the offers at home already
presume the offers at 

in privacy that is messageable
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

in that I cannot remember
