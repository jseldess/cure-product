('at', 'principle')

But that is beside the point
under the last seen principle

I resume attributable visions
Under the grass principle

I watch a movie
Under the grasp principle

that I saw
Under the last principle 

of those gathered
under the past principle

Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going
