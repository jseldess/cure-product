('at', 'privacy')

But that is beside the point
at home brought into privacy

So I find myself at home
already brought into privacy

by the private preambles
by in the sound privacy

we ask say in that case
by in the sounded privacy

I ask say in that case
buy in the surrounded privacy

that is by possessed
bought in the sounded privacy

that is of I am possessed
buy in the sound privacy

decisions that can be attributable
bought in the surrounded privacy 

that is by I am possessed
brought messageable into privacy

brought into private messageably
brought into privacy

I resume the offers at home
in privacy that is messageable

I resume at home
