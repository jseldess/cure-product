('at', 'product')

But that is beside the point
an impure product

variegated reflected light
What is an impure product

too sunny to eat ice cream
as a cure product

But I can’t let myself treat 
as a pure product

where I sleep at times
as an impure product

Then I can’t presume to treat others
the least productive of myself

where I’m watching my tv
