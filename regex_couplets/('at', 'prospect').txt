('at', 'prospect')

But that is beside the point
The prospects there already

by the private preambles
the impulse for my own prospects

trackers collecting data on users
the impulse my own prospects

I designated 
stopping into the prospect

in the space that it had
speech that is of by prospects

we ask say in that case
step in by the prospect

I ask say in that case
phase decisioned by the prospect

I ask say in that phase decisioned
for learning by the prospect

that is by possessed
decisioned by the prospect

that is of I am possessed
step by into the prospect

that is by I am possessed
the prospects being seen by me

at home brought into private
The prospect of seeing healthily 

at home brought into privacy
The prospect for careening attached

that catch
