('at', 'pull')

But that is beside the point
I’ll pull myself another personality type

variegated reflected light
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

and not falling at all
I’ll pull my data higher up

I’ll pull my data
I’ll pull myself higher up

I am told ventillation
fish pulled out of the lake

and my heart rate
