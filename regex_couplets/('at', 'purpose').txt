('at', 'purpose')

But that is beside the point
by no ventillation my purpose

I am told by no ventillation
until my purpose up in the sky

So I constellate the time family country
until I purpose the horizon

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
of my purpose in versing

in the sense of watching
in traversing my purpose

that having been after content
in conversing of my purpose

that will spur me on
of my purpose in conversing

I watch a movie
in pursuing my purpose

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
My purpose up in the sky

 of those gathered
I tell you my purposes

Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going
I tell you the weight of my purposes

I watch a moving afterimage
Where I host my purposes

was not just a defeat
I have entered my purposes

trackers collecting data on users
entered into my purposes

data collection on users
elsewhere my purposes

designated 
the impulse for my own purposes

I designated 
the impulse to my purpose

where I am aside at least
to the other end of my purpose

I answered what I thought
aside the impulse to my purpose

for the duration of the answer
for my own purposes

to return what I bought
