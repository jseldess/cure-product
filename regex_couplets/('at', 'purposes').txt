('at', 'purposes')

But that is beside the point
I tell you my purposes

Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going
I tell you the weight of my purposes

I watch a movie
Where I host my purposes

was not just a defeat
I have entered my purposes

trackers collecting data on users
entered into my purposes

data collection on users
elsewhere my purposes

designated 
the impulse for my own purposes

I designated 
for my own purposes

to return what I bought
