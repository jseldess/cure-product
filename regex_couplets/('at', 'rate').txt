('at', 'rate')

But that is beside the point
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
and my heart rate

Where official policy is to catch and release
and my heartrate

of later results
Strategy comes before morning

that having been after content
after having been contented Strategy comes before morning

Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
Its strategy comes before morning goals

Strategy comes before goals
and strategies not tactics

What the next step
Aspirational strategy

of the habits they create
I aspirate with little vision

with little reason to aspiration
