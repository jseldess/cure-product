('at', 'really')

But that is beside the point
because it was really dark

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
it was really sunny

too sunny to eat ice cream
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
When they really take hold of my finger

That’s when they really take
without really agreeing

if that has anything
without really speaking

though we are breaking in the space that it had
without really breaking

and drowned inundated
without really branding 

uses for the attention of the brand
without really binding

I designated 
without really needing

latency which doesn’t mean anything
also didn’t really move

my interfaced stand data
