('at', 'reasons')

But that is beside the point
reasons resources

where I sleep at times
with reasons

When we had jobs that were to earn
with little reasons to aspiration

embodied aspirations
with little reasons to move

full of aspirations
Toward the start informally given my reasons

attesting this is a chance
More reasons around my country 

trackers collecting data on users
and could be inflected with reasons

decisions that can be attributable
