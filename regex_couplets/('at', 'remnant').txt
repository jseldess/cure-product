('at', 'remnant')

But that is beside the point
out of remnant pages

and my heart rate
Out of the remnant ruins

and my heartrate
Out of the remnants 

of later pages
Out of the remnants of later pages

of later results
Out of the remnant pages

of later ruins
Out of the remnant pages of later ruins

Where I put it beating
remnant continuous pages

Thatâ€™s when they really take
out of remnant ages

To that impossible place
