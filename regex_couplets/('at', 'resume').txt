('at', 'resume')

But that is beside the point
So I presume the offers already

at home brought into privacy
and can’t presume to need

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

where I sleep at times
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to treat others
Then I can’t presume to feed others

at any time it can drift again
I resume unassimilable visions

What I do in my liesure
I resume indelible tracks

What was the last time
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I resume attributable visions

You can hear it also through static leisure
I continue to presume

attributable visions
I presume to others

that agreed one of rest
I presume the offers

revisions that can be attributable
So I resume the offers already

at home visions can be attainable
So I presume the offers

So I presume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home
I resume at home

presume the offers at 
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

in that I cannot remember
