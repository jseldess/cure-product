('at', 'retroactive')

But that is beside the point
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

stopped light with validated variegated fields
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light

and not falling at all
In the retroactive light

of retroactive observations
In the light of retroactive conversations

conversations with our purchase
In the light of retroactive

conversations with our reactions
before we can have a retroactive

conversation with our feelings
