('at', 'rotating')

But that is beside the point
into rotating directionless 

Where I sleep at times
Rather it itself is rotating

And put in place as though stationary
in rotating directionless space

not rotating
into rotating and directionless space

and then into rotating and directional space
or not even rotating

not even rotating
