('at', 'seen')

But that is beside the point
under the last seen principle

I resume attributable visions
Having seen more than 

that is by possessed
being seen by me

So I found myself at home
the prospects being seen by me

at home brought into private
Having seen more than I can remember 

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
I have seen more than I can remember

that decisions can be attributable
Or can have seen offering possession

I assumed that they were divisible
seen having or offering possession

in that I cannot remember 
can have seen offering possession
