('at', 'side')

But that is beside the point
Whereas direction is beside the point

Where I sleep at times
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

into rotating directionless 
I’m simply inside

and at my desk
aside from the retinas

I argued that the days were longer
actually considering the end

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
But my not feeling the memory aside

trackers collecting data on users
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

sound inundated for my own purchases
where I send and relive aside

and found inundated
where I send and retrieve aside

I designated 
But my not feeling the memory inside

where I am aside at least
where I am aside

the duration of answers
by the side of the hosting service

so still watch them
By my feeling the memory inside

The way that I was going
44 seconds inside

I answered what I thought
where I stand aside

for the duration of the answer
But my feeling the memory aside

at least most days
recalling aside

my interfaced stand data
