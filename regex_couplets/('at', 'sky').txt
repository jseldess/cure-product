('at', 'sky')

But that is beside the point
over the long time up in the sky

Then I constellate my time family country
over the long line up in the sky

I am told by no ventillation
Blue sky or

and my heart rate
until my purpose up in the sky

by no ventillation my purpose
though not many facts up in the sky

What I do in my liesure
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in not many tracks up in the sky

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Up in the sky

 of those gathered
While they’re up in the sky

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
until I purchase up the sky

And from that great distance
While we’re up in the sky

to catch the spots
until I purchase up in the sky

And from a great distance
