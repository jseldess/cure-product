('at', 'spots')

But that is beside the point
white spots on a black surface

What I do in my liesure
but they are black spots

all that I can think I want
black spots on a white surface

What was the last time
simple black spots

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
all the spots

to catch the spots
I spun around trying to touch the spots

And from a great distance
