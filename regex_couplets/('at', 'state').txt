('at', 'state')

But that is beside the point
explicit statements

What I do in my liesure
wrapped in static and explicit statements

What was the last time
wrapped in static implicit statements

I need an explicit statement
which I needed for an explicit state

So I constellate the time family country
for an explicit state

while wrapped in explicit static
like state mirror

I resume attributable visions
I swayed a little in my state

that will spur me on
in my state

state reflexing indented in my own
state kept moaned impression

My state kept loaned impression
state indented in my own

state kept owned impression
