('at', 'static')

But that is beside the point
wrapped in static and explicit statements

What was the last time
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

wrapped in static implicit statements
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Can I clear it through emphatic seizure
You can clear it also through static seizure

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure

You can clear it also through static siezure
You can hear it also through static leisure

You can clear it also through static leisure
wrapped in static

I resume attributable visions
while wrapped in static

I need an explicit statement
while wrapped in explicit static

flattening my reception
while weâ€™re wrapped in static

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
