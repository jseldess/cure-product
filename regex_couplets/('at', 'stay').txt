('at', 'stay')

But that is beside the point
wrestling to stay still

not rotating
wrestling me to stay still

into rotating and directionless space
So stay with us

aspirating with little visions
own stays brought loyal

in need one in that best own
own that stays brought loyal

that in need one best own
that stays brought loyal

I ask say in that case
I stay the right of my elections

to return what I bought
home stays brought loyal

that agreed to one the people
own stays bought loyal

that agreed one best
bought stays own loyal

We ask say in that case
