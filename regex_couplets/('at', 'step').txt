('at', 'step')

But that is beside the point
I step off the edge

into rotating directionless 
I step over the edge

into rotating and directionless space
If I step on the edge

and then into rotating and directional space
If I step over the edge

not even rotating
What the next step

of the habits I create
Whatâ€™s the next step

and strategies not tactics
The next step 

Aspirational strategy
from which to step off

That company creates a life
step in by the prospect

I ask say in that case
phase decision step in

that is by possessed
step by into the prospect

that is of I am possessed
stepping in the middle

at home brought into privacy
stepping off into the middle

revisions that can be attributable
stepping off in to the middle

in that I cannot remember
