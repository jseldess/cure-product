('at', 'still')

But that is beside the point
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

into rotating directionless 
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
That is itself not still

As though stationary and a destination
wrestling to stay still

not rotating
wrestling me to stay still

into rotating and directionless space
I love my daughter still

What I do in my liesure
though we are still breaking in

The way that she is going
still wash conserving

so still watch them
my in-laws still wash conserving

stopped light with validated fields
so still them

In what part did I lose trust
