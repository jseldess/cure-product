('at', 'suspend')

But that is beside the point
Ask who I am to suspend

Where I sleep at times
I suspend live connections to you

into rotating directionless 
I suspend my connections to you

at home brought into privacy
I wear suspenders

And from that great distance
suspenders

that hold and wish to hold
