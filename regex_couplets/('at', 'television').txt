('at', 'television')

But that is beside the point
there wasn’t any television 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
up in the television pleasure

What I do in my liesure
up in the television

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
there was no television to hear

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
joined in my television

my interfaced stand data
