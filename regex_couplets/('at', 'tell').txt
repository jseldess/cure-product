('at', 'tell')

But that is beside the point
Then I constellate my time family country

where I sleep at times
So I constellate the time family country

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I constellate the time

When we had jobs that were to earn
The CEO tells me to embody values

dislocated and a person from a distance
I had to tell them the news

That company creates a life
I tell you my purposes

Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I watch a movie
and that man comes on to tell me 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
