('at', 'themselves')

But that is beside the point
battery dawn nights blending themselves

and not falling at all
talking into pheasants bending themselves

What would I feel without that goal
talking into percents bending themselves

like flattening sleep 
walking into percents blending themselves

in the sense of watching
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

burrowed about from repeated travels
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

I assumed what I draw
battery dawn nights ending themselves

radiating from housing
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

I answered what I thought
where rights ended themselves

stopped light with validated fields
