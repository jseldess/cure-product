('at', 'through')

But that is beside the point
You can hear it also through your leisure

But I can’t let myself treat 
Back up through the results

That’s when they really take
back up through results

To that impossible place
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

What was the last time
I cannot clear it also through investiture

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Can I clear it through emphatic seizure
You can clear it also through static seizure

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure

You can clear it also through static siezure
You can hear it also through static leisure

You can clear it also through static leisure
I get through there

in the sense of watching
I get from here through there

I watch a movie
in traversing get through there

I resume attributable visions
get from here through there

attributable visions
I get here through there

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
