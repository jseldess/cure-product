('at', 'time.')

But that is beside the point
Where I sleep at times

into rotating directionless 
Then I constellate my time family country

variegated reflected light
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
only fragments of time with my children

and at my desk
at any time it can drift again

I let myself treat
over the long time up in the sky

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
That’s where I sleep at times

But I can’t let myself treat 
So I constellate the time family country

and not falling at all
on the time line I was on

executive breath
over the time line I was on

by no ventillation my purpose
 and time in the train

and my heart rate
I spend time online learning to code

dislocated and a person from a distance
On the timeline I was on

I am told ventillation
over the long time I was on

I am told by no ventillation
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

What the next step
The long time I had a vision

What would I feel without that goal
without the long time I was accounting

What I do in my liesure
The long time I was a vision

flattening my reception
which is the long time I was on

like flattening sleep 
without the long time I was on accounting

battery dawn nights blending themselves
the long time I was on

I resume attributable visions
in the long time they were on

that having been after content
or alter of course the time anyway

between that day
formerly a long time they were on
