('at', 'tire')

But that is beside the point
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating visions
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

when watching tv
The entire company

aspirating with visions
Since I had to hold the entire company

My associations
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

I invited most of what came next
until I could not tire 

What was the last time
until I could not be tired

I need an explicit statement
for to tire as far back as my history

while wrapped in explicit static
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

here is the site of the battle of maldon
