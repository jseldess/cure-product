('at', 'told')

But that is beside the point
I told her a story, she drew waves.

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
I am told ventillation

executive breath
I am told by no ventillation

by no ventillation my purpose
I am told by the ventillation

So I am told by the ventillation
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

The ventillation rushes on
which ran to be told

latency which doesn’t mean anything
