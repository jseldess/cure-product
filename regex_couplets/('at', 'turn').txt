('at', 'turn')

But that is beside the point
in a sharp downward turn 

where I sleep at times
In a sharp downard turn

and not falling at all
sudden downward turn

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I keep turning back again myself

and my heart rate
I keep turning back

Thatâ€™s when they really take
who knows how to turn it off

The way that I was going
Bach helps turn it off

battery dawn nights 
I turn not sad exactly

stopped light with validated fields
I return not sad exactly

to return what I bought
I returned not sad exactly

I learned my location
I returned to location

at the site of a purchase
I returned

that having been after content
