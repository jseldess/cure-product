('at', 'until')

But that is beside the point
until my purpose up in the sky

I am told by no ventillation
until I could not tire 

What was the last time
until I could not be tired

I need an explicit statement
until I could not be hired

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
until I purpose up in the sky

Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going
until I purchase up the sky

And from that great distance
until I purchase the sky

to catch the spots
until I purchase up in the sky

And from a great distance
until the bill came

That I captured an afterimage
until a happier time found

uses for the attention of the brand
