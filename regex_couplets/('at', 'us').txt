('at', 'us')

But that is beside the point
Ask who I am to suspend

Where I sleep at times
I suspend live connections to you

into rotating directionless 
Suspended live in connections to you

at home brought into privacy
asynchronous 

variegated reflected light
because it was really dark

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

That’s exaclty what I want for them
They’re just not mine

Put in place as stationary destinations
russling to stay still

into rotating and directionless space
slow asynchronous

attempted anachronism
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I let myself treat
I want to cite a poem so usual

the latter
was not just a defeat

and my heart rate
In a vertiginous dream

Where official policy is to catch and release
in a continuous vertiginous dream

of later results
You use the most essential parts

That’s when they really take
In a continuous theme

hold at intervals riding forward
Remnant continuous pages

at intervals while riding forward
The ventillation rushes on

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
I just got a letter

What the next step
So stay with us

aspirating with little visions
but it continued rippling muscle

That company creates a life
I reuse unassimilable visions

What would I feel without that goal
because there was no solid ground to continue along

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I reuse indelible tracks 

What I do in my liesure
I refuse indelible tracts

all that I can think I want
I refuse indelible contracts

explicit statements
it was not just a defeat

though it was most emphatically that
I have them trust in me

that having been after content
a futile joyous white sun

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Articles all around us

of those gathered
I wear suspenders

And from that great distance
I used my technology

that hold and wish to hold
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

here is the site of the battle of maldon
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

that of the man with the dyed blond hair
in the form filled offered in trust

The trackers on users

I send and retrieve aside the impuse

and found inundated
useless for not having paid

uses for the attention of the brand
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

in the space that it had
about the sight hosting trusting

so still watch them
in the form filled offered trust

stopped light with validated fields
in the form filled offered must

In what part did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

the way was water
radiating from housing

and persisting and replicating
shone from the housing

my standing in data
