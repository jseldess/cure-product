('at', 'use')

But that is beside the point
because it was really dark

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
You use the most essential parts

That’s when they really take
I reuse unassimilable visions

What would I feel without that goal
because there was no solid ground to continue along

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I reuse indelible tracks 

What I do in my liesure
I refuse indelible tracts

all that I can think I want
I refuse indelible contracts

explicit statements
I used my technology

And from that great distance
trackers collecting data on users

data collection on users
The trackers on users

More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

and found inundated
useless for not having paid

uses for the attention of the brand
