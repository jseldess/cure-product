('at', 'versing')

But that is beside the point
in traversing my purchase

What I do in my liesure
though as for conversing

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
of my purpose in versing

in the sense of watching
in traversing my purpose

that having been after content
in traversing my circuit

that will spur me on
in conversing of my purpose

that will try me on 
of my purpose in conversing

I watch a movie
in traversing get through there

I resume attributable visions
versing my circuit

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
