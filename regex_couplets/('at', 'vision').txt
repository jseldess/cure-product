('at', 'vision')

But that is beside the point
I had me a vision

I am told ventillation
The planning process for visions

What the next step
The planning process is for visionaries only

and strategies not tactics
aspirating visions

into the well controlled climate
aspirating with visions

My associations
embodied with little visions

I invited most of what came next
little visions

The days of private data
aspirating with little visions

I aspirate with little vision
I reuse unassimilable visions

What would I feel without that goal
there wasn’t any television 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I resume unassimilable visions

What I do in my liesure
The long time I had a vision

that I can hear
up in the television pleasure

What was the last time
up in the television

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
there was no television to hear

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I resume attributable visions

You can hear it also through static leisure
The long time I was a vision

flattening my reception
I had a vision

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
attributable visions

attributable decisions
visions that can be attributable

that can be attributable
of attributable visions

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

here is the site of the battle of maldon
joined in my television

my interfaced stand data
visions that can be attainable

revisions that can be attributable
at home visions can be attainable

that this is possible
