('at', 'visions')

But that is beside the point
The planning process for visions

What the next step
aspirating visions

into the well controlled climate
aspirating with visions

My associations
embodied with little visions

I invited most of what came next
little visions

The days of private data
aspirating with little visions

I aspirate with little vision
I reuse unassimilable visions

What would I feel without that goal
I resume unassimilable visions

What I do in my liesure
I resume attributable visions

You can hear it also through static leisure
attributable visions

attributable decisions
visions that can be attributable

that can be attributable
of attributable visions

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
visions that can be attainable

revisions that can be attributable
at home visions can be attainable

that this is possible
