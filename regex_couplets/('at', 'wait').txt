('at', 'wait')

But that is beside the point
There are spots waiting

And from a great distance
Though we are waiting for her

between that day
not needing to wait

burrowed about from repeated travels
Though we are waiting 

I designated 
Though we can’t help waiting

The way that I was going
Though we can’t help waiting for her

battery dawn nights 
waiting out front or up above 

I learned my location
