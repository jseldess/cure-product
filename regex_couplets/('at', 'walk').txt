('at', 'walk')

But that is beside the point
Before we walk across the wide field

variegated reflected light
Before we walk across the wide opening

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

conversations with our reactions
Before anyone walks across the opening

That’s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field

and at my desk
there was no walking along the pleasure

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I walk up and don’t work anymore

it was not just a defeat
walking into percents blending themselves

battery dawn nights blending themselves
