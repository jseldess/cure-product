('at', 'want')

But that is beside the point
When I want something

I reach repeated expressions first
I want to find a way to block it incoming

I propogated repeated expressions first
I want to find a way to block it

skin smile repeated expressions
I want to find a way to block incoming

smile testing glance repeated expressions
That’s exaclty what I want for them

and at my desk
I want but not to impart cynicism

But I can’t let myself treat 
I want to cite a poem so usual

the latter
I want to cite a poem

attesting this is a chance
all that I can think I want

What I do in my liesure
