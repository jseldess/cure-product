('at', 'watching')

But that is beside the point
when watching tv

that their economic value 
in the sense of watching

I watch a movie
always watching

I resume attributable visions
When I'm watching my tv 

and that man comes on to tell me 
where Iâ€™m watching my tv

for the duration of the universe
