('at', 'were')

But that is beside the point
When we had jobs that were to earn

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
my desires were open

of later pages
I wish my desires were open

Thatâ€™s when they really take
I argued the days were longer

that their economic value 
I agrued the days were longer

when watching tv
The days were long

I argued that the days were longer
The days were long aligned

The days of private data
they were on

I resume attributable visions
in the long time they were on

that having been after content
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

here is the site of the battle of maldon
formerly a long time they were on

if that has anything
answered about 

from cables reheated travels
by the sight of the hosting answered about

so still watch them
I answered about

stopped light with validated fields
washed I answered about

In what part did I lose trust
formerly along time they were on

that is by possessed
I answered what I thought

I assumed what I draw
I answered while interfaced

battery dawn nights ending themselves
They were filters

I answered what I thought about
time they were on

That are my right to say
that they were visible

decisions that can be attributable
that they were divisible

revisions that can be attributable
I assumed that they were divisible

in that I cannot remember
