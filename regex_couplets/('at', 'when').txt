('at', 'When')

But that is beside the point
When I woke up in the morning

too sunny to eat ice cream
When I want something

I reach repeated expressions first
When we had jobs that were to earn

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
When they really take hold of my finger

Thatâ€™s when they really take
When closed to my knowing

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
When I'm watching my tv 

and that man comes on to tell me
