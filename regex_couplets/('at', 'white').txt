('at', 'white')

But that is beside the point
white spots on a black surface

What I do in my liesure
black spots on a white surface

What was the last time
a futile joyous white sun

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

that of the man with the dyed blond hair
