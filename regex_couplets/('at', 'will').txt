('at', 'will')

But that is beside the point
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

and at my desk
On a day there will be direction

Put in place as stationary destinations
will not be the same

that I can hear
that will spur me on

that will try me on 
would only willingly break

and latently from constituents
would only speak willingly

with latency from constituents
would speak willingly 

only with the latency 
would speak willingly only

with the latency last night
would only willingly speak

with a latency last night
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

I designated 
my daughter will learn 

that is by possessed
