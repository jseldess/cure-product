('at', 'world')

But that is beside the point
off the edge of the world

variegated reflected light
Which can be pronounced to the world

So I constellate the time family country
The world 

the latter
off the end of the world

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
hauling off the end of the world

all that I can think I want
falling off the end of the world

I even know what I would find
the opinions in my world

latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything
