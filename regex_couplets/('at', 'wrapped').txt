('at', 'wrapped')

But that is beside the point
wrapped in static and explicit statements

What was the last time
wrapped in static implicit statements

I need an explicit statement
wrapped in static

I resume attributable visions
while wrapped in static

What I do in my liesure
while wrapped in explicit static

flattening my reception
while weâ€™re wrapped in static

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
