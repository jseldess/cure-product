But that is beside the point
Though how can you know without direction

into rotating and directionless space
for how can you know without direction

not even rotating
You can hear it also through your leisure

But I can’t let myself treat 
bring your child along

What does it mean to drift
if you have providence to excess

the latter
If you have confidence regardless all else

was not just a defeat
May I have your zip code

and my heart rate
That you can see only the back of

What the next step
your bid to the next highest ranked network

They are called aspirational
since you can imagine movement

I argued that the days were longer
where you can earn more 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
you need history

flattening my reception
a futile joyous white sun

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I tell you my purposes

And from that great distance
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I watch a movie
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

here is the site of the battle of maldon
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

that of the man with the dyed blond hair
This is your voice 

though it was most emphatically that
This is your choice 

attesting this is a chance
This is your chance

trackers collecting data on users
the young ripples inaudibly

state kept owned impression
