('at', 'your')

But that is beside the point
You can hear it also through your leisure

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
bring your child along

What does it mean to drift
May I have your zip code

and my heart rate
your bid to the next highest ranked network

They are called aspirational
This is your voice 

was not just a defeat
This is your choice 

attesting this is a chance
This is your chance
