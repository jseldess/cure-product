('attributable', 'while')

I resume attributable visions
while wrapped in static

attributable visions
while consuming damage

that decisions can be attributable
I answered while interfaced

decisions that can be attributable
for a while to listen already

revisions that can be attributable
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
