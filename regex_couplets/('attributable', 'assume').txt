('attributable', 'assume')

I resume attributable visions
I assumed 

that decisions can be attributable
I assumed what I draw

decisions that can be attributable
I assume the offers reliable

revisions that can be attributable
I assume the offers revisitable

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
I assumed that they were divisible
