('attributable', 'he')

I resume attributable visions
talking into pheasants bending themselves

attributable visions
I get through there

that decisions can be attributable
the way was water

decisions that can be attributable
phrase them

revisions that can be attributable
The prospects there already

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
I presume to others

in that decisions can be attributable
The sun high enough to strike directly
