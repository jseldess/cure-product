('attributable', 'middle')

I resume attributable visions
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

attributable visions
stopping in the middle

decisions that can be attributable
stepping in the middle

revisions that can be attributable
stepping off into the middle

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
stepping off in to the middle
