('attributable', 'offer')

I resume attributable visions
in the form filled offered in trust

that decisions can be attributable
in track as offer asked 

decisions that can be attributable
I assume the offers reliable

revisions that can be attributable
So I presume the offers already

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
Or can have seen offering possession
