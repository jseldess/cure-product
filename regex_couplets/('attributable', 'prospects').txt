('attributable', 'prospects')

I resume attributable visions
the impulse for my own prospects

that decisions can be attributable
speech that is of by prospects

decisions that can be attributable
The prospects there already

revisions that can be attributable
the prospects being seen by me

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
