('attributable', 'resume')

I resume attributable visions
I continue to presume

attributable visions
I presume to others

that decisions can be attributable
So I presume the offers already

revisions that can be attributable
I presume the offers

decisions that can be attributable
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
