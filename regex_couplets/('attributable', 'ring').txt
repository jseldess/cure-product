('attributable', 'ring')

I resume attributable visions
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

attributable visions
storing in surfeit

that decisions can be attributable
firing and connecting somewhere

decisions that can be attributable
The prospect for veering healthily

revisions that can be attributable
Or can have seen offering possession
