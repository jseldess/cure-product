('attributable', 'up?')

I resume attributable visions
If I take a different measure

attributable visions
attributable decisions

visions that can be attributable
that can be attributable

decisions that can be attributable
I continue to presume

of attributable visions
in traversing my purpose

that decisions can be attributable
converting sight into a purchase

revisions that can be attributable
between bills and stuffed animals

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
I presume to others

in that decisions can be attributable
The sun high enough to strike directly
