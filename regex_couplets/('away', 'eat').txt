('away', 'eat')

drifting away
too sunny to eat ice cream

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I canâ€™t presume to treat others

drifting away needs
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

drifting away from the task
I let myself treat

Who throws contours away
for the creation of the universe
