('away', 'he')

drifting away
Before we walk across the wide field

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I canâ€™t presume to need others

drifting away needs
There are quarterly goals

drifting away from the task
in a moment of drifting away from the task

Who throws contours away
To the ends of my transactions

Formerly away there are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

formerly away
with constant ways to the other end
