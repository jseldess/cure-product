('away', 'here')

drifting away
Of course there is a direction

drifting away needs others presume desires
where I sleep at times

drifting away needs
There are quarterly goals

drifting away from the task
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

Who throws contours away
There are constant ways

Formerly away there are constant ways
There are no constant waves

formerly away
where rights ended themselves
