('away', 'man')

drifting away
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

drifting away needs others presume desires
To my children Walt Whitman

drifting away needs
There are performance reviews

drifting away from the task
not many face up

Who throws contours away
The many transparent pixel calls

Formerly away there are constant ways
