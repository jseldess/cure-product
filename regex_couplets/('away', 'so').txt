('away', 'so')

drifting away
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

drifting away needs others presume desires
reasons resources

drifting away needs
soft paper

drifting away from the task
Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type

Who throws contours away
by in the sound privacy
