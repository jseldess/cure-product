('away', 'time.')

drifting away
Itâ€™s time to wake up, Papa!

drifting away needs others presume desires
at any time it can drift again

drifting away needs
where I sleep at times

drifting away from the task
over the long time up in the sky

Who throws contours away
formerly along time they were on
