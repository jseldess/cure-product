('away', 'up?')

drifting away
asynchronous 

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I canâ€™t presume to need others

drifting away needs
There are quarterly goals

drifting away from the task
sudden downward turn

Who throws contours away
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

Formerly away there are constant ways
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

formerly away
I end up Bach
