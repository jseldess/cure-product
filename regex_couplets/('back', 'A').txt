('back', 'A')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

So I went back to sleep
All of the time

I keep turning back again myself
A turtle fished out of the lake

Out of the back page ruins
A person from a distance

Looking back while I should be sleeping
And as an extension of the values

I see only the back of falling values
ASPIRATING

I see only the back
Aspirational strategy

I can see only the back of falling values
ASPIRATING VISIONS

as far back as my history heard
All that I can think I want

for to tire as far back as my history
COPY DREAM 

I came back to me
As a clone, illegally conceived

decisioned to learn back
CONTRACT
