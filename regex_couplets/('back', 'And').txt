('back', 'And')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
And put in place as though stationary

I keep turning back again myself
And as an extension of the values

I see only the back of falling values
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I came back to me
And we had to say goodbye to her there

decisioned to learn back
