('back', 'As')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
As though stationary and a destination

I keep turning back again myself
Aspirational strategy

I can see only the back of falling values
As an extension of the values

as far back as my history heard
As a clone, illegally conceived

I came back to me
