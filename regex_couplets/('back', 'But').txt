('back', 'but')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

So I went back to sleep
but not impart cynicism

I keep turning back again myself
but the sun isn’t up

I see only the back of falling values
but it continued

as far back as my history heard
but I can hear them

for to tire as far back as my history
I resume attributable visions

I came back to me
attributable visions

decisioned to learn back
that decisions can be attributable
