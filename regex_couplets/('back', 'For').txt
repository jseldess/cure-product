('back', 'For')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I keep turning back again myself
Forecasting the story before dawn

I see only the back of falling values
For an ungraspable time

I came back to me
For Mitt Romney

decisioned to learn back
Formerly a way like this one
