('back', 'I\xe2\x80\x99ll')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I’ll get there eventually

I keep turning back again myself
I’ll get there ruins

Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
I’ll pull myself higher up

I see only the back of falling values
