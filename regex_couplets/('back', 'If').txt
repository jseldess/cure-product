('back', 'if')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
if not directly on my skin

I keep turning back again myself
out of the fifth page ruins

I see only the back of falling values
That company creates a life

as far back as my history heard
If I take a different measure

for to tire as far back as my history
If I take some different measure

I came back to me
if there is anything 

decisioned to learn back
if that has anything
