('back', 'IN')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

I keep turning back again myself
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

I see only the back of falling values
ASPIRATING

I see only the back
ASPIRATING VISIONS

as far back as my history heard
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

I came back to me
By NATASHA SINGER

decisioned to learn back
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
