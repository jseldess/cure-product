('back', 'It')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

So I went back to sleep
It keeps coming down thankfully

I keep turning back again myself
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

I see only the back of falling values
It’s not marshal exactly

decisioned to learn back
