('back', 'On')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
One day there is direction

I keep turning back again myself
On the bandwidth I was on

I keep turning back
On the timeline I was on

I see only the back of falling values
On the other hand

as far back as my history heard
One was up where it should be down

decisioned to learn back
