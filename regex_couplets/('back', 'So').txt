('back', 'so')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

So I went back to sleep
When I want something

I keep turning back again myself
A person from a distance

Looking back while I should be sleeping
or an available resource

I see only the back of falling values
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

as far back as my history heard
If I take some different measure

for to tire as far back as my history
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I came back to me
so that nothing had gravity

decisioned to learn back
so still watch them
