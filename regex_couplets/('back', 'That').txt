('back', 'That')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
That’s exaclty what I want for them

I keep turning back again myself
That’s when they really take

Looking back while I should be sleeping
That you can see only the back of

then I can see only the back values
That can’t be glimpsed

as far back as my history heard
That I captured an afterimage

decisioned to learn back
That are my right to say
