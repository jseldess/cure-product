('back', 'There')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

I keep turning back again myself
There was very little physical activity

as far back as my history heard
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

for to tire as far back as my history
There are spots waiting

decisioned to learn back
There are constant ways
