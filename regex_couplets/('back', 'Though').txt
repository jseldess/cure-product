('back', 'though')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
As though stationary and a destination

I keep turning back again myself
I had nightmares though

as far back as my history heard
though not many freeze up

for to tire as far back as my history
I thought

decisioned to learn back
after though there’s no memory
