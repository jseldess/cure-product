('back', 'To')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
To my children Walt Whitman

I keep turning back again myself
To that impossible place

So I was advised to back up
Tomorrow

I see only the back of falling values
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

for to tire as far back as my history
To neither study

decisioned to learn back
To the ends of transactions
