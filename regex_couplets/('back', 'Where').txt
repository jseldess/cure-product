('back', 'Where')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Where official policy is to catch and release

Out of the back page ruins
Where I put it beating

Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
Where I take my liesure

as far back as my history heard
Where I lead gravity

decisioned to learn back
Where in me did I host
