('back', 'Which')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Which is a measure to never live out

I keep turning back again myself
Which is a pleasure to never live out

for to tire as far back as my history
Which can be called confidence

decisioned to learn back
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
