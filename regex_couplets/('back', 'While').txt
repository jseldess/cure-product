('back', 'while')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Looking back while I should be sleeping

I keep turning back
at intervals while riding forward

not back in the results
while wrapped in static

as far back as my history heard
while wrapped in explicit static

for to tire as far back as my history
while we’re wrapped in static

for as far back as my history
while consuming damage

decisioned to learn back
I answered while interfaced
