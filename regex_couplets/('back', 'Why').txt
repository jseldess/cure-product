('back', 'Why')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

So I went back to sleep
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

I keep turning back again myself
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

I see only the back of falling values
