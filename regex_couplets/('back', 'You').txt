('back', 'You')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
You can hear it also through your leisure

I keep turning back again myself
You use the most essential parts

Looking back while I should be sleeping
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

as far back as my history heard
You can hear it also through static leisure

for to tire as far back as my history
You can have seen offering
