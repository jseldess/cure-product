('back', 'about')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

So I went back to sleep
about my children’s consumption

I keep turning back again myself
burrowed about from repeated travels

decisioned to learn back
and literally moved about
