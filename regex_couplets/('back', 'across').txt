('back', 'across')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Before we walk across the wide field

So I went back to sleep
Before we walk across the wide opening

I keep turning back again myself
across the retinas

as far back as my history heard
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

for to tire as far back as my history
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
