('back', 'act')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

I keep turning back again myself
I was enjoined to act again

So I was advised to back up
I was enjoined to act again myself

I see only the back of falling values
and strategies not tactics

I see only the back
Not goals or tactics

as far back as my history heard
actually considering the end

for to tire as far back as my history
we had inhabited actually

decisioned to learn back
to the ends of my transactions
