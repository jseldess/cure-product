('back', 'along')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
bring your child along

I keep turning back again myself
The days lined along company

as far back as my history heard
formerly along time they were on

decisioned to learn back
formerly along my say to the elections
