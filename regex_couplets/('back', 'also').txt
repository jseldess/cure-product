('back', 'also')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
You can hear it also through your leisure

I keep turning back again myself
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

as far back as my history heard
I cannot clear it also through investiture

for to tire as far back as my history
also didn’t really move

decisioned to learn back
