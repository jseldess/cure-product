('back', 'any')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

So I went back to sleep
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

I keep turning back again myself
Or the company

Looking back while I should be sleeping
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

as far back as my history heard
not many face up

for to tire as far back as my history
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I came back to me
there wasn’t any television 

decisioned to learn back
if there is anything
