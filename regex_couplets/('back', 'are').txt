('back', 'are')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Though there are quarters goals

I keep turning back again myself
barely outlines

I see only the back of falling values
They are called aspirational

as far back as my history heard
I believe I can prepare for it

for to tire as far back as my history
There are spots waiting

decisioned to learn back
Though we are waiting for her
