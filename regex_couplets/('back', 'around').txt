('back', 'around')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Spinning around the heart

Looking back while I should be sleeping
around my country 

for to tire as far back as my history
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I came back to me
Articles all around us

decisioned to learn back
to stand and retrieve and pulse around
