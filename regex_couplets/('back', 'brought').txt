('back', 'brought')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
I brought my head down

I keep turning back again myself
I brought my qualities down

Out of the back page ruins
which I brought down with qualities

I keep turning back
I brought my count down

not back in the results
own stays brought loyal

decisioned to learn back
own that stays brought loyal
