('back', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I can’t fix them without direction

I keep turning back again myself
That can’t be glimpsed

as far back as my history heard
Though we can’t help waiting

decisioned to learn back
I can’t remember them
