('back', 'cannot')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Then I cannot see face value

I keep turning back again myself
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

as far back as my history heard
I cannot clear it also through investiture

for to tire as far back as my history
in that I cannot remember 

decisioned to learn back
