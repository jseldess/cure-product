('back', 'children')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
as pure as my children

So I went back to sleep
on a snow day with my children

I keep turning back again myself
Even the children

I came back to me
my possession of my children

decisioned to learn back
speech my possession of my children
