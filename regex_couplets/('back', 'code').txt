('back', 'code')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
as long as I have access to the code

I keep turning back again myself
I spend time online learning to code

Looking back while I should be sleeping
learned without too much difficulty to code

I see only the back of falling values
falling off the encoded end

as far back as my history heard
encoded off the end

for to tire as far back as my history
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

decisioned to learn back
zipcode
