('back', 'could')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
and could be mapped and weighed

I keep turning back
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

not back in the results
until I could not tire 

as far back as my history heard
until I could not be tired

for to tire as far back as my history
until I could not be hired

for as far back as my history
I could in effect credit

I came back to me
I could consume the dream

decisioned to learn back
and could be inflected with reasons
