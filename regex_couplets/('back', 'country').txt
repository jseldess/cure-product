('back', 'country')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Then I constellate my time family country

I keep turning back again myself
So I constellate the time family country

for to tire as far back as my history
More reasons around my country 

decisioned to learn back
