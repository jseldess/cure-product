('back', 'data')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I’ll pull my data higher up

I keep turning back again myself
I’ll pull my data

I see only the back of falling values
The days of private data

as far back as my history heard
trackers collecting data on users

decisioned to learn back
my interfaced stand data
