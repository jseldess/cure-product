('back', 'dawn')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
battery dawn nights blending themselves

I keep turning back again myself
Forecasting the story before dawn

I see only the back of falling values
dawn already formerly nights 

decisioned to learn back
battery dawn nights
