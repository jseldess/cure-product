('back', 'directly')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
if not directly on my skin

I keep turning back again myself
But not to me directly

Looking back while I should be sleeping
The sun high enough to enter directly 

for to tire as far back as my history
The sun high enough to strike directly
