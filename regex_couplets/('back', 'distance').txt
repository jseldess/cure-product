('back', 'distance')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Falling from this distance

I keep turning back again myself
A person from a distance

Looking back while I should be sleeping
And from a weak distance

I came back to me
And from that great distance

decisioned to learn back
