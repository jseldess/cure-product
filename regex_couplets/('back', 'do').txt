('back', 'do')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

So I went back to sleep
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

I keep turning back again myself
I brought my head down

Out of the back page ruins
the dogs and lillies

Looking back while I should be sleeping
which I brought down with qualities

I keep turning back
I brought my qualities down

not back in the results
I put my bread down

back up through results
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

I see only the back of falling values
What I do in my liesure

as far back as my history heard
I walk up and don’t work anymore

for to tire as far back as my history
here is the site of the battle of maldon

I came back to me
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

decisioned to learn back
latency which doesn’t mean anything
