('back', 'does')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

So I went back to sleep
does not feel an exception

I keep turning back again myself
and it doesn’t take long

decisioned to learn back
latency which doesn’t mean anything
