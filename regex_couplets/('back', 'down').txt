('back', 'down')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
In a sharp downard turn

I keep turning back again myself
I brought my head down

Out of the back page ruins
which I brought down with qualities

I keep turning back
I brought my qualities down

not back in the results
I put my bread down

back up through results
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

decisioned to learn back
