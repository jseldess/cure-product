('back', 'edge')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
I step off the edge

So I went back to sleep
Face falling off the edge of the face

I keep turning back again myself
off the edge of the world

Out of the back page ruins
Falling off the edge of the face

I see only the back of falling values
and testing the edge and gravity

I see only the back
