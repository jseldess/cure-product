('back', 'ending')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
battery dawn nights blending themselves

I keep turning back again myself
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I see only the back
talking into pheasants bending themselves

as far back as my history heard
talking into percents bending themselves

I came back to me
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

decisioned to learn back
battery dawn nights ending themselves
