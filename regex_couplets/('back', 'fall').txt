('back', 'fall')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Then fall then summer from my face

I keep turning back again myself
Then fall then summer

Out of the back page ruins
and not falling at all

I see only the back of falling values
I see the back of falling values

I can see only values falling back
I can see only the back of falling values

then I can see only the back of values
out in the snow fall

I see only the back
out in the snow falling face value

then I can see only the back values
falling off the encoded end

as far back as my history heard
I take it out in the snow fall

for to tire as far back as my history
