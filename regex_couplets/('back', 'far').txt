('back', 'far')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
as far as I can see

I keep turning back again myself
as far back as my history heard

for to tire as far back as my history
for as far back as my history

I came back to me
in welfare and hope

decisioned to learn back
