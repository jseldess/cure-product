('back', 'feel')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
conversations with our feelings

I keep turning back again myself
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I see only the back
I tried to feel the extension of key values

as far back as my history heard
But my not feeling the memory aside

decisioned to learn back
which feels most comfortable
