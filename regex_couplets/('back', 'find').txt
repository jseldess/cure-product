('back', 'find')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
I want to find a way to block it incoming

I keep turning back again myself
Companies increasingly find 

as far back as my history heard
I even know what I would find

for to tire as far back as my history
So I find myself at home

decisioned to learn back
