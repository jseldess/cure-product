('back', 'front')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

I keep turning back again myself
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

Out of the back page ruins
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

I see only the back of falling values
in front of the set afternoon

I see only the back
in front of the set of regulations

as far back as my history heard
And need out in front purchase

I came back to me
behind or out front or up above

decisioned to learn back
