('back', 'get')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I’ll get there eventually

I keep turning back again myself
I’ll get there ruins

Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

I see only the back of falling values
I get through there

I came back to me
in traversing get through there

decisioned to learn back
forgetting decisions
