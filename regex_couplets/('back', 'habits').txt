('back', 'habits')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
I see only the back of my habits

I see the back of the planning process
of the economic value my habits

I see the back of falling values
of the habits they create

I can see only the back of their economic value
The strength of the habits

as far back as my history heard
