('back', 'had')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
If he had not carried one virtue

I keep turning back again myself
I had me a vision

I see only the back of falling values
Since I had to hold the entire company

as far back as my history heard
The long time I had a vision

for to tire as far back as my history
I had a vision

I came back to me
we had to say goodbye

decisioned to learn back
in the space that it had
