('back', 'have')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
I have entered my phone

I keep turning back again myself
If you have confidence regardless all else

for to tire as far back as my history
I have them lost

I came back to me
I have supporters

decisioned to learn back
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
