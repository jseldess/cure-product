('back', 'Having')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I see only the back of falling values
Having been purchased out of you

I came back to me
Having seen more than 

decisioned to learn back
Having seen more than I can remember
