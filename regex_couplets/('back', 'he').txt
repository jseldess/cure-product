('back', 'he')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

So I went back to sleep
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

I keep turning back again myself
Then the sun isn’t up

Out of the back page ruins
low in the content architecture

Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
Where I put it beating

Looking back while I should be sleeping
with my head

I keep turning back
When they really take hold of my finger

not back in the results
While I should sleep not back in the results

back up through results
higher up in the results

So I was advised to back up
rewind before the sun

back up the results
back up through the results

back up before the results
before the sun’s deflections

I see only the back of falling values
blue and sun again a second, then night

I see only the back
upsent in the afternoon

I see the back of the planning process
I see the back of falling values

I can see only values falling back
then I cannot see face value

I see only the back of my habits
of the habits I create

I can see only the back of falling values
What the next step

then I can see only the back of values
out in the snow fall

then I can see only the back values
of the habits they create

I can see only the back of their economic value
Their economic value

That you can see only the back of
out in the snow

as far back as my history heard
What was the last time

for to tire as far back as my history
The long time I had a vision

for as far back as my history
The long time I was a vision

I came back to me
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

decisioned to learn back
speak them of my possessions
