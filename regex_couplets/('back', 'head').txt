('back', 'head')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Without a head

I keep turning back again myself
I brought my head down

Out of the back page ruins
I search with my head

Looking back while I should be sleeping
with my head

I keep turning back
I log in and search with my head

not back in the results
I put my head down

back up through results
into the next level head

as far back as my history heard
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

decisioned to learn back
