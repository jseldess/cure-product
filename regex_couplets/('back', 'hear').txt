('back', 'hear')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
You can hear it also through your leisure

I keep turning back again myself
and my heart rate

Out of the back page ruins
Spinning around the heart

Looking back while I should be sleeping
I hear it between bills and stuff

I see only the back of falling values
I can hear it between bills and stuff

as far back as my history heard
I can hear them between bills and stuff

for to tire as far back as my history
In my heart did I lose trust

decisioned to learn back
