('back', 'heart')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
and my heart rate

I keep turning back again myself
and my heartrate

Out of the back page ruins
Spinning around the heart

Looking back while I should be sleeping
In my heart did I lose trust

decisioned to learn back
