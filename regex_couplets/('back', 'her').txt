('back', 'her')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I told her a story, she drew waves.

So I went back to sleep
Of course there is a direction

I keep turning back again myself
I’ll get there eventually

Out of the back page ruins
Where I put it beating

Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
higher up in the results

So I was advised to back up
I’ll get there ruins

I see only the back of falling values
there was no promotion

as far back as my history heard
Where I take my liesure

for to tire as far back as my history
I get through there

I came back to me
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

decisioned to learn back
Where in me did I host
