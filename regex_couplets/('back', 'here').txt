('back', 'here')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Of course there is a direction

I keep turning back again myself
I’ll get there eventually

Out of the back page ruins
Where I put it beating

Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
I’ll get there ruins

I see only the back of falling values
there was no promotion

as far back as my history heard
Where I take my liesure

for to tire as far back as my history
I get through there

I came back to me
in traversing get through there

decisioned to learn back
Where in me did I host
