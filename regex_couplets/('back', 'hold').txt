('back', 'hold')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
I take hold of my finger

I keep turning back again myself
When they really take hold of my finger

Looking back while I should be sleeping
hold at intervals riding forward

not back in the results
Since I had to hold the entire company

as far back as my history heard
and hold and wish to hold

I came back to me
designed to hold up my underwear

decisioned to learn back
