('back', 'inter')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

So I went back to sleep
interjecting on a day ambition

I keep turning back again myself
hold at intervals riding forward

Looking back while I should be sleeping
at intervals while riding forward

I keep turning back
high up in the internet

I see only the back of falling values
with internally regulated climate

as far back as my history heard
Then I saw them interview

for to tire as far back as my history
my interfaced stand data

decisioned to learn back
