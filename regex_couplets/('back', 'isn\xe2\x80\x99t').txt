The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

So I went back to sleep
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

I keep turning back again myself
Then the sun isn’t up

Out of the back page ruins
Then the sun isn’t available

Looking back while I should be sleeping
but the sun isn’t up

I see only the back of falling values
