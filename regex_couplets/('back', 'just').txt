('back', 'just')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

I keep turning back again myself
I just got a letter

I see only the back of falling values
it was not just a defeat

for to tire as far back as my history
was not just a defeat

decisioned to learn back
