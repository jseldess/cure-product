('back', 'know')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
who knows the way

I keep turning back again myself
I even know what I would find

as far back as my history heard
even when close to my knowing

I came back to me
When closed to my knowing

decisioned to learn back
who knows how to turn it off
