('back', 'learning')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
in light of learning what we see

I keep turning back again myself
I spend time online learning to code

Looking back while I should be sleeping
Then I am learning to code

I see only the back of falling values
phase decision for learning

decisioned to learn back
for learning by the prospect
