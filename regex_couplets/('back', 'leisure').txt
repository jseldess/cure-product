('back', 'leisure')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
You can hear it also through your leisure

I keep turning back again myself
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I see only the back of falling values
You can hear it also through static leisure

as far back as my history heard
