('back', 'light')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
variegated reflected light

So I went back to sleep
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

I keep turning back again myself
stopped light with validated fields

decisioned to learn back
where lights blended themselves
