('back', 'live')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Which is a measure to never live out

I keep turning back again myself
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

as far back as my history heard
Which is a pleasure to never live out

for to tire as far back as my history
where I send and relive aside

decisioned to learn back
where I send and relive
