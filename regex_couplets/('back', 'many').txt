('back', 'many')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
not many face up

as far back as my history heard
though not many facts up in the sky

for to tire as far back as my history
They have very many choices

decisioned to learn back
The many transparent pixel calls
