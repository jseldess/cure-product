('back', 'mine')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
They’re just not mine

I keep turning back again myself
The third letter from the end is mine

I see only the back of falling values
The ads in mine

as far back as my history heard
To the right of determined elections

decisioned to learn back
