('back', 'myself')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
But I can’t let myself treat 

I keep turning back again myself
I was enjoined to act again myself

I see only the back of falling values
off the end myself

as far back as my history heard
myself

decisioned to learn back
the least productive of myself
