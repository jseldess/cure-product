('back', 'night')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

So I went back to sleep
battery dawn nights blending themselves

I keep turning back again myself
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

Out of the back page ruins
blue and sun again a second, then night

I see only the back
I had nightmares though

as far back as my history heard
dawn already formerly nights 

decisioned to learn back
battery dawn nights
