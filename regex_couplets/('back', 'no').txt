('back', 'no')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
asynchronous 

So I went back to sleep
on a snow day with my children

I keep turning back again myself
In a vertiginous dream

Out of the back page ruins
But not to me directly

Looking back while I should be sleeping
in a continuous vertiginous dream

I keep turning back
not back in the results

While I should sleep not back in the results
Then I cannot see face value

back up through results
there was no promotion

I see only the back of falling values
upsent in the afternoon

I see only the back
of my economic value

I see the back of the planning process
an upsent afternoon

I see the back of falling values
out in the snow 

I see only the back of my habits
out in the snow fall

then I can see only the back of values
in front of the set afternoon

I can see only the back of falling values
out in the snow falling face value

then I can see only the back values
I can see only the back of their economic value

That you can see only the back of
increasingly that their economic value

as far back as my history heard
I take it out in the snow fall

for to tire as far back as my history
until I could not be tired

for as far back as my history
until I could not be hired

I came back to me
even when close to my knowing

decisioned to learn back
and it’s not literal
