('back', 'nor')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
into the minority proportion of time

So I went back to sleep
over the long line I would honor

I keep turning back again myself
the simple act of honoring an accountant

as far back as my history heard
nor work in this way daily

decisioned to learn back
