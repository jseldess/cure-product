('back', 'now')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
on a snow day with my children

So I went back to sleep
who knows the way

I keep turning back again myself
Right now I’m the cart

I see only the back of falling values
out in the snow

I see only the back
out in the snow fall

then I can see only the back of values
out in the snow falling face value

then I can see only the back values
I take it out in the snow fall

as far back as my history heard
I even know what I would find

for to tire as far back as my history
even when close to my knowing

I came back to me
When closed to my knowing

decisioned to learn back
who knows how to turn it off
