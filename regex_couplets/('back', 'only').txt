('back', 'only')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
only fragments of time with my children

I keep turning back again myself
So that I notice I am the only one

I see only the back of falling values
I see only the back

I see the back of the planning process
I can see only values falling back

I see the back of falling values
I see only the back of my habits

I can see only the back of falling values
then I can see only the back of values

then I can see only the back values
I can see only the back of their economic value

That you can see only the back of
The planning process is for visionaries only

as far back as my history heard
only in the case

for to tire as far back as my history
would only willingly break

decisioned to learn back
if only on the way to the trash
