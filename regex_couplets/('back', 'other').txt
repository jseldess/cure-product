('back', 'other')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
others desires

I keep turning back again myself
I’ll pull myself another personality type

I see only the back of falling values
On the other hand

as far back as my history heard
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

I came back to me
and other types of tracking technology

decisioned to learn back
I presume to others
