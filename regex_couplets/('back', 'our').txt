('back', 'our')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
conversations with our purchase

I keep turning back again myself
or an available resource

I see only the back of falling values
with four key value pairs

as far back as my history heard
You can hear it also through your leisure

for to tire as far back as my history
or alter of course the time anyway

decisioned to learn back
Who throws contours away
