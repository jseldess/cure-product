('back', 'over')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
I step over the edge

I keep turning back again myself
hovering above standing water

I see only the back of falling values
oddly grown over with historic bark

as far back as my history heard
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

for to tire as far back as my history
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

I came back to me
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

decisioned to learn back
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
