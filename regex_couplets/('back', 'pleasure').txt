('back', 'pleasure')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

So I went back to sleep
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I keep turning back again myself
there was no walking along the pleasure

as far back as my history heard
up in the television pleasure

for to tire as far back as my history
