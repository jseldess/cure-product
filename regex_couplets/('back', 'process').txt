('back', 'process')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
The planning process for visions

I see only the back
I see the back of the planning process

I see the back of falling values
The planning process is for visionaries only

I see only the back of my habits
the planning process for decisions

I can see only the back of falling values
