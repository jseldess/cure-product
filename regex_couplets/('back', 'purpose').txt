('back', 'purpose')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
by no ventillation my purpose

I keep turning back again myself
until my purpose up in the sky

I see only the back of falling values
until I purpose the horizon

I came back to me
In conversing of my purpose

decisioned to learn back
to the other end of my purpose
