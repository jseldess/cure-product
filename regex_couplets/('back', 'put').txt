('back', 'put')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
The edge is put in place

I keep turning back again myself
Where I put it beating

Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
I put my bread down

I keep turning back
I put my head down

not back in the results
