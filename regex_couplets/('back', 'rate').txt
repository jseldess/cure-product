('back', 'rate')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

So I went back to sleep
and my heart rate

I keep turning back again myself
and my heartrate

Out of the back page ruins
Strategy comes before morning

I see only the back of falling values
and strategies not tactics

I see only the back
Aspirational strategy

I can see only the back of falling values
I aspirate with little vision

as far back as my history heard
