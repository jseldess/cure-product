('back', 'really')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
because it was really dark

So I went back to sleep
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

I keep turning back again myself
When they really take hold of my finger

Looking back while I should be sleeping
That’s when they really take

not back in the results
without really agreeing

decisioned to learn back
without really needing
