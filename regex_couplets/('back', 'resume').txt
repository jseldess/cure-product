('back', 'resume')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
and can’t presume to need

I keep turning back again myself
I resume unassimilable visions

as far back as my history heard
I resume indelible tracks

for to tire as far back as my history
I resume attributable visions

I came back to me
I continue to presume

decisioned to learn back
I presume to others
