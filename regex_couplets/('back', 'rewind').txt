('back', 'rewind')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
I was advised to rewind

back up through results
rewind before the sun

back up the results
So I was enjoined to rewind

So I was advised to back up
and came home to rewind inflections

decisioned to learn back
and came home to rewind
