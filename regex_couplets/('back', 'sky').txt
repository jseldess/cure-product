('back', 'sky')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
over the long time up in the sky

I keep turning back again myself
over the long line up in the sky

I see only the back of falling values
though not many facts up in the sky

as far back as my history heard
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

for to tire as far back as my history
Up in the sky

I came back to me
until I purchase up the sky

decisioned to learn back
