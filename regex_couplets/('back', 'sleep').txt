('back', 'sleep')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

So I went back to sleep
where I sleep at times

I keep turning back again myself
While I should be sleeping

Out of the back page ruins
Looking back while I should be sleeping

I keep turning back
While I should sleep not back in the results

back up through results
like flattening sleep 

I came back to me
