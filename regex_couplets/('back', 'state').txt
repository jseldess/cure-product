('back', 'state')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
explicit statements

as far back as my history heard
wrapped in static and explicit statements

for to tire as far back as my history
like state mirror

I came back to me
I swayed a little in my state

decisioned to learn back
