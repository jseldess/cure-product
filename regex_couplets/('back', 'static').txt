('back', 'static')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
wrapped in static and explicit statements

as far back as my history heard
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

for to tire as far back as my history
while wrapped in explicit static

for as far back as my history
