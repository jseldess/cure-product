('back', 'step')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I step off the edge

So I went back to sleep
I step over the edge

I keep turning back again myself
What the next step

I see only the back
What’s the next step

I see only the back of my habits
The next step 

as far back as my history heard
step in by the prospect

decisioned to learn back
phase decision step in
