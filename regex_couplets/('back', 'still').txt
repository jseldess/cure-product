('back', 'still')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

So I went back to sleep
That is itself not still

I keep turning back again myself
I love my daughter still

as far back as my history heard
though we are still breaking in

decisioned to learn back
still wash conserving
