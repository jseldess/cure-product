('back', 'stuff')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
I hear it between bills and stuff

I see only the back of falling values
I can hear it between bills and stuff

as far back as my history heard
I can hear them between bills and stuff

for to tire as far back as my history
between bills and stuffed animals

decisioned to learn back
bills and stuffed animals
