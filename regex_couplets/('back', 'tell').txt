('back', 'tell')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Then I constellate my time family country

I keep turning back again myself
The CEO tells me to embody values

Looking back while I should be sleeping
I had to tell them the news

as far back as my history heard
So I constellate the time family country

for to tire as far back as my history
I tell you my purposes

I came back to me
I tell you the weight of my purchases

decisioned to learn back
and that man comes on to tell me
