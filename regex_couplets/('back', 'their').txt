('back', 'their')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
We can wrestle them with their goals

I keep turning back again myself
I am not allowed to see their face

then I can see only the back values
I can see only the back of their economic value

That you can see only the back of
increasingly that their economic value

as far back as my history heard
without their agreement

decisioned to learn back
to their other end
