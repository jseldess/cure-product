('back', 'themselves')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
battery dawn nights blending themselves

I keep turning back again myself
talking into pheasants bending themselves

as far back as my history heard
talking into percents bending themselves

I came back to me
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

decisioned to learn back
dawn formerly rights ended themselves
