('back', 'through')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
You can hear it also through your leisure

I keep turning back again myself
Back up through the results

Looking back while I should be sleeping
back up through results

So I was advised to back up
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

as far back as my history heard
I cannot clear it also through investiture

for to tire as far back as my history
I get through there

I came back to me
in traversing get through there

decisioned to learn back
