('back', 'tire')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

as far back as my history heard
until I could not tire 

for to tire as far back as my history
until I could not be tired

for as far back as my history
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

decisioned to learn back
