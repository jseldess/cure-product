('back', 'told')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
I told her a story, she drew waves.

So I went back to sleep
I am told ventillation

I keep turning back again myself
I am told by no ventillation

I see only the back of falling values
which ran to be told

decisioned to learn back
