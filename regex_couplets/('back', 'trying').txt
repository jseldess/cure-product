('back', 'trying')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
when trying to feel the extension of key values

as far back as my history heard
that I hear without trying

for to tire as far back as my history
wearing trying talking into it

I came back to me
I spun around trying to touch the spots

decisioned to learn back
