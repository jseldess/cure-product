('back', 'until')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
until my purpose up in the sky

I keep turning back again myself
until I could not tire 

as far back as my history heard
until I could not be tired

for to tire as far back as my history
until I could not be hired

for as far back as my history
until I purpose the horizon

I came back to me
until I purpose up in the sky

decisioned to learn back
