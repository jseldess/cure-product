('back', 'us')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
asynchronous 

So I went back to sleep
because it was really dark

I keep turning back again myself
In a vertiginous dream

Out of the back page ruins
You use the most essential parts

Looking back while I should be sleeping
in a continuous vertiginous dream

I keep turning back
In a continuous theme

not back in the results
Remnant continuous pages

back up through results
The ventillation rushes on

I see only the back of falling values
So stay with us

as far back as my history heard
I reuse indelible tracks

for to tire as far back as my history
I have them trust in me

I came back to me
a futile joyous white sun

decisioned to learn back
in the form filled offered in trust
