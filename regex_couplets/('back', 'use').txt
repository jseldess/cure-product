('back', 'use')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
because it was really dark

So I went back to sleep
You use the most essential parts

Looking back while I should be sleeping
I reuse unassimilable visions

as far back as my history heard
I reuse indelible tracks

for to tire as far back as my history
I used my technology

decisioned to learn back
