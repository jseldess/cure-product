('back', 'value')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
value falling off the edge of the face

I keep turning back again myself
Then I cannot see face value

Out of the back page ruins
The CEO tells me to embody values

Looking back while I should be sleeping
And as an extension of the values

I see only the back of falling values
of my economic value

I see the back of the planning process
I see the back of falling values

I can see only values falling back
I can see only the back of falling values

then I can see only the back of values
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I see only the back
of the economic value my habits

then I can see only the back values
I can see only the back of their economic value

That you can see only the back of
increasingly that their economic value

as far back as my history heard
