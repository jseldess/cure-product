('back', 'values')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
And as an extension of the values

I keep turning back again myself
The CEO tells me to embody values

Looking back while I should be sleeping
I see only the back of falling values

I see only the back
I see the back of falling values

I can see only values falling back
I can see only the back of falling values

then I can see only the back of values
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I see only the back of my habits
then I can see only the back values

I can see only the back of their economic value
I tried to feel the extension of key values

as far back as my history heard
