('back', 'versing')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
in traversing my purchase

as far back as my history heard
though as for conversing

for to tire as far back as my history
of my purpose in versing

I came back to me
in traversing get through there

decisioned to learn back
