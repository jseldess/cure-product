('back', 'visible')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I assumed it was visible

So I went back to sleep
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

I keep turning back again myself
And make myself a visible

I see only the back of falling values
I assume the offers divisible

decisioned to learn back
that they were divisible
