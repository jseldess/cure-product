('back', 'vision')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I had me a vision

I see only the back of falling values
The planning process for visions

I see only the back
The planning process is for visionaries only

I see only the back of my habits
aspirating visions

as far back as my history heard
I resume unassimilable visions

for to tire as far back as my history
The long time I had a vision

for as far back as my history
The long time I was a vision

I came back to me
I resume attributable visions

decisioned to learn back
there wasn’t any television
