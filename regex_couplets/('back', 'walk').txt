('back', 'walk')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Before we walk across the wide field

So I went back to sleep
Before we walk across the wide opening

I keep turning back again myself
there was no walking along the pleasure

as far back as my history heard
I walk up and don’t work anymore

for to tire as far back as my history
walking into percents blending themselves

I came back to me
