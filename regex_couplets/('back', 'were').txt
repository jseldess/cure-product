('back', 'were')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
When we had jobs that were to earn

I keep turning back again myself
my desires were open

Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
I wish my desires were open

I keep turning back
I argued the days were longer

as far back as my history heard
they were on

I came back to me
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

decisioned to learn back
formerly a long time they were on
