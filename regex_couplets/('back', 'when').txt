('back', 'When')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
When I woke up in the morning

So I went back to sleep
When I want something

I keep turning back again myself
When they really take hold of my finger

Looking back while I should be sleeping
When closed to my knowing

I came back to me
When I'm watching my tv 

decisioned to learn back
