('back', 'will')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

I keep turning back again myself
will not be the same

as far back as my history heard
that will spur me on

I came back to me
would only willingly break

decisioned to learn back
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
