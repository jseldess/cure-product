('back', 'work')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

So I went back to sleep
nor work in this way daily

I keep turning back again myself
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I see only the back of falling values
your bid to the next highest ranked network

as far back as my history heard
I need the work

for to tire as far back as my history
nor envy honest work

decisioned to learn back
