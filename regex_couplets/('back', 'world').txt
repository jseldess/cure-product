('back', 'world')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
off the edge of the world

I keep turning back again myself
off the end of the world

as far back as my history heard
falling off the end of the world

for to tire as far back as my history
the opinions in my world

decisioned to learn back
