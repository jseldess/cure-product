('battery', 'up?')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In a sharp downard turn

battery dawn nights 
I end up in Bach

to the other end battery dawn 
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

battery dawn 
Who throws contours away

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
The contours exchange with you

battery dawn nights ending themselves
radiating from housing
