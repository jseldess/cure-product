('been', 'A')

It has been since
And make myself a visible

After having been contented
BREAK

that having been after content
UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON

having been graspable
As a clone, illegally conceived

having been an ungraspable time
COPY DREAM 

having been purchased out
Articles all around us

Having been purchased out of you
And we had to say goodbye to her there
