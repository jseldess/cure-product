('been', 'any')

It has been since
at any time it can drift again

After having been contented
Or the company

that having been after content
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

having been graspable
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

having been an ungraspable time
there wasnâ€™t any television
