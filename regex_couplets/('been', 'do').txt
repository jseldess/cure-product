('been', 'do')

It has been since
in a sharp downward turn 

After having been contented
The dogs and lillies

that having been after content
What I do in my liesure

having been graspable
here is the site of the battle of maldon

having been an ungraspable time
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
