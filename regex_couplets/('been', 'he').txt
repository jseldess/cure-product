('been', 'he')

It has been since
here described

After having been contented
Then the sun isn’t available

that having been after content
Then the sun isn’t up

having been graspable
I get through there

having been an ungraspable time
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

having been purchased out
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

having been purchased out of you
Under the grass principle
