('been', 'over')

It has been since
over the long time up in the sky

After having been contented
hovering above standing water

that having been after content
oddly grown over with historic bark

having been graspable
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

having been an ungraspable time
over the roof of the buildings across the alley
