('been', 'up?')

It has been since
But in more 

After having been contented
Then the sun isn’t available

that having been after content
Then the sun isn’t up

having been graspable
that can be attributable

having been an ungraspable time
I continue to consume

having been purchased out
black spots on a white surface

having been purchased out of you
Articles all around us
