('been', 'us')

It has been since
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

After having been contented
I want to cite a poem so usual

that having been after content
I just got a letter

having been graspable
a futile joyous white sun

having been an ungraspable time
Articles all around us

Having been purchased out of you
I wear suspenders
