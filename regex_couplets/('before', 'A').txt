('before', 'A')

before we can have a retroactive
All of the time

before anyone has walked across the opening
Actually one day there is direction

to be before the sun
After having been contented

Even before the lesson starts
And as an extension of the values

Forecasting the story before dawn
And make myself a visible

before morning goals
THE PLANNING PROCESS

Strategy comes before morning
UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON

Strategy comes before goals
GOALS

before I act on them
All that I own messageable
