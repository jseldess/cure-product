('Before', 'so')

Before we walk across the wide field
reasons resources

Before we walk across the wide opening
When I want something

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Before anyone walks across the opening
You can hear it also through your leisure

Before morning goals
I get up soon and talk in front imaged
