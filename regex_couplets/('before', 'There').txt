('before', 'There')

before we can have a retroactive
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

before anyone has walked across the opening
There are quarterly goals

to be before the sun
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Even before the lesson starts
There was very little physical activity

before I act on them
