('before', 'To')

before we can have a retroactive
To my children Walt Whitman

to be before the sun
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

Even before the lesson starts
To that impossible place

Forecasting the story before dawn
Tomorrow

before morning goals
Toward the start informally given my reasons

before I act on them
