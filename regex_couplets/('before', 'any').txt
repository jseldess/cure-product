('before', 'any')

before we can have a retroactive
Before anyone buys up the opening

before anyone has walked across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the field

to be before the sun
Or the company

Even before the lesson starts
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

before I act on them
