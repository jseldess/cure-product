('Before', 'eat')

Before we walk across the wide field
too sunny to eat ice cream

Before we walk across the wide opening
I reach repeated expressions first

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
I propogated repeated expressions first

Before anyone buys up the opening
skin smile repeated expressions

Before anyone walks across the opening
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

Before morning goals
of the habits I create
