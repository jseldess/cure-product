('before', 'front')

before we can have a retroactive
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

before anyone has walked across the opening
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

to be before the sun
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Its strategy comes before morning goals
in front of the set afternoon

before I act on them
