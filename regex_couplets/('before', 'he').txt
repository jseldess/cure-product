('Before', 'he')

Before we walk across the wide field
I’ll get there eventually

Before we walk across the wide opening
who knows the way

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
In the light of retroactive

Before anyone buys up the opening
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Before anyone walks across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the field
from the incoming stream

Before morning goals
Then the sun isn’t up

Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
but the sun isn’t up
