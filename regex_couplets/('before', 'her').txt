('before', 'her')

before we can have a retroactive
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

before anyone has walked across the opening
One day there is direction

to be before the sun
I’ll get there eventually

Even before the lesson starts
higher up in the results

rewind before the sun
I’ll get there ruins

Forecasting the story before dawn
I’ll pull myself higher up

before morning goals
there was no promotion

before I act on them
The prospects there already
