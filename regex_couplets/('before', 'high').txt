('before', 'high')

before we can have a retroactive
way high up in the inter

to be before the sun
higher up in the results

rewind before the sun
high in the content architecture

Forecasting the story before dawn
Iâ€™ll pull myself higher up

before morning goals
your bid to the next highest ranked network

before I act on them
The sun high enough to strike directly
