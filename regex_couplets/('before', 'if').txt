('before', 'if')

before we can have a retroactive
if not directly on my skin

before anyone has walked across the opening
drifting does not feel an exception

to be before the sun
if you have providence to excess

Even before the lesson starts
out of the fifth page ruins

Forecasting the story before dawn
learned without too much difficulty to code

Strategy comes before morning
That company creates a life

before I act on them
if only on the way to the trash
