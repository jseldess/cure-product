('Before', 'inter')

Before we walk across the wide field
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Before we walk across the wide opening
interjecting on a day ambition

Before anyone walks across the opening
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

Before morning goals
with internally regulated climate
