('Before', 'our')

Before we walk across the wide field
reasons resources

Before we walk across the wide opening
conversations with our purchase

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
conversations with our reactions

Before anyone buys up the opening
Of course there is a direction

Before anyone walks across the opening
You can hear it also through your leisure

Before morning goals
with four key value pairs
