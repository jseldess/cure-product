('before', 'over')

before we can have a retroactive
I step over the edge

to be before the sun
over the long line up in the sky

Even before the lesson starts
hovering above standing water

Forecasting the story before dawn
over the long time up in the sky

before morning goals
oddly grown over with historic bark

before I act on them
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
