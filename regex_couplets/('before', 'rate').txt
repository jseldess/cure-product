('Before', 'rate')

Before we walk across the wide field
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

Before we walk across the wide opening
and my heart rate

Before morning goals
after having been contented Strategy comes before morning

Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
Its strategy comes before morning goals
