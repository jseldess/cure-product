('Before', 'up?')

Before we walk across the wide field
I’ll get there eventually

Before we walk across the wide opening
In a sharp downard turn

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
conversations with our reactions

Before anyone buys up the opening
such as I see

Before anyone walks across the opening
The sun isn’t up 

Before morning goals
Then the sun isn’t up

Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
I get up soon and talk in front imaged
