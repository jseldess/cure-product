('Before', 'walk')

Before we walk across the wide field
Before we walk across the wide opening

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Before anyone walks across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the field

Before morning goals
there was no walking along the pleasure
