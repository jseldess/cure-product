('before', 'want')

before we can have a retroactive
I want to find a way to block it incoming

before anyone has walked across the opening
Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them

to be before the sun
I want to cite a poem so usual

Even before the lesson starts
all that I can think I want

before I act on them
