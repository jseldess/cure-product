('best', 'he')

in need one in that best own
speak them of my possessions

need one in best own
stopping into the prospect

that in need one best own
by in the sound privacy

own best form
I canâ€™t remember them

own best form to ourselves
the people in home form

that agreed one best
that agreed to one the people
