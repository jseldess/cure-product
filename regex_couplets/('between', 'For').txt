('between', 'For')

between bills and stuffed animals
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I hear it between bills and stuff
Forecasting the story before dawn

I can hear it between bills and stuff

between the drug store and the 
Formerly a way like this one

between tracked and buffered
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

careening between the preambles
