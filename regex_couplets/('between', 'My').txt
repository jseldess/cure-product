('between', 'My')

between bills and stuffed animals
My associations

I hear it between bills and stuff
My purpose up in the sky

between that day
My daughter with her way

between tracked and buffered
My say to the elections

between cereal and economic
My interesting politics

tracked between buffered and sizes
