('between', 'so')

between bills and stuffed animals
I’ll pull myself another personality type

I hear it between bills and stuff
or an available resource

I can hear it between bills and stuff
If I take some different measure

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I cannot hear it between bills
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

between that day
I want to cite a poem so usual

between the drug store and the 
firing and connecting somewhere

between tracked and buffered
by in the sound privacy

tracked between buffered and sizes
also didn’t really move

between cereal and economic
buy in the sound privacy

between the private ambles
and could be inflected with reasons
