('between', 'though')

between bills and stuffed animals
As though stationary and a destination

I hear it between bills and stuff
I had nightmares though

I can hear it between bills and stuff
though not many freeze up

I can hear them between bills and stuff
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
though in not many acts up in the sky

between that day
I thought

I have a memory between the day
though it was most emphatically that

between the drug store and the 
after though thereâ€™s no memory

between tracked and buffered
though we are waiting for her

tracked between buffered and sizes
I answered what I thought

between cereal and economic
