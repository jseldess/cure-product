('between', 'To')

between bills and stuffed animals
To my children Walt Whitman

I hear it between bills and stuff

between the drug store and the 
To the ends of transactions

between tracked and buffered
To the ends of my transactions

tracked between buffered and sizes
To the right of determined elections

between the private ambles
