('between', 'Where')

between bills and stuffed animals
Where official policy is to catch and release

I hear it between bills and stuff
Where I take my liesure

I can hear it between bills and stuff
Where I lead gravity

between that day
Where in me did I host

I have a memory between the day
Where I host my purposes

between the drug store and the 
Where in me did I lose

between tracked and buffered
