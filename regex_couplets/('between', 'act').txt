('between', 'act')

between bills and stuffed animals
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

I hear it between bills and stuff
and strategies not tactics

I can hear it between bills and stuff
actually considering the end

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I refuse indelible contracts

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
Though in not many acts

between that day
to the ends of my transactions

I have a memory between the day
We had inhabited actually

between the drug store and the 
The ends of my transactions

between tracked and buffered
to the ends of actions

tracked between buffered and sizes
I turn not sad exactly

between cereal and economic
I return not sad exactly

between the private ambles
before I act on them
