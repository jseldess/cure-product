('between', 'agreed')

between bills and stuffed animals
and to which I’ve agreed

I have a memory between the day
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

between the drug store and the 
and for which the plan agreed

between tracked and buffered
that agreed one of rest

tracked between buffered and sizes
that agreed home

between the private ambles
