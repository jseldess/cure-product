('between', 'already')

between bills and stuffed animals
already formerly a long time

I have a memory between the day
dawn already formerly nights 

between the drug store and the 
with dawn already formerly nights 

between tracked and buffered
So I presume the offers already

tracked between buffered and sizes
The prospects there already

between the private ambles
already brought into privacy

between the preambles
the offers there already

careening between the preambles
