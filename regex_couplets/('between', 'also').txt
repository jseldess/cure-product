('between', 'also')

between bills and stuffed animals
You can hear it also through your leisure

I hear it between bills and stuff
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I cannot clear it also through investiture

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I cannot hear it between bills
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

between that day
also didnâ€™t really move

between cereal and economic
