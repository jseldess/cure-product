('between', 'any')

between bills and stuffed animals
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

I hear it between bills and stuff
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I can hear it between bills and stuff
there wasn’t any television 

I can hear them between bills and stuff
not many face up

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills
Though in not many acts

between that day
Or alter of course the time anyway

I have a memory between the day
They have very many choices

between the drug store and the 
latency which doesn’t mean anything

between tracked and buffered
The many transparent pixel calls

tracked between buffered and sizes
or imagined anyway

between the private ambles
