('between', 'but')

between bills and stuffed animals
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

I hear it between bills and stuff
but the sun isn’t up

I can hear it between bills and stuff
but would I love her the same

I can hear them between bills and stuff
but I can hear them

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
I resume attributable visions

between that day
that decisions can be attributable

between tracked and buffered
but for memory elsewhere

between cereal and economic
decisions that can be attributable

tracked between buffered and sizes
revisions that can be attributable

between the private ambles
but I own all that’s messageable

careening between the preambles
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
