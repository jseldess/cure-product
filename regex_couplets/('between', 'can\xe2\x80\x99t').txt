('between', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

between bills and stuffed animals
I can’t fix them without direction

I hear it between bills and stuff
That can’t be glimpsed

I can hear it between bills and stuff
Though we can’t help waiting

between tracked and buffered
I can’t remember them

tracked between buffered and sizes
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
