('between', 'case')

between bills and stuffed animals
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

I hear it between bills and stuff
only in the case

between that day
I ask say in that case

between tracked and buffered
we ask say in that case

tracked between buffered and sizes
