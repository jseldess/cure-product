('between', 'could')

between bills and stuffed animals
and could be mapped and weighed

I hear it between bills and stuff
until I could not tire 

I can hear them between bills and stuff
until I could not be tired

between that day
And we could inhabit the room easy

I have a memory between the day
and could be inflected with reasons

between tracked and buffered
