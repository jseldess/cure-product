('between', 'daughter')

between bills and stuffed animals
I love my daughter still

I can hear it between bills and stuff
with my daughter

between tracked and buffered
My daughter with her way

tracked between buffered and sizes
my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me

between cereal and economic
my daughter will learn 

between the private ambles
