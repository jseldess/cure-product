('between', 'day')

between bills and stuffed animals
On a snow day with my children

I hear it between bills and stuff
I argued the days felt longer

I can hear it between bills and stuff
The day

between that day
I have a memory between the day

between the drug store and the 
at least most days

between cereal and economic
