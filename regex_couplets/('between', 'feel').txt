I tried to feel the key values extending 

I can hear it between bills and stuff
What would I feel without that goal

I can hear them between bills and stuff
But my not feeling the memory aside

between the drug store and the 
which feels most comfortable

between tracked and buffered
But my not feeling the memory inside

tracked between buffered and sizes
which I feel formerly about for

between cereal and economic
