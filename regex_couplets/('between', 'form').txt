('between', 'form')

between bills and stuffed animals
There are performance reviews

I hear it between bills and stuff
Toward the start informally given my reasons

between that day
already formerly a long time

I have a memory between the day
in the form filled offered in trust

between the drug store and the 
dawn formerly

between tracked and buffered
A way formerly like this one

tracked between buffered and sizes
which I feel formerly about for

between cereal and economic
own best form

between the private ambles
