('between', 'front')

between bills and stuffed animals
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

I hear it between bills and stuff
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

I can hear it between bills and stuff
And need out in front purchase

between that day
behind or out front or up above

between tracked and buffered
