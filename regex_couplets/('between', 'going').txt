('between', 'going')

between bills and stuffed animals
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

I hear it between bills and stuff
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I can hear it between bills and stuff
The way that she is going

between the drug store and the 
The way that I am going

between tracked and buffered
