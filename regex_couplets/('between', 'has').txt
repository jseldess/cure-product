('between', 'has')

between bills and stuffed animals
conversations with our purchase

I hear it between bills and stuff
in traversing my purchase

I can hear it between bills and stuff
purchased out

between that day
if that has anything

I have a memory between the day
I have entered my purchases

between the drug store and the 
phase decisioned by the prospect

between tracked and buffered
converting sight into a purchase

tracked between buffered and sizes
for my own purchases

between cereal and economic
at the site of a purchase

between the private ambles
