('between', 'her')

between bills and stuffed animals
I’ll pull myself another personality type

I hear it between bills and stuff
I’ll pull myself higher up

I can hear it between bills and stuff
but would I love her the same

I can hear them between bills and stuff
Where I take my liesure

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
there was no television to hear

I cannot hear it between bills
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

between that day
Where in me did I host

I have a memory between the day
Where I host my purposes

between the drug store and the 
where I am aside at least

between tracked and buffered
with her waves

tracked between buffered and sizes
By my memory elsewhere

between cereal and economic
my ethereal economic relations

between the private ambles
the prospects there already

between the preambles
the offers there already

careening between the preambles
I presume to others
