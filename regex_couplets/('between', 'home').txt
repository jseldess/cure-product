('between', 'home')

between bills and stuffed animals
promoting from home to a new job

I can hear it between bills and stuff
that agreed home

between tracked and buffered
at home brought into privacy

between the private ambles
So I find myself at home

between the preambles
at home visions can be attainable

careening between the preambles
and came home to rewind inflections
