('between', 'if')

between bills and stuffed animals
drifting away

I hear it between bills and stuff
learned without too much difficulty to code

I can hear it between bills and stuff
If I take a different measure

I can hear them between bills and stuff
If I take some different measure

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
if there is anything 

I have a memory between the day
if you have providence

between the drug store and the 
if that has anything

between tracked and buffered
if only on the way to the trash

between the preambles
