('between', 'know')

between bills and stuffed animals
who knows the way

I hear it between bills and stuff
I even know what I would find

I can hear them between bills and stuff
even when close to my knowing

between that day
knowing the constituents

between tracked and buffered
who knows how to turn it off

tracked between buffered and sizes
that their knowing

between the private ambles
