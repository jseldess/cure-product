('between', 'learn')

between bills and stuffed animals
in light of learning what we see

I hear it between bills and stuff
learned without too much difficulty to code

I can hear it between bills and stuff
decisioned to learn 

between tracked and buffered
decisioned to learn back

tracked between buffered and sizes
I learned my location

between the private ambles
