('between', 'live')

between bills and stuffed animals
Which is a measure to never live out

I hear it between bills and stuff
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

between that day
Which is a pleasure to never live out

between the drug store and the 
where I send and retrieve relive

between tracked and buffered
where I send and relive

between cereal and economic
