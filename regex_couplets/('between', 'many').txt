('between', 'many')

between bills and stuffed animals
not many face up

I can hear them between bills and stuff
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills
Though in not many acts

between that day
They have very many choices

between the drug store and the 
The many transparent pixel calls

between tracked and buffered
