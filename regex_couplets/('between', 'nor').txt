('between', 'nor')

between bills and stuffed animals
into the minority proportion of time

I hear it between bills and stuff
over the long line I would honor

I can hear it between bills and stuff
the simple act of honoring an accountant

between that day
nor work in this way daily

between the drug store and the 
which had on honor to be told

between tracked and buffered
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

tracked between buffered and sizes
