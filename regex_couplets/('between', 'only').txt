('between', 'only')

between bills and stuffed animals
only fragments of time with my children

I hear it between bills and stuff
So that I notice I am the only one

I can hear it between bills and stuff
only in the case

between that day
would only willingly break

between tracked and buffered
if only on the way to the trash

between the preambles
I only think I donâ€™t listen

careening between the preambles
less only money

between the preamble
