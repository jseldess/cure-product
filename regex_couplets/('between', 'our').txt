('between', 'our')

between bills and stuffed animals
reasons resources

I hear it between bills and stuff
or an available resource

I can hear it between bills and stuff
You can hear it also through your leisure

between that day
Or alter of course the time anyway

I have a memory between the day
This is your voice 

between the drug store and the 
Who throws contours away

between tracked and buffered
phrase them of our possessions

tracked between buffered and sizes
