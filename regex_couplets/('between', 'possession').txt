('between', 'possession')

between bills and stuffed animals
I speak to them my possessions

between tracked and buffered
my possession of my children

tracked between buffered and sizes
I speak them of my possessions

between the drug store and the 
I stay the right of my possessions 

between the private ambles
Or can have seen offering possession
