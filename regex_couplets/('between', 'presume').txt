('between', 'presume')

between bills and stuffed animals
and canâ€™t presume to need

I hear it between bills and stuff
I continue to presume

between that day
I presume to others

between tracked and buffered
So I presume the offers already

tracked between buffered and sizes
I presume the offers

between the private ambles
So I presume the offers

careening between the preambles
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
