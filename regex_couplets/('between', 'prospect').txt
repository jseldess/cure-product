('between', 'prospect')

between bills and stuffed animals
the impulse for my own prospects

between the drug store and the 
stopping into the prospect

between tracked and buffered
speech that is of by prospects

tracked between buffered and sizes
the impulse my own prospects

between cereal and economic
The prospects there already

between the private ambles
the prospects being seen by me

between the preambles
The prospect for careening attached

between the preamble
The prospect for veering healthily
