('between', 'prospects')

between bills and stuffed animals
the impulse for my own prospects

between the drug store and the 
speech that is of by prospects

between tracked and buffered
the impulse my own prospects

between cereal and economic
The prospects there already

tracked between buffered and sizes
the prospects being seen by me

between the preambles
