('between', 'purchase')

between bills and stuffed animals
conversations with our purchase

I hear it between bills and stuff
in traversing my purchase

I can hear it between bills and stuff
purchased out

between that day
I have entered my purchases

between the drug store and the 
converting sight into a purchase

between tracked and buffered
for my own purchases

between cereal and economic
at the site of a purchase

tracked between buffered and sizes
