('between', 'really')

between bills and stuffed animals
because it was really dark

I hear it between bills and stuff
without really agreeing

I have a memory between the day
without really speaking

between the drug store and the 
without really branding 

between tracked and buffered
also didnâ€™t really move

between cereal and economic
