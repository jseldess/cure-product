('between', 'stay')

between bills and stuffed animals
wrestling to stay still

I hear it between bills and stuff
So stay with us

I can hear it between bills and stuff
own stays brought loyal

between tracked and buffered
own that stays brought loyal

tracked between buffered and sizes
I stay the right of my elections

between the private ambles
