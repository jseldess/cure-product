('between', 'step')

between bills and stuffed animals
I step off the edge

I hear it between bills and stuff
What the next step

I can hear it between bills and stuff
from which to step off

I can hear them between bills and stuff
step in by the prospect

between tracked and buffered
phase decision step in

tracked between buffered and sizes
step by into the prospect

between the private ambles
stepping in the middle

careening between the preambles
stepping off into the middle
