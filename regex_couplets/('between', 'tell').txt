('between', 'tell')

between bills and stuffed animals
Then I constellate my time family country

I hear it between bills and stuff
I had to tell them the news

I can hear it between bills and stuff
So I constellate the time family country

between that day
and that man comes on to tell me 

between tracked and buffered
