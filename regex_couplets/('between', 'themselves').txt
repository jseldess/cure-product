('between', 'themselves')

between bills and stuffed animals
battery dawn nights blending themselves

I hear it between bills and stuff
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I can hear it between bills and stuff
talking into percents bending themselves

between that day
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

between tracked and buffered
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

tracked between buffered and sizes
battery dawn nights ending themselves

between cereal and economic
