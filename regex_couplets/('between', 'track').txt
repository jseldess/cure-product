('between', 'track')

between bills and stuffed animals
I reuse indelible tracks 

I can hear it between bills and stuff
The first track

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I refuse indelible tracks

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills
and other types of tracking technology

between the drug store and the 
which as tracked befitted 

between tracked and buffered
tracked between buffered and sizes

between cereal and economic
which as tracked befitted phased

between the private ambles
