('between', 'us')

between bills and stuffed animals
asynchronous 

I hear it between bills and stuff
The ventillation rushes on

I can hear it between bills and stuff
I reuse unassimilable visions

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I reuse indelible tracks 

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
I want to cite a poem so usual

between that day
in the form filled offered in trust

I have a memory between the day
was not just a defeat

between the drug store and the 
useless for not having paid

between tracked and buffered
radiating from housing

between cereal and economic
I have them trust in me

tracked between buffered and sizes
