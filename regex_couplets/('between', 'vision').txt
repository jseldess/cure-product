('between', 'vision')

between bills and stuffed animals
I had me a vision

I hear it between bills and stuff
The planning process for visions

I can hear it between bills and stuff
I reuse unassimilable visions

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I resume unassimilable visions

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
there was no television to hear

I cannot hear it between bills
I resume attributable visions

between that day
there wasnâ€™t any television 

between tracked and buffered
joined in my television

between cereal and economic
visions that can be attainable

between the private ambles
revisions that can be attributable

careening between the preambles
