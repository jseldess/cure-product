('between', 'waiting')

between bills and stuffed animals
There are spots waiting

between that day
Though we are waiting for her

I have a memory between the day
Though we are waiting 

between tracked and buffered
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

tracked between buffered and sizes
waiting out front or up above 

between the private ambles
