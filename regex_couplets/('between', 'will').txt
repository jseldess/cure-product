('between', 'will')

between bills and stuffed animals
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

I hear it between bills and stuff
will not be the same

I can hear them between bills and stuff
that will spur me on

between that day
would only willingly break

between tracked and buffered
my daughter will learn 

tracked between buffered and sizes
