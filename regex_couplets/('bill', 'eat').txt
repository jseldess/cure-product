('bill', 'eat')

between bills and stuffed animals
too sunny to eat ice cream

I hear it between bills and stuff
executive breath

I can hear it between bills and stuff
it was not just a defeat

billowing in the cloud
And from that great distance

until the bill came
was not just a defeat

the bill my detuning
