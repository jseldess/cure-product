('bills', 'A')

between bills and stuffed animals
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

I hear it between bills and stuff
And make myself a visible

I can hear it between bills and stuff
All that I can think I want

I can hear them between bills and stuff
A defeated

bills and stuffed animals
All that I own messageable
