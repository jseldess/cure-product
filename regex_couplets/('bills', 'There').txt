('bills', 'There')

between bills and stuffed animals
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

I hear it between bills and stuff
There was very little physical activity

I can hear it between bills and stuff
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

bills and stuffed animals
