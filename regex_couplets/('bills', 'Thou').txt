('bills', 'Thou')

between bills and stuffed animals
Though there are quarters goals

I hear it between bills and stuff
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

I can hear it between bills and stuff
Though in not many acts

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
Though in not many facts

bills and stuffed animals
