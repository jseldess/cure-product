('bills', 'but')

between bills and stuffed animals
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

I hear it between bills and stuff
but the sun isn’t up

I can hear it between bills and stuff
but would I love her the same

I can hear them between bills and stuff
but I can hear them

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
I resume attributable visions

bills and stuffed animals
revisions that can be attributable
