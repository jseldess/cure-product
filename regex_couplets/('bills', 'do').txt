('bills', 'do')

between bills and stuffed animals
in a sharp downward turn 

I hear it between bills and stuff
the dogs and lillies

I can hear it between bills and stuff
What I do in my liesure

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I walk up and don’t work anymore

bills and stuffed animals
I only think I don’t listen
