('bills', 'he')

between bills and stuffed animals
by the private preambles

I hear it between bills and stuff
off the edge of the world

I can hear it between bills and stuff
The ads in mine

I can hear them between bills and stuff
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills
and stuff up in the sky

bills and stuffed animals
I presume the offers
