('bills', 'here')

between bills and stuffed animals
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

I hear it between bills and stuff
there was no promotion

I can hear it between bills and stuff
Where I take my liesure

I can hear them between bills and stuff
there was no television to hear

I cannot hear it between bills
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

bills and stuffed animals
The prospects there already
