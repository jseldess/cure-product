('bills', 'man')

between bills and stuffed animals
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

I hear it between bills and stuff
not many face up

I can hear them between bills and stuff
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills
Though in not many acts

bills and stuffed animals
