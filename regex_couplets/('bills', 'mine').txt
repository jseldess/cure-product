('bills', 'mine')

between bills and stuffed animals
Theyâ€™re just not mine

I hear it between bills and stuff
The third letter from the end is mine

I can hear it between bills and stuff
The ads in mine

I can hear them between bills and stuff
To the right of determined elections

bills and stuffed animals
