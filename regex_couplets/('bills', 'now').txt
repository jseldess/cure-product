('bills', 'now')

between bills and stuffed animals
On a snow day with my children

I hear it between bills and stuff
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

I can hear it between bills and stuff
I take it out in the snow fall

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I even know what I would find

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
even when close to my knowing

bills and stuffed animals
