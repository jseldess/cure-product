('bills', 'though')

between bills and stuffed animals
As though stationary and a destination

I hear it between bills and stuff
I had nightmares though

I can hear it between bills and stuff
though not many freeze up

I can hear them between bills and stuff
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
though in not many acts up in the sky

bills and stuffed animals
