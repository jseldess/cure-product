('bills', 'us')

between bills and stuffed animals
asynchronous 

I hear it between bills and stuff
The ventillation rushes on

I can hear it between bills and stuff
I reuse unassimilable visions

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I reuse indelible tracks 

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
I want to cite a poem so usual

bills and stuffed animals
