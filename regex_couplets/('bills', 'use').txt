('bills', 'use')

between bills and stuffed animals
because it was really dark

I hear it between bills and stuff
I reuse unassimilable visions

I can hear it between bills and stuff
because there was no solid ground to continue along

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I reuse indelible tracks 

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
I used my technology

bills and stuffed animals
