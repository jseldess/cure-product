('black', 'also')

white spots on a black surface
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

black spots on a white surface
I cannot clear it also through investiture

simple black spots
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
You can hear it also through your leisure
