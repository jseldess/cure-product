('black', 'any')

white spots on a black surface
there wasnâ€™t any television 

but they are black spots
not many face up

black spots on a white surface
though not many freeze up

simple black spots
Though in not many acts up in the sky

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
