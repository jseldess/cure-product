('black', 'cannot')

white spots on a black surface
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

black spots on a white surface
I cannot clear it also through investiture

simple black spots
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
in that I cannot remember
