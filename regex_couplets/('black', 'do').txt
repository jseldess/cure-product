('black', 'do')

white spots on a black surface
What I do in my liesure

but they are black spots
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
here is the site of the battle of maldon

black spots on a white surface
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
