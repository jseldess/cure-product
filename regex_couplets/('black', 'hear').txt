('black', 'hear')

white spots on a black surface
I can hear it between bills and stuff

but they are black spots
as far back as my history heard

black spots on a white surface
that I can hear

simple black spots
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
You can hear it also through your leisure
