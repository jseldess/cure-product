('black', 'her')

white spots on a black surface
but would I love her the same

but they are black spots
Where I take my liesure

black spots on a white surface
On the other hand

simple black spots
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
