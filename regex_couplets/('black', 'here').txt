('black', 'here')

white spots on a black surface
Where I take my liesure

but they are black spots
there was no television to hear

simple black spots
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
here is the site of the battle of maldon

black spots on a white surface
And we had to say goodbye to her there
