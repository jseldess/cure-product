('black', 'pleasure')

white spots on a black surface
there was no walking along the pleasure

but they are black spots
up in the television pleasure

simple black spots
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

black spots on a white surface
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
Which is a pleasure to never live out
