('black', 'track')

white spots on a black surface
I reuse indelible tracks 

but they are black spots
The first track

black spots on a white surface
I refuse indelible tracks

simple black spots
in not many tracks up in the sky

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
and other types of tracking technology
