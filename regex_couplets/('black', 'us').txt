('black', 'us')

white spots on a black surface
I reuse unassimilable visions

but they are black spots
I reuse indelible tracks

black spots on a white surface
I refuse indelible tracts

simple black spots
I want to cite a poem so usual

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
Articles all around us
