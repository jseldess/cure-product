('black', 'use')

white spots on a black surface
I reuse unassimilable visions

but they are black spots
I reuse indelible tracks

black spots on a white surface
I refuse indelible tracts

simple black spots
I used my technology

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
trackers collecting data on users
