('black', 'vision')

white spots on a black surface
I reuse unassimilable visions

but they are black spots
I resume unassimilable visions

black spots on a white surface
The long time I had a vision

simple black spots
I resume attributable visions

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
I had me a vision
