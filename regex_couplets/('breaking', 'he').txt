('breaking', 'he')

though we are still breaking in
Though we are waiting for her

though we are breaking in the space that it had
where I send and relive would be held

Though we are breaking 
I stand and retrieve the impulse

without really breaking
they should rise up

breaking from my constituents
I speak to them
