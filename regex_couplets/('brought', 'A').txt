('brought', 'A')

at home brought into privacy
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

I brought my head down
A turtle fished out of the lake

I brought my qualities down
A person from a distance

which I brought down with qualities
And as an extension of the values

own stays brought loyal
CONTRACT

own that stays brought loyal
A baby and a bear

that stays brought loyal
Aligned or not with my interests

already brought into privacy
All that I own messageable
