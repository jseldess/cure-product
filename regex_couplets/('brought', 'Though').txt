('brought', 'though')

at home brought into privacy
As though stationary and a destination

I brought my head down
I had nightmares though

own stays brought loyal
I thought

own that stays brought loyal
though we are waiting for her

that stays brought loyal
I answered what I thought

already brought into privacy
