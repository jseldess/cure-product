('brought', 'To')

at home brought into privacy
To my children Walt Whitman

I brought my head down
To that impossible place

own stays brought loyal
To the ends of transactions

own that stays brought loyal
To the ends of my transactions

that stays brought loyal
To the right of determined elections

already brought into privacy
