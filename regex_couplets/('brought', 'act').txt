('brought', 'act')

at home brought into privacy
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

I brought my head down
I was enjoined to act again

own stays brought loyal
to the ends of my transactions

own that stays brought loyal
to the ends of actions

that stays brought loyal
I turn not sad exactly

already brought into privacy
before I act on them
