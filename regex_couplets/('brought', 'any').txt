('brought', 'any')

at home brought into privacy
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

I brought my head down
Or the company

which I brought down with qualities
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

own stays brought loyal
if there is anything 

own that stays brought loyal
The many transparent pixel calls

that stays brought loyal
or imagined anyway

already brought into privacy
