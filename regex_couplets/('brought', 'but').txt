('brought', 'but')

at home brought into privacy
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

I brought my head down
but the sun isn’t up

own stays brought loyal
that decisions can be attributable

own that stays brought loyal
but for memory elsewhere

already brought into privacy
revisions that can be attributable

brought messageable to you
but I own all that’s messageable
