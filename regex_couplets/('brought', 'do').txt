('brought', 'do')

at home brought into privacy
in a sharp downward turn 

I brought my head down
I brought my qualities down

which I brought down with qualities
I put my bread down

I brought my count down
I put my head down

own stays brought loyal
latency which doesn’t mean anything

own that stays brought loyal
and it doesn’t take long

already brought into privacy
I only think I don’t listen
