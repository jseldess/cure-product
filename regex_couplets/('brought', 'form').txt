('brought', 'form')

at home brought into privacy
There are performance reviews

I brought my head down
Toward the start informally given my reasons

own stays brought loyal
in the form filled offered in trust

own that stays brought loyal
A way formerly like this one

that stays brought loyal
which I feel formerly about for

already brought into privacy
own best form to ourselves

home stays brought loyal
the people in home form

brought messageable to you
