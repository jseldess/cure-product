('brought', 'front')

at home brought into privacy
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

I brought my head down
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

I brought my qualities down
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

own stays brought loyal
behind or out front or up above

already brought into privacy
