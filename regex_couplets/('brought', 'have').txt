('brought', 'have')

at home brought into privacy
I have entered my phone

I brought my head down
If you have confidence regardless all else

own stays brought loyal
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

own that stays brought loyal
I have turned it off

that stays brought loyal
I have them lost

already brought into privacy
I have seen more than I can remember
