('brought', 'he')

at home brought into privacy
The prospects there already

brought messageable to you
by the private preambles

I brought my head down
and my heart rate

I brought my qualities down
Where official policy is to catch and release

which I brought down with qualities
In a continuous theme

I brought my count down
I put my head down

own stays brought loyal
speak them of my possessions

own that stays brought loyal
stopping into the prospect

that stays brought loyal
by in the sound privacy

already brought into privacy
buy in the sound privacy

home stays brought loyal
the people in home form

at home brought into private
The prospect of seeing healthily 

brought messageable into privacy
I resume the offers at home already

brought into privacy
I resume the offers at home
