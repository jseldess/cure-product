('brought', 'head')

at home brought into privacy
Without a head

I brought my head down
with my head

I brought my qualities down
I search with my head

which I brought down with qualities
I put my head down

I brought my count down
I log in and search with my head

own stays brought loyal
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

own that stays brought loyal
