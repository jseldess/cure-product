('brought', 'hear')

at home brought into privacy
You can hear it also through your leisure

I brought my head down
and my heart rate

I brought my qualities down
and my heartrate

which I brought down with qualities
I hear it between bills and stuff

own stays brought loyal
In my heart did I lose trust

own that stays brought loyal
