('brought', 'here')

at home brought into privacy
The prospects there already

brought messageable to you
I’ll get there eventually

I brought my head down
Where official policy is to catch and release

I brought my qualities down
Where I put it beating

which I brought down with qualities
I’ll get there ruins

own stays brought loyal
Where in me did I host

own that stays brought loyal
Is there a baby and a bear

that stays brought loyal
By my memory elsewhere

already brought into privacy
The offers there already

at home brought into private
traffick is there nonetheless
