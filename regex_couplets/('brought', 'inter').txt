('brought', 'inter')

at home brought into privacy
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

I brought my head down
hold at intervals riding forward

which I brought down with qualities
at intervals while riding forward

I brought my qualities down
high up in the internet

own stays brought loyal
my interfaced stand data

already brought into privacy
