('brought', 'learn')

at home brought into privacy
in light of learning what we see

I brought my head down
I spend time online learning to code

which I brought down with qualities
learned without too much difficulty to code

own stays brought loyal
decisioned to learn 

own that stays brought loyal
decisioned to learn back

that stays brought loyal
phase decision for learning

already brought into privacy
for learning by the prospect

brought messageable to you
