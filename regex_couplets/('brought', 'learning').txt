('brought', 'learning')

at home brought into privacy
in light of learning what we see

I brought my head down
I spend time online learning to code

which I brought down with qualities
Then I am learning to code

own stays brought loyal
phase decision for learning

own that stays brought loyal
for learning by the prospect

already brought into privacy
a precision for learning

brought messageable to you
