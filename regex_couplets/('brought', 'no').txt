('brought', 'no')

at home brought into privacy
Then I cannot see face value

I brought my head down
In a vertiginous dream

I brought my qualities down
in a continuous vertiginous dream

which I brought down with qualities
not back in the results

I brought my count down
there was no promotion

own stays brought loyal
and itâ€™s not literal

own that stays brought loyal
But my not feeling the memory inside

that stays brought loyal
who knows the way

already brought into privacy
for a while not to listen
