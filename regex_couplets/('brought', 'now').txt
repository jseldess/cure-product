('brought', 'now')

at home brought into privacy
On a snow day with my children

I brought my head down
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

own stays brought loyal
who knows the way

own that stays brought loyal
who knows how to turn it off

that stays brought loyal
that their knowing

already brought into privacy
