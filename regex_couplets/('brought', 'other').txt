('brought', 'other')

at home brought into privacy
I’ll pull myself another personality type

I brought my head down
On the other hand

own stays brought loyal
I presume to others

own that stays brought loyal
to the other end

that stays brought loyal
Cereal and others’ health

already brought into privacy
I assume possession to others
