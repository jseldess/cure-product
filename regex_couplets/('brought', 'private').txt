('brought', 'private')

at home brought into privacy
by the private preambles

I brought my head down
The days of private data

own stays brought loyal
between the private ambles

already brought into privacy
at home brought into private

brought messageable into privacy
brought into private messageably

brought into privacy
in that all this in private is messageable
