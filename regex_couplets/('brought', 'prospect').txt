('brought', 'prospect')

at home brought into privacy
The prospects there already

brought messageable to you
the impulse for my own prospects

own stays brought loyal
stopping into the prospect

own that stays brought loyal
speech that is of by prospects

that stays brought loyal
decisioned by the prospect

already brought into privacy
step in by the prospect

at home brought into private
The prospect of seeing healthily 

brought messageable into privacy
The prospect for careening attached
