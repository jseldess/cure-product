('brought', 'prospects')

at home brought into privacy
The prospects there already

brought messageable to you
the impulse for my own prospects

own stays brought loyal
speech that is of by prospects

own that stays brought loyal
the impulse my own prospects

already brought into privacy
the prospects being seen by me

at home brought into private
