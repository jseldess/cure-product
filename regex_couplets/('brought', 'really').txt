('brought', 'really')

at home brought into privacy
because it was really dark

I brought my head down
When they really take hold of my finger

which I brought down with qualities
That’s when they really take

I brought my qualities down
without really agreeing

own stays brought loyal
without really needing

own that stays brought loyal
also didn’t really move

already brought into privacy
