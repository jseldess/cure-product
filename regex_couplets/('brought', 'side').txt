('brought', 'side')

at home brought into privacy
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

I brought my head down
aside from the retinas

own stays brought loyal
by the side of the hosting service

own that stays brought loyal
But my not feeling the memory inside

that stays brought loyal
But my not feeling the memory aside

already brought into privacy
