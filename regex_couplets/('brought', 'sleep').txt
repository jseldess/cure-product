('brought', 'sleep')

at home brought into privacy
where I sleep at times

I brought my head down
While I should be sleeping

I brought my qualities down
Looking back while I should be sleeping

which I brought down with qualities
While I should sleep not back in the results

I brought my count down
like flattening sleep 

own stays brought loyal
