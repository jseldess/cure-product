('brought', 'tell')

at home brought into privacy
Then I constellate my time family country

I brought my head down
The CEO tells me to embody values

which I brought down with qualities
I had to tell them the news

own stays brought loyal
and that man comes on to tell me 

own that stays brought loyal
