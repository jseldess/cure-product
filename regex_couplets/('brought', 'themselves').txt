('brought', 'themselves')

at home brought into privacy
battery dawn nights blending themselves

I brought my head down
talking into pheasants bending themselves

own stays brought loyal
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

own that stays brought loyal
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

already brought into privacy
