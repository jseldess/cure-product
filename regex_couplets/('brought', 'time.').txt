('brought', 'time.')

at home brought into privacy
Then I constellate my time family country

I brought my head down
I spend time online learning to code

which I brought down with qualities
On the timeline I was on

own stays brought loyal
formerly a long time they were on

own that stays brought loyal
formerly along time they were on

that stays brought loyal
in the long time they were on

already brought into privacy
