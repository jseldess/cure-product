('brought', 'turn')

at home brought into privacy
in a sharp downward turn 

I brought my head down
I keep turning back again myself

I brought my qualities down
I keep turning back

which I brought down with qualities
who knows how to turn it off

own stays brought loyal
I turn not sad exactly

already brought into privacy
