('brought', 'up?')

at home brought into privacy
already brought into privacy

brought messageable to you
Then I cannot see face value

I brought my head down
I brought my qualities down

which I brought down with qualities
in a continuous vertiginous dream

I brought my count down
I put my head down

own stays brought loyal
own that stays brought loyal

that stays brought loyal
in the form filled offered in trust

home stays brought loyal
ensure to ourselves

at home brought into private
So I presume the offers already

brought messageable into privacy
brought into private messageably

brought into privacy
I resume the offers at home
