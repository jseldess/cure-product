('brought', 'us')

at home brought into privacy
asynchronous 

I brought my head down
In a vertiginous dream

I brought my qualities down
in a continuous vertiginous dream

which I brought down with qualities
In a continuous theme

I brought my count down
Remnant continuous pages

own stays brought loyal
in the form filled offered in trust

own that stays brought loyal
radiating from housing

already brought into privacy
