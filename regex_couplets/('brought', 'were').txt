('brought', 'were')

at home brought into privacy
When we had jobs that were to earn

I brought my head down
my desires were open

which I brought down with qualities
I wish my desires were open

I brought my qualities down
I argued the days were longer

own stays brought loyal
formerly a long time they were on

own that stays brought loyal
I answered what I thought

that stays brought loyal
I answered about

already brought into privacy
that they were divisible
