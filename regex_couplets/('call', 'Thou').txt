('call', 'Thou')

not calling or echoing for once
Though there are quarters goals

though it was most emphatically that
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

Which can be called confidence
Though we are waiting for her

to take the call
Though we are waiting 

The many transparent pixel calls
