('call', 'know.')

not calling or echoing for once
who knows the way

though it was most emphatically that
I even know what I would find

Which can be called confidence
even when close to my knowing

to take the call
knowing the constituents

The many transparent pixel calls
who know the way to their other end

The many transparent pixels call
that their knowing
