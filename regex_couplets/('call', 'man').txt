('call', 'man')

not calling or echoing for once
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

though it was most emphatically that
not many face up

Which can be called confidence
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

to take the call
and that man comes on to tell me 

The many transparent pixel calls
The many transparent pixels call

of the many transparent pixel calls
