('call', 'ring')

not calling or echoing for once
interferring 

though it was most emphatically that
hovering above standing water

They are called aspirational
actually considering the end

Which can be called confidence
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

to take the call
firing and connecting somewhere

The many transparent pixel calls
The prospect for veering healthily
