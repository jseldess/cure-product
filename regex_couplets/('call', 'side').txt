('call', 'side')

not calling or echoing for once
Iâ€™m simply inside

though it was most emphatically that
aside from the retinas

Which can be called confidence
But my not feeling the memory aside

to take the call
where I am aside at least

The many transparent pixel calls
But my not feeling the memory inside

recalling aside
