('came', 'do')

I invited most of what came next
What I do in my liesure

I came back to me
here is the site of the battle of maldon

I came after my past
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

until the bill came
and it doesn’t take long

and came home to rewind inflections
I only think I don’t listen

and came home to rewind
