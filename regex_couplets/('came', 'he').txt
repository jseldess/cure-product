('came', 'he')

I invited most of what came next
that I was the arm of this

I came back to me
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

I came after my past
under the last seen principle

until the bill came
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

and came home to rewind inflections
stopping in the middle

and came home to rewind
before I act on them
