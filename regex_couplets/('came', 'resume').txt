('came', 'resume')

I invited most of what came next
I resume unassimilable visions

I came back to me
I resume attributable visions

I came after my past
I continue to presume

until the bill came
I presume to others

and came home to rewind inflections
So I presume the offers already

and came home to rewind
I presume the offers
