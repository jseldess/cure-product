('came', 'so')

I invited most of what came next
with little reason to move

I came back to me
If I take some different measure

I came after my past
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

until the bill came
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

and came home to rewind inflections
and could be inflected with reasons

and came home to rewind
buy in the sound privacy
