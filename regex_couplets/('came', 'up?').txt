('came', 'up?')

I invited most of what came next
I had nightmares though

I came back to me
I captured an afterimage

I came after my past
under the last seen principle

until the bill came
My means without gravity

and came home to rewind inflections
and could be inflected with reasons

and came home to rewind
decisions that can be attributable
