('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'For')

I can’t fix them without direction
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I can’t presume to need others
Forecasting the story before dawn

That can’t be glimpsed
For an ungraspable time

Though we can’t help waiting
Formerly a way like this one

I can’t remember them
For a while I think I don’t listen

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
