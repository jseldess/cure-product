('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'There')

I can’t fix them without direction
There are quarterly goals

Then I can’t presume to need others
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

That can’t be glimpsed
There was very little physical activity

Though we can’t help waiting
There are constant ways

I can’t remember them
