('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'To')

I can’t fix them without direction
To my children Walt Whitman

and can’t presume to need
To my chidren

Then I can’t presume to need others
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

That can’t be glimpsed
Tomorrow

Though we can’t help waiting
To the ends of my transactions

I can’t remember them
