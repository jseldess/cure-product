('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'while')

I can’t fix them without direction
Looking back while I should be sleeping

That can’t be glimpsed
while wrapped in static

Though we can’t help waiting
I answered while interfaced

I can’t remember them
for a while to listen already

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
