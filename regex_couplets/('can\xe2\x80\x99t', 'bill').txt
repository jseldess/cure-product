('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'bill')

I can’t fix them without direction
I hear it between bills and stuff

That can’t be glimpsed
I can hear it between bills and stuff

Though we can’t help waiting
the bill my detuning 

I can’t remember them
between bills and stuffed animals

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
