('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'child')

I can’t fix them without direction
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

and can’t presume to need
To my children Walt Whitman

Then I can’t presume to need others
even my child

Though we can’t help waiting
my possession of my children

I can’t remember them
speech my possession of my children

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
