('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'desires')

I can’t fix them without direction
others desires

and can’t presume to need
If I let myself see others desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to feed others
Others desires as legitimate

That can’t be glimpsed
