('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'do')

I can’t fix them without direction
does not feel an exception

and can’t presume to need
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I can’t presume to need others
in a sharp downward turn 

But I can’t let myself treat 
The dogs and lillies

That can’t be glimpsed
What I do in my liesure

Though we can’t help waiting
and it doesn’t take long

I can’t remember them
I only think I don’t listen

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
