I can’t fix them without direction
drifting does not feel an exception

and can’t presume to need
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I can’t presume to feed others
drifting away from the task

But I can’t let myself treat
