('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'he')

I can’t fix them without direction
there are quarters 

and can’t presume to need
others desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
If I let myself see others desires

Then I can’t presume to feed others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

But I can’t let myself treat 
In the right sense

But I can’t let myself disregard
Others desires as legitimate

That can’t be glimpsed
in front of the set afternoon

Though we can’t help waiting
The way that I was going

Though we can’t help waiting for her
to the ends of my transactions

I can’t remember them
I have them lost

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
I presume to others
