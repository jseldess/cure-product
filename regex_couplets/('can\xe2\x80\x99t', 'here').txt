I can’t fix them without direction
there are quarters 

and can’t presume to need
where I sleep at times

Then I can’t presume to need others
I’ll get there eventually

Then I can’t presume to feed others
That’s where I sleep at times

But I can’t let myself treat 
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

That can’t be glimpsed
there was no promotion

Though we can’t help waiting
Is there a baby and a bear

I can’t remember them
where the tongue rippled

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
