('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'know.')

I can’t fix them without direction
Though how can you know without direction

and can’t presume to need
I even know what I would find

Though we can’t help waiting
who knows the way

I can’t remember them
that their knowing

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
