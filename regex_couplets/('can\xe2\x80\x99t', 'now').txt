('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'now')

I can’t fix them without direction
Though how can you know without direction

and can’t presume to need
Right now I’m the cart

Then I can’t presume to need others
out in the snow

That can’t be glimpsed
I take it out in the snow fall

Though we can’t help waiting
who knows the way

I can’t remember them
that their knowing

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
