('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'reasons')

I can’t fix them without direction
reasons resources

Then I can’t presume to need others
with reasons

That can’t be glimpsed
with little reasons to aspiration

Though we can’t help waiting
and could be inflected with reasons

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
