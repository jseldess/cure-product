('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'rest')

I can’t fix them without direction
We can wrestle them with their goals

and can’t presume to need
that agreed one of rest

Though we can’t help waiting
Aligned or not with my interests

I can’t remember them
home rest form to ourselves 

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
