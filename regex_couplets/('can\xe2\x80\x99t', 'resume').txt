('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'resume')

I can’t fix them without direction
and can’t presume to need

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

Then I can’t presume to feed others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

But I can’t let myself disregard
I resume unassimilable visions

Though we can’t help waiting
I presume to others

I can’t remember them
So I presume the offers already

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
