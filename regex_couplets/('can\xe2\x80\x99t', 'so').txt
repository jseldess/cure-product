('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'so')

I can’t fix them without direction
You can hear it also through your leisure

and can’t presume to need
reasons resources

Then I can’t presume to need others
I’ll pull myself another personality type

That can’t be glimpsed
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

Though we can’t help waiting
by in the sound privacy

I can’t remember them
buy in the sound privacy

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
and could be inflected with reasons
