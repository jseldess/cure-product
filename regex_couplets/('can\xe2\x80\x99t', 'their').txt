('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'their')

I can’t fix them without direction
We can wrestle them with their goals

and can’t presume to need
I am not allowed to see their face

That can’t be glimpsed
their economic value

Though we can’t help waiting
to their other end

I can’t remember them
that their knowing

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
