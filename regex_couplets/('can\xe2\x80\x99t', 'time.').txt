('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'time.')

I can’t fix them without direction
where I sleep at times

Then I can’t presume to need others
at any time it can drift again

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I constellate my time family country

Then I can’t presume to feed others
That’s where I sleep at times

But I can’t let myself disregard
over the long time up in the sky

That can’t be glimpsed
The long time I had a vision

Though we can’t help waiting
formerly along time they were on

I can’t remember them
in the long time they were on

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
