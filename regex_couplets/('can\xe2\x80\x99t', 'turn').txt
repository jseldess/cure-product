I can’t fix them without direction
in a sharp downward turn 

Then I can’t presume to need others
sudden downward turn

But I can’t let myself treat 
I keep turning back again myself

That can’t be glimpsed
who knows how to turn it off

Though we can’t help waiting
My daughter turns it off too

I can’t remember them
