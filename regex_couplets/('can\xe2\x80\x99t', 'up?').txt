('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'up?')

I can’t fix them without direction
there are quarters 

and can’t presume to need
But I can’t let myself treat 

Then I can’t presume to need others
as an impure product

Then I can’t presume to feed others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

But I can’t let myself disregard
Then I cannot see face value

That can’t be glimpsed
their economic value

Though we can’t help waiting
Though we can’t help waiting for her

I can’t remember them
I have them trust in me

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
I presume to others
