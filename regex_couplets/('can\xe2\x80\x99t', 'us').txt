('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'us')

I can’t fix them without direction
They’re just not mine

and can’t presume to need
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Then I can’t presume to need others
I want to cite a poem so usual

That can’t be glimpsed
So stay with us

Though we can’t help waiting
radiating from housing

I can’t remember them
I have them trust in me

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
