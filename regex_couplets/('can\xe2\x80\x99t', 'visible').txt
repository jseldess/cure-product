('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'visible')

I can’t fix them without direction
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

Then I can’t presume to need others
And make myself a visible

That can’t be glimpsed
I assume the offers divisible

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
I assumed that they were divisible
