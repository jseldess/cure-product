('can\xe2\x80\x99t', 'you.')

I can’t fix them without direction
Though how can you know without direction

and can’t presume to need
bring your child along

Then I can’t presume to need others
You can hear it also through your leisure

That can’t be glimpsed
your bid to the next highest ranked network

Though we can’t help waiting
the young ripples inaudibly

I can’t remember them
