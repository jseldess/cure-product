('cannot', 'Thou')

Then I cannot see face value
Though there are quarters goals

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
Though in not many acts

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
Though in not many facts

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

in that I cannot remember
