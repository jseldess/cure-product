('cannot', 'though')

Then I cannot see face value
As though stationary and a destination

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
though not many freeze up

I cannot clear it also through investiture
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
though as for conversing

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
though in not many acts up in the sky

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
though it is not a simple act

in that I cannot remember
