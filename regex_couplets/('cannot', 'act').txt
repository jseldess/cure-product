('cannot', 'act')

Then I cannot see face value
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
I refuse indelible tracts

I cannot clear it also through investiture
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Though in not many acts

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
though in not many acts up in the sky

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in the simple act of reading

in that I cannot remember 
before I act on them
