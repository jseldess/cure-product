('cannot', 'acts')

Then I cannot see face value
I refuse indelible tracts

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through investiture
Though in not many acts

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
though in not many acts up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
