('cannot', 'he')

Then I cannot see face value
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
What was the last time

I cannot clear it also through investiture
up in the television pleasure

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills
and stuff up in the sky

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in the simple act of reading

in that I cannot remember 
I assume the offers revisitable
