('cannot', 'her')

Then I cannot see face value
Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
On the other hand

I cannot clear it also through investiture
there was no television to hear

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

in that I cannot remember 
The prospects there already
