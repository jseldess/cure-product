('cannot', 'man')

Then I cannot see face value
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
not many face up

I cannot clear it also through investiture
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in not many tracks up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills
Though in not many acts

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
though in not many acts up in the sky

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

in that I cannot remember
