('cannot', 'many')

Then I cannot see face value
not many face up

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through investiture
in not many tracks up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Though in not many acts

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
though in not many acts up in the sky

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
They have very many choices

in that I cannot remember
