('cannot', 'vision')

Then I cannot see face value
I had me a vision

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
up in the television pleasure

I cannot clear it also through investiture
up in the television

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
there was no television to hear

I cannot hear it between bills
I resume attributable visions

in that I cannot remember 
visions that can be attainable
