('child', 'It')

On a snow day with my children
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

as pure as my children
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i

especially in a child
It has been since

even my child
It’s not marshal exactly

my possession of my children
