('child', 'Thou')

On a snow day with my children
Though there are quarters goals

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

even my child
Though we are waiting for her

my possession of my children
Though we can’t help waiting

speech my possession of my children
