('child', 'Why')

On a snow day with my children
Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

as pure as my children
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

even my child
