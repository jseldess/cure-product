('child', 'come')

On a snow day with my children
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i
Strategy comes before morning

even my child
and that man comes on to tell me 

my possession of my children
and come home to remind inflections
