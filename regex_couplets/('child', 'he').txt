('child', 'he')

On a snow day with my children
Before we walk across the wide field

as pure as my children
The dogs and lillies

a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i
When I woke up in the morning

my children’s consumption
Before we walk across the wide opening

about my children’s consumption
Then I cannot see face value

especially in a child
The sun isn’t up 

only fragments of time with my children
Then fall then summer

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
others desires

To my children Walt Whitman
without imparting the cynicism

bearing children along
the drifting is not something special

even my child
Up in the sky

Even the children
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

my possession of my children
I speak them of my possessions

speech my possession of my children
I presume to others
