('child', 'impart')

On a snow day with my children
but not impart cynicism

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
I want but not to impart cynicism

To my children Walt Whitman
But not to impart cynicism

To my children
and imparting cynicism

bring your child along
without imparting the cynicism

bearing children along
