('child', 'know')

On a snow day with my children
who knows the way

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
how can I know without direction

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
I even know what I would find

even my child
knowing the constituents

my possession of my children
who knows how to turn it off

speech my possession of my children
that their knowing
