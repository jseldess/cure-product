('child', 'now')

On a snow day with my children
who knows the way

about my children’s consumption
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

especially in a child
how can I know without direction

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
Right now I’m the cart

even my child
knowing the constituents

my possession of my children
who knows how to turn it off

speech my possession of my children
that their knowing
