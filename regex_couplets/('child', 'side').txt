('child', 'side')

On a snow day with my children
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

as pure as my children
I’m simply inside

especially in a child
aside from the retinas

even my child
But my not feeling the memory aside

my possession of my children
by the side of the hosting service

speech my possession of my children
But my not feeling the memory inside
