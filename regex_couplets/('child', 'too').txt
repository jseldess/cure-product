('child', 'too')

On a snow day with my children
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

as pure as my children
too sunny to eat ice cream

my children’s consumption
emerging this year from too much standing water

even my child
Selma knows too 

my possession of my children
