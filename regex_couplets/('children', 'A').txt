('children', 'A')

On a snow day with my children
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

my childrenâ€™s consumption
All of the time

only fragments of time with my children
Actually one day there is direction

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
And as an extension of the values

Even the children
And need out in front purchase

my possession of my children
CONTRACT

speech my possession of my children
A baby and a bear
