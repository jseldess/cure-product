('children', 'For')

On a snow day with my children
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

To my children Walt Whitman
For whom drifting is not an exception

To my children
For whom 

bearing children along
Forecasting the story before dawn

Even the children
For an ungraspable time

my possession of my children
Formerly a way like this one

speech my possession of my children
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
