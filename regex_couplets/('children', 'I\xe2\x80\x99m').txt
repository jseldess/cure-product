('children', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

On a snow day with my children
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

as pure as my children
I’m simply inside

only fragments of time with my children
Right now I’m the cart

Even the children
where I’m watching my tv

my possession of my children
