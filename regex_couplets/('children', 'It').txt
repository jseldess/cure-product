('children', 'It')

On a snow day with my children
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

as pure as my children
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

my children’s consumption
It keeps coming down thankfully

only fragments of time with my children
It has been since

Even the children
It’s not marshal exactly

my possession of my children
