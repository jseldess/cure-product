('children', 'That')

On a snow day with my children
That’s exaclty what I want for them

only fragments of time with my children
That is itself not still

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
That’s where I sleep at times

Even the children
That I captured an afterimage

my possession of my children
That are my right to say

speech my possession of my children
