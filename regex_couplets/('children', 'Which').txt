('children', 'Which')

On a snow day with my children
Which is a measure to never live out

To my children Walt Whitman
Which can be pronounced to the world

Even the children
Which is a pleasure to never live out

my possession of my children
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

speech my possession of my children
