('children', 'Whitman')

On a snow day with my children
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

my childrenâ€™s consumption
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

as a cure to my children
To my children Walt Whitman

To my children
What Whitman

bearing children along
Walt Whitman drifted

Even the children
