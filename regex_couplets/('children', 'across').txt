('children', 'across')

On a snow day with my children
Before we walk across the wide field

as pure as my children
Before we walk across the wide opening

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

only fragments of time with my children
across the retinas

Even the children
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

my possession of my children
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
