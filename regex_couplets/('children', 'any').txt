('children', 'any')

On a snow day with my children
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

my childrenâ€™s consumption
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

only fragments of time with my children
at any time it can drift again

To my children Walt Whitman
Or the company

Even the children
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

my possession of my children
if there is anything 

speech my possession of my children
The many transparent pixel calls
