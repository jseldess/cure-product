('children', 'blend')

On a snow day with my children
battery dawn nights blending themselves

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
walking into percents blending themselves

Even the children
where I blend and relive

my possession of my children
where lights blended themselves

speech my possession of my children
dawn formerly rights blended themselves
