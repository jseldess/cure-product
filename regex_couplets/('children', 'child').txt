('children', 'child')

On a snow day with my children
as pure as my children

my children’s consumption
about my children’s consumption

only fragments of time with my children
especially in a child

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
as a cure to my children

To my children Walt Whitman
To my children

bearing children along
and bear children along

Even the children
Even my child

my possession of my children
speech my possession of my children
