('children', 'do')

On a snow day with my children
in a sharp downward turn 

as pure as my children
The dogs and lillies

my children’s consumption
In a sharp downard turn

about my children’s consumption
It keeps coming down thankfully

only fragments of time with my children
does not feel an exception

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
drifting does not feel an exception

To my children Walt Whitman
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

To my children
What does it mean to drift

and bear children along
to the down arrow

Even the children
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

my possession of my children
latency which doesn’t mean anything

speech my possession of my children
and it doesn’t take long
