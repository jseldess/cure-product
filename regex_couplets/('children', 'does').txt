('children', 'does')

On a snow day with my children
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

as pure as my children
does not feel an exception

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
drifting does not feel an exception

To my children Walt Whitman
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

To my children
What does it mean to drift

and bear children along
and it doesn’t take long

my possession of my children
latency which doesn’t mean anything

speech my possession of my children
