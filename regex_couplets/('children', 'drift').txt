('children', 'drift')

On a snow day with my children
drifting away

as pure as my children
drifting does not feel an exception

To my children Walt Whitman
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

To my children
What does it mean to drift

and bear children along
the drifting is not something special

Even the children
