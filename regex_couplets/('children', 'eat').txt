('children', 'eat')

On a snow day with my children
too sunny to eat ice cream

my children’s consumption
I reach repeated expressions first

only fragments of time with my children
But I can’t let myself treat 

To my children Walt Whitman
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Even the children
And from that great distance

my possession of my children
for the creation of the universe

speech my possession of my children
