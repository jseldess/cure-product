('children', 'ending')

On a snow day with my children
battery dawn nights blending themselves

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
I tried to feel the key values extending 

Even the children
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

my possession of my children
battery dawn nights ending themselves

speech my possession of my children
