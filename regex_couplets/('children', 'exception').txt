('children', 'exception')

On a snow day with my children
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

my childrenâ€™s consumption
does not feel an exception

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
drifting does not feel an exception

To my children Walt Whitman
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

To my children
