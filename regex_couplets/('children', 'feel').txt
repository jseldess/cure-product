('children', 'feel')

On a snow day with my children
conversations with our feelings

only fragments of time with my children
does not feel an exception

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
drifting does not feel an exception

To my children Walt Whitman
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

To my children
I tried to feel the key values extending 

Even the children
But my not feeling the memory aside

my possession of my children
which feels most comfortable

speech my possession of my children
But my not feeling the memory inside
