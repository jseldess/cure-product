('children', 'field')

On a snow day with my children
Before we walk across the wide field

as pure as my children
stopped light with validated variegated fields

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
Before anyone has walked across the field

only fragments of time with my children
stopped light with validated fields

my possession of my children
