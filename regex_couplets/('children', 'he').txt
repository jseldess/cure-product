('children', 'he')

On a snow day with my children
Before we walk across the wide field

as pure as my children
The dogs and lillies

my children’s consumption
Before we walk across the wide opening

about my children’s consumption
Then I cannot see face value

only fragments of time with my children
Then fall then summer

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
The sun isn’t up

To my children Walt Whitman
others desires

To my children
without imparting the cynicism

bearing children along
the drifting is not something special

Even the children
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

my possession of my children
I speak them of my possessions

speech my possession of my children
I presume to others
