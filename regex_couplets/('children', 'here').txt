('children', 'here')

On a snow day with my children
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

as pure as my children
Of course there is a direction

only fragments of time with my children
on a day there will be direction

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
where I sleep at times

To my children Walt Whitman
There are quarterly goals

Even the children
We had to say goodbye there

my possession of my children
Where in me did I host

speech my possession of my children
Is there a baby and a bear
