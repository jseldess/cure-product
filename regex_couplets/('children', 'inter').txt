('children', 'inter')

On a snow day with my children
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

my childrenâ€™s consumption
interjecting on a day ambition

only fragments of time with my children
interjecting into the stream

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
way high up in the inter

Even the children
Then I saw them interview

my possession of my children
my interfaced stand data

speech my possession of my children
