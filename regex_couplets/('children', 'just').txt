('children', 'just')

On a snow day with my children
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

only fragments of time with my children
Theyâ€™re just not mine

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Even the children
was not just a defeat

my possession of my children
