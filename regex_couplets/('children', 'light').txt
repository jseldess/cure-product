('children', 'light')

On a snow day with my children
variegated reflected light

as pure as my children
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
In the retroactive light

only fragments of time with my children
stopped light with validated fields

my possession of my children
where lights blended themselves

speech my possession of my children
stopped light with validated faces
