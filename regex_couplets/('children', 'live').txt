('children', 'live')

On a snow day with my children
Which is a measure to never live out

To my children Walt Whitman
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Even the children
Which is a pleasure to never live out

my possession of my children
where I send and relive

speech my possession of my children
