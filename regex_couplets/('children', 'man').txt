('children', 'man')

On a snow day with my children
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

my childrenâ€™s consumption
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

as a cure to my children
To my children Walt Whitman

To my children
What Whitman

bearing children along
Walt Whitman drifted

Even the children
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

my possession of my children
and that man comes on to tell me 

speech my possession of my children
The many transparent pixel calls
