('children', 'now')

On a snow day with my children
who knows the way

about my children’s consumption
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
Right now I’m the cart

Even the children
knowing the constituents

my possession of my children
who knows how to turn it off

speech my possession of my children
that their knowing
