('children', 'our')

On a snow day with my children
reasons resources

as pure as my children
conversations with our purchase

only fragments of time with my children
You can hear it also through your leisure

To my children Walt Whitman
bring your child along

bearing children along
Two hours and

Even the children
or alter of course the time anyway

my possession of my children
Who throws contours away

speech my possession of my children
phrase them of our possessions
