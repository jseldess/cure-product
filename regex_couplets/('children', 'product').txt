('children', 'product')

On a snow day with my children
an impure product

as pure as my children
What is an impure product

my childrenâ€™s consumption
as a cure product

To my children Walt Whitman
as a pure product

To my children
as an impure product

Even the children
the least productive of myself

my possession of my children
