('children', 'pure')

On a snow day with my children
an impure product

as pure as my children
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

my childrenâ€™s consumption
What is an impure product

only fragments of time with my children
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

as a cure to my children
as a pure product

To my children Walt Whitman
as an impure product

To my children
