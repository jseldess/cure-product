('children', 'really')

On a snow day with my children
because it was really dark

my children’s consumption
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

only fragments of time with my children
When they really take hold of my finger

Even the children
without really agreeing

my possession of my children
without really needing

speech my possession of my children
also didn’t really move
