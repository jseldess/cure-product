('children', 'side')

On a snow day with my children
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

as pure as my children
I’m simply inside

only fragments of time with my children
aside from the retinas

Even the children
But my not feeling the memory aside

my possession of my children
by the side of the hosting service

speech my possession of my children
But my not feeling the memory inside
