('children', 'so')

On a snow day with my children
reasons resources

as pure as my children
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

my childrenâ€™s consumption
When I want something

only fragments of time with my children
You can hear it also through your leisure

To my children Walt Whitman
who are so fresh and agile

Even the children
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

my possession of my children
so still watch them

speech my possession of my children
by in the sound privacy
