('children', 'step')

On a snow day with my children
I step off the edge

my childrenâ€™s consumption
I step over the edge

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
What the next step

Even the children
step in by the prospect

my possession of my children
phase decision step in

speech my possession of my children
step by into the prospect
