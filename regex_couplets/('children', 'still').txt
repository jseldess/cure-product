('children', 'still')

On a snow day with my children
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

as pure as my children
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

my children’s consumption
That is itself not still

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
I love my daughter still

Even the children
though we are still breaking in

my possession of my children
still wash conserving

speech my possession of my children
