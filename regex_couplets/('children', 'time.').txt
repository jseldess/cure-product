('children', 'time.')

On a snow day with my children
Then I constellate my time family country

as pure as my children
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

my children’s consumption
only fragments of time with my children

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
where I sleep at times

To my children Walt Whitman
over the long time up in the sky

Even the children
or alter of course the time anyway

my possession of my children
formerly a long time they were on

speech my possession of my children
formerly along time they were on
