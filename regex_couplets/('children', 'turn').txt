('children', 'turn')

On a snow day with my children
in a sharp downward turn 

as pure as my children
In a sharp downard turn

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
sudden downward turn

Even the children
who knows how to turn it off

my possession of my children
I turn not sad exactly

speech my possession of my children
