('children', 'up?')

On a snow day with my children
I’ll get there eventually

as pure as my children
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

my children’s consumption
In a sharp downard turn

about my children’s consumption
Then I cannot see face value

only fragments of time with my children
Then fall then summer

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
as a cure to my children

To my children Walt Whitman
slow asynchronous

To my children
But not to impart cynicism

bearing children along
Puffs of air

Even the children
Until my purpose 

my possession of my children
I presume to others

speech my possession of my children
own stays brought loyal
