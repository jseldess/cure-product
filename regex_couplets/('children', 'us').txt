('children', 'us')

On a snow day with my children
asynchronous 

as pure as my children
because it was really dark

my children’s consumption
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

only fragments of time with my children
They’re just not mine

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
slow asynchronous

To my children Walt Whitman
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Even the children
I wear suspenders

my possession of my children
in the form filled offered in trust

speech my possession of my children
radiating from housing
