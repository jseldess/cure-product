('children', 'will')

On a snow day with my children
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

only fragments of time with my children
on a day there will be direction

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
will not be the same

Even the children
would only willingly break

my possession of my children
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

speech my possession of my children
my daughter will learn
