('children', 'you.')

On a snow day with my children
Though how can you know without direction

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
You can hear it also through your leisure

To my children Walt Whitman
bring your child along

bearing children along
if you have providence to excess

Even the children
I tell you my purposes

my possession of my children
the young ripples inaudibly

speech my possession of my children
