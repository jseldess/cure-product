('clear', 'up?')

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
I refuse indelible tracts

I cannot clear it also through investiture
up in the television pleasure

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I resume indelible tracks

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
black spots on a white surface

Can I clear it through emphatic seizure
Between bills and stuffed animals

You can clear it also through static seizure
The simple act opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
You can clear it also through static siezure

You can clear it also through static leisure
I resume attributable visions
