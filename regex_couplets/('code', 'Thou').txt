('code', 'Thou')

as long as I have access to the code
Though there are quarters goals

May I have your zip code
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

falling off the encoded end
Though in not many acts

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
Though we are waiting for her

zipcode
Though we can’t help waiting
