('code', 'bill')

as long as I have access to the code
I hear it between bills and stuff

learned without too much difficulty to code
I can hear it between bills and stuff

falling off the encoded end
I can hear them between bills and stuff

encoded off the end
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
until the bill came

zipcode
the bill my detuning
