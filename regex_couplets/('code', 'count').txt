('code', 'count')

as long as I have access to the code
Then I constellate my time family country

May I have your zip code
I brought my count down

learned without too much difficulty to code
without the long time I was accounting

falling off the encoded end
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
So I constellate the time family country

zipcode
