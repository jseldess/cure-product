('code', 'earn')

as long as I have access to the code
When we had jobs that were to earn

May I have your zip code
I spend time online learning to code

learned without too much difficulty to code
Then I am learning to code

I am learning to code
where you can earn more 

falling off the encoded end
decisioned to learn 

zipcode
decisioned to learn back
