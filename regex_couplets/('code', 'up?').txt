('code', 'up?')

as long as I have access to the code
The sun isnâ€™t up 

May I have your zip code
I would like your zip code

I spend time online learning to code
Spinning around the heart

learned without too much difficulty to code
Having transitioned from leisure to work

Then I am learning to code
The ventillation rushes on

falling off the encoded end
white spots on a black surface

encoded off the end
First language

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I tell you my purposes

Is the weight of my click or zipcode
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I click or my zipcode
One was up where it should be down

zipcode
bought in the surrounded privacy
