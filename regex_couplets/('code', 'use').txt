('code', 'use')

as long as I have access to the code
You use the most essential parts

learned without too much difficulty to code
I reuse unassimilable visions

falling off the encoded end
I reuse indelible tracks

encoded off the end
I refuse indelible tracts

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
trackers collecting data on users

zipcode
