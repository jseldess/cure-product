('come', 'goal')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Though there are quarters goals

Strategy comes before morning
Before morning goals

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

Its strategy comes before morning goals
Strategy comes before goals

and that man comes on to tell me
