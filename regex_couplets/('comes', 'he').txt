('comes', 'he')

Strategy comes before morning
I am the first in the office

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning
Then the sun isn’t up

Its strategy comes before morning goals
but the sun isn’t up

Strategy comes before goals
Then I cannot see face value

and that man comes on to tell me 
– The Rolling Stones
