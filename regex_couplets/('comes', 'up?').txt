('comes', 'up?')

Strategy comes before morning
Then the sun isn’t up

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Its strategy comes before morning goals
but the sun isn’t up

Strategy comes before goals
barely outlines

and that man comes on to tell me 
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
