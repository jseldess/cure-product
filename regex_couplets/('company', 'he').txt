('company', 'he')

Or the company
Spinning around the heart

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I tried to feel the key values extending 

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
there was no promotion

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
I agrued the days were longer

The entire company
off the end myself

Since I had to hold the entire company
The days long aligned

The days aligned for company
The days are long

The days aligned long company
The days lined along company

That company creates a life
And as an extension of the values
