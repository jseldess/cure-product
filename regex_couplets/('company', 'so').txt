('company', 'so')

Or the company
dislocated and a person from a distance

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
My associations

The days aligned for company
with little reason to move

The days aligned long company
with little reason to aspiration

That company creates a life
embodied with little reason
