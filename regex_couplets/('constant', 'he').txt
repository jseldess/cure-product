('constant', 'he')

with constant ways 
to the other end

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
to the other end of actions

who throws a constant way
to the ends of my transactions

There are constant ways
The other end of means

Formerly away there are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

with no constant way
The contours exchange with you

with no constant ways 
who know the ways to their other end

with no constant waves
There are no constant waves

There are no constant ways
The other end of my transactions

with constant ways to the other end
But my not feeling the memory inside
