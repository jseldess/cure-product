('constant', 'up?')

with constant ways 
I end up Bach

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

who throws a constant way
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

with no constant way
The contours exchange with you

with no constant ways 
But my not feeling the memory inside

with no constant waves
and end up in Bach

There are no constant ways
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

There are constant ways
I end up in Bach

with constant ways to the other end
to the other end of my purpose
