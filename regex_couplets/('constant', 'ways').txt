('constant', 'ways')

with constant ways 
with her ways to the ends

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
There are constant ways

Formerly away there are constant ways
with no constant ways 

with no constant waves
There are no constant ways

with constant ways to the other end
deep into pathways from repeated travels
