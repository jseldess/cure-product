('constituents', 'he')

The constituents would be helped
all parties would be helped

The constituents 
Elsewhere my memory

to constituents
they should rise up

the constituents should rise up
The ends of my transactions

breaking from my constituents
I speak to them

from my constituents
only with the latency 

constituents
knowing the constituents
