('continue', 'do')

but it continued
What I do in my liesure

no solid ground to continue along
I walk up and don’t work anymore

I continue to presume
here is the site of the battle of maldon

I continue to consume
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Then I continue to dream then
around the dogs and lillies

I continued to dream then
and it doesn’t take long
