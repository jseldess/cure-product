('continue', 'he')

but it continued
off the end myself

but it continued rippling muscle
And as an extension of the values

no solid ground to continue along
there was no walking along

and continue along having 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

I continue to presume
I get through there

I continue to subsume
I get from here through there

I continue to consume
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

Then I continue to dream then
I could consume the dream

Then I continued to dream then
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

Then I continued to dream
Under the last seen principle

I continued to dream then
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
