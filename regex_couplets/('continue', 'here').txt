('continue', 'here')

but it continued
there was no promotion

but it continued rippling muscle
that potential is there for you

no solid ground to continue along
there was no walking along

and continue along having 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

I continue to presume
I get through there

I continue to subsume
I get from here through there

I continue to consume
And we had to say goodbye to her there

Then I continue to dream then
Where I lead gravity

I continued to dream then
where I need gravity
