('continue', 'so')

but it continued
My associations

but it continued rippling muscle
with little reason to aspiration

no solid ground to continue along
than solid ground

because there was no solid ground to continue along
If I take some different measure

I continue to presume
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

Then I continue to dream then
so that nothing had gravity

I continued to dream then
some sort of a futile joyous white sun
