('continue', 'up?')

but it continued
I argued the days were longer

but it continued rippling muscle
And as an extension of the values

no solid ground to continue along
where you can earn more 

and continue along having 
and support digestion

because there was no solid ground to continue along
walking along the measure

I continue to presume
If I take a different measure

I continue to subsume
I continue to consume

Then I continue to dream then
I could consume the dream

Then I continued to dream then
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

Then I continued to dream
purchased out

I continued to dream then
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
