('continue', 'us')

but it continued
So stay with us

but it continued rippling muscle
I reuse unassimilable visions

no solid ground to continue along
because there was no solid ground to continue along

I continue to presume
a futile joyous white sun

I continue to consume
Articles all around us

Then I continue to dream then
I used my technology

I continued to dream then
I wear suspenders
