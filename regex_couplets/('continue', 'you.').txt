('continue', 'you.')

but it continued
since you can imagine movement

but it continued rippling muscle
where you can earn more 

and continue along having 
You can hear it also through your leisure

I continue to presume
a futile joyous white sun

I continue to consume
I tell you my purposes

Then I continue to dream then
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I continued to dream then
I see you knitting uproars with a bow
