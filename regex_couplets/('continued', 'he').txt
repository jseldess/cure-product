('continued', 'he')

but it continued
off the end myself

but it continued rippling muscle
And as an extension of the values

Then I continued to dream then
I could consume the dream

Then I continued to dream
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I continued to dream then
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
