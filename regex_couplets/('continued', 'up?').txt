('continued', 'up?')

but it continued
I argued the days were longer

but it continued rippling muscle
And as an extension of the values

Then I continued to dream then
I could consume the dream

Then I continued to dream
purchased out

I continued to dream then
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
