('could', 'so')

and could be mapped and weighed
or an available resource

until I could not tire 
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

until I could not be tired
You can hear it also through your leisure

until I could not be hired
If I take some different measure

I could in effect credit
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I could consume the dream
so that nothing had gravity

and we could inhabit the room easy
I want to cite a poem so usual

and could be inflected with reasons
buy in the sound privacy
