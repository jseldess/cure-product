('could', 'Thou')

and could be mapped and weighed
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

until I could not tire 
Though in not many acts

until I could not be tired
Though we are waiting for her

And we could inhabit the room easy
Though we are breaking 

and could be inflected with reasons
