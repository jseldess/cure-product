('could', 'while')

and could be mapped and weighed
Looking back while I should be sleeping

could map to the dimnsions of a graph
at intervals while riding forward

until I could not tire 
while wrapped in static

until I could not be tired
while wrapped in explicit static

until I could not be hired
while consuming damage

I could consume the dream
I answered while interfaced

and could be inflected with reasons
for a while to listen already
