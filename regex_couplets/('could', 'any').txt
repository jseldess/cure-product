('could', 'any')

and could be mapped and weighed
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

until I could not tire 
though not many facts up in the sky

until I could not be tired
I walk up and don’t work anymore

until I could not be hired
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I could consume the dream
there wasn’t any television 

I could in effect credit
without any further damage

and we could inhabit the room easy
or alter of course the time anyway

and could be inflected with reasons
