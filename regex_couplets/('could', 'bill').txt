('could', 'bill')

and could be mapped and weighed
I hear it between bills and stuff

until I could not tire 
I can hear them between bills and stuff

until I could not be tired
billowing in the cloud

I could in effect credit
until the bill came

and we could inhabit the room easy
the bill my detuning 

and could be inflected with reasons
between bills and stuffed animals
