('could', 'but')

and could be mapped and weighed
but the sun isnâ€™t up

until I could not tire 
but I can hear them

until I could not be tired
I resume attributable visions

until I could not be hired
attributable visions

I could consume the dream
that decisions can be attributable

and could be inflected with reasons
decisions that can be attributable
