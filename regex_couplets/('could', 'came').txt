('could', 'came')

and could be mapped and weighed
I invited most of what came next

until I could not tire 
I came back to me

I could consume the dream
I came after my past

I could in effect credit
until the bill came

and we could inhabit the room easy
and came home to rewind inflections

and could be inflected with reasons
and came home to rewind
