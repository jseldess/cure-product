('could', 'count')

and could be mapped and weighed
I brought my count down

could map to the dimnsions of a graph
without the long time I was accounting

until I could not tire 
the simple act of honoring an accountant

until I could not be tired
So I constellate the time family country

until I could not be hired
without the long time I was on accounting

I could in effect credit
More reasons around my country 

and could be inflected with reasons
