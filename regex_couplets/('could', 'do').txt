('could', 'do')

and could be mapped and weighed
the dogs and lillies

could map to the dimnsions of a graph
which I brought down with qualities

until I could not tire 
What I do in my liesure

until I could not be tired
I walk up and don’t work anymore

until I could not be hired
here is the site of the battle of maldon

I could consume the dream
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I could in effect credit
around the dogs and lillies

and we could inhabit the room easy
and it doesn’t take long

and could be inflected with reasons
I only think I don’t listen
