('could', 'eat')

and could be mapped and weighed
executive breath

until I could not tire 
it was not just a defeat

until I could not be tired
And from that great distance

I could consume the dream
And from a great distance

I could in effect credit
was not just a defeat

and could be inflected with reasons
