('could', 'he')

and could be mapped and weighed
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

until I could not tire 
What was the last time

until I could not be tired
as far back as my history heard

until I could not be hired
until I purpose the horizon

I could in effect credit
I get through there

I could consume the dream
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

and we could inhabit the room easy
or alter of course the time anyway

and could be inflected with reasons
stopping in the middle
