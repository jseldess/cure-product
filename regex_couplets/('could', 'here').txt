('could', 'here')

and could be mapped and weighed
I’ll get there eventually

could map to the dimnsions of a graph
I’ll get there ruins

until I could not tire 
there was no television to hear

until I could not be tired
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

until I could not be hired
I get through there

I could in effect credit
I get from here through there

I could consume the dream
And we had to say goodbye to her there

and we could inhabit the room easy
Where in me did I host

and could be inflected with reasons
The prospects there already
