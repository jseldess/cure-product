('could', 'if')

and could be mapped and weighed
out of the fifth page ruins

until I could not tire 
If I take a different measure

until I could not be tired
If I take some different measure

until I could not be hired
if there is anything 

And we could inhabit the room easy
if you have providence

and could be inflected with reasons
if only on the way to the trash
