('could', 'move')

and could be mapped and weighed
since I can imagine movement

until I could not tire 
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

I could consume the dream
and literally moved

And we could inhabit the room easy
myself moved literally as it is

and could be inflected with reasons
