and could be mapped and weighed
or an available resource

until I could not tire 
You can hear it also through your leisure

until I could not be tired

until I could not be hired
or alter of course the time anyway

And we could inhabit the room easy
This is your voice 

and could be inflected with reasons
phrase them of our possessions
