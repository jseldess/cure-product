('could', 'really')

and could be mapped and weighed
When they really take hold of my finger

could map to the dimnsions of a graph
Thatâ€™s when they really take

until I could not tire 
without really agreeing

And we could inhabit the room easy
without really speaking

and could be inflected with reasons
