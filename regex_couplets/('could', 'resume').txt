('could', 'resume')

and could be mapped and weighed
I resume unassimilable visions

until I could not tire 
I resume indelible tracks

until I could not be tired
I resume attributable visions

until I could not be hired
I continue to presume

I could consume the dream
I presume to others

and could be inflected with reasons
So I presume the offers already
