('could', 'ring')

and could be mapped and weighed
hovering above standing water

until I could not tire 
the simple act of honoring an accountant

until I could not be tired
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

I could in effect credit
storing in surfeit

I could consume the dream
firing and connecting somewhere

and could be inflected with reasons
The prospect for veering healthily
