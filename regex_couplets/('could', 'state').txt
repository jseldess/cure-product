('could', 'state')

and could be mapped and weighed
explicit statements

until I could not tire 
wrapped in static and explicit statements

until I could not be tired
I need an explicit statement

until I could not be hired
like state mirror

I could in effect credit
I swayed a little in my state

I could consume the dream
in my state

and could be inflected with reasons
