('could', 'tell')

and could be mapped and weighed
I had to tell them the news

until I could not tire 
So I constellate the time family country

until I could not be tired
I tell you my purposes

I could consume the dream
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I could in effect credit
and that man comes on to tell me 

and could be inflected with reasons
