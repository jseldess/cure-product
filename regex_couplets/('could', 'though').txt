('could', 'though')

and could be mapped and weighed
I had nightmares though

until I could not tire 
though not many facts up in the sky

until I could not be tired
though it was most emphatically that

until I could not be hired
I thought

And we could inhabit the room easy
though we are still breaking in

and could be inflected with reasons
