('could', 'time.')

and could be mapped and weighed
On the timeline I was on

until I could not tire 
The long time I had a vision

until I could not be tired
without the long time I was accounting

until I could not be hired
which is the long time I was on

I could in effect credit
in the long time they were on

I could consume the dream
or alter of course the time anyway

And we could inhabit the room easy
formerly a long time they were on

and could be inflected with reasons
