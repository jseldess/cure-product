('could', 'tire')

and could be mapped and weighed
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

until I could not tire 
until I could not be tired

until I could not be hired
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

and we could inhabit the room easy
