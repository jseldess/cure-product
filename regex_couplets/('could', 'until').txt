('could', 'until')

and could be mapped and weighed
until my purpose up in the sky

until I could not tire 
until I could not be tired

until I could not be hired
until I purpose the horizon

I could in effect credit
until I purpose up in the sky

I could consume the dream
until I purchase up the sky

and we could inhabit the room easy
until a happier time found

and could be inflected with reasons
