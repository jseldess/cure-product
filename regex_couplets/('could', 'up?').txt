and could be mapped and weighed
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

until I could not tire 
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

until I could not be tired
You can hear it also through your leisure

until I could not be hired
until I purpose the horizon

I could in effect credit
I could effect credit

I could consume the dream
I captured an afterimage

and we could inhabit the room easy
or alter of course the time anyway

and could be inflected with reasons
decisions that can be attributable
