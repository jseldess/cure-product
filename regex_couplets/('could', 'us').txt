('could', 'us')

and could be mapped and weighed
in a continuous vertiginous dream

could map to the dimnsions of a graph
Remnant continuous pages

until I could not tire 
I want to cite a poem so usual

until I could not be tired
I have them trust in me

I could consume the dream
Articles all around us

I could in effect credit
I used my technology

and we could inhabit the room easy
in the form filled offered in trust

and could be inflected with reasons
