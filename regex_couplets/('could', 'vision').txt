('could', 'vision')

and could be mapped and weighed
I had me a vision

until I could not tire 
up in the television pleasure

until I could not be tired
I resume attributable visions

until I could not be hired
I had a vision

I could in effect credit
attributable visions

I could consume the dream
there wasnâ€™t any television 

and we could inhabit the room easy
joined in my television

and could be inflected with reasons
visions that can be attainable
