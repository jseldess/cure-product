('could', 'watch')

and could be mapped and weighed
when watching tv

until I could not tire 
in the sense of watching

I could in effect credit
I watch a movie

I could consume the dream
I watch a moving afterimage

and we could inhabit the room easy
When I'm watching my tv 

and could be inflected with reasons
