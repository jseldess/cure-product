and could be mapped and weighed
That you can see only the back of

until I could not tire 
You can hear it also through your leisure

until I could not be tired
If you have confidence regardless all else

until I could not be hired

I could consume the dream
I tell you my purposes

I could in effect credit
I tell you the weight of my purchases

and we could inhabit the room easy
This is your voice 

and could be inflected with reasons
