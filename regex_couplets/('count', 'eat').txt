('count', 'eat')

Then I constellate my time family country
too sunny to eat ice cream

So I constellate the time family country
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I brought my count down
executive breath

without the long time I was accounting
it was not just a defeat

around my country 
And from that great distance

More reasons around my country 
for the creation of the universe
