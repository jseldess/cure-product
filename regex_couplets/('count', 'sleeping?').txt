('count', 'sleeping?')

Then I constellate my time family country
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

So I constellate the time family country
While I should be sleeping

I brought my count down
Looking back while I should be sleeping

without the long time I was accounting
