('count', 'story')

Then I constellate my time family country
I told her a story, she drew waves.

So I constellate the time family country
Forecasting the story before dawn

without the long time I was accounting
as far back as my history heard

the simple act of honoring an accountant
You need history

without the long time I was on accounting
