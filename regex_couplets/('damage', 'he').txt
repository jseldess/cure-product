('damage', 'he')

without ensuing damage
under the last seen principle

while consuming damage
I continued to dream then

without consumer damage
Then I continue to dream then

without longer damage
without any further damage

to any consumer damage
until the bill came

without any longer damage
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
