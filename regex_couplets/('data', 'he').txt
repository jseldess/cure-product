('data', 'he')

I’ll pull my data higher up
higher up in the internet

I’ll pull my data
I’ll pull myself higher up

The days of private data
The days of parsing data

The days of public data
And as an extension of the values

trackers collecting data on users
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

my interfaced stand data
By my memory elsewhere

my standing in data
battery dawn nights ending themselves
