('data', 'us')

I’ll pull my data higher up
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I’ll pull my data
The ventillation rushes on

The days of private data
So stay with us

The days of public data
but it continued rippling muscle

trackers collecting data on users
data collection on users

my interfaced stand data
radiating from housing

my standing in data
I have them trust in me
