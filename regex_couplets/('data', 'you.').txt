('data', 'you.')

I’ll pull my data higher up
You can hear it also through your leisure

I’ll pull my data
That you can see only the back of

The days of private data
since you can imagine movement

The days of public data
where you can earn more 

trackers collecting data on users
the young ripples inaudibly
