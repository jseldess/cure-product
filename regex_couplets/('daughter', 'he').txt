('daughter', 'he')

I love my daughter still
but would I love her the same

with my daughter
the way was water

my daughter will learn 
buy in the surrounded privacy

My daughter with her way
to the ends

My daughter helps too
Though we are waiting for her

my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me
By my memory elsewhere
