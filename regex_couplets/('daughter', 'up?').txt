('daughter', 'up?')

I love my daughter still
but would I love her the same

with my daughter
though we are waiting for her

my daughter will learn 
buy in the surrounded privacy

My daughter with her way
But my not feeling the memory inside

My daughter helps too
My daughter turns it off too

my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me
which I feel formerly about for
