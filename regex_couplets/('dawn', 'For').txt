('dawn', 'For')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Forecasting the story before dawn
For an ungraspable time

dawn already formerly nights 
For Mitt Romney

dawn formerly
Formerly a way like this one

battery dawn nights 
Formerly away there are constant ways

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

to the other end battery dawn 
Forty-one seconds in

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
