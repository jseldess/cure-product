('dawn', 'It')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
It keeps coming down thankfully

Forecasting the story before dawn
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

dawn already formerly nights 
It’s not marshal exactly

battery dawn nights 
It’s not marshall exactly

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
