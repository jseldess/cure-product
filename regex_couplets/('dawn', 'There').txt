('dawn', 'There')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Forecasting the story before dawn
There was very little physical activity

dawn already formerly nights 
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

dawn formerly
There are constant ways

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
There are no constant waves

battery dawn nights
