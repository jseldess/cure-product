('dawn', 'Thou')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Though there are quarters goals

Forecasting the story before dawn
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

dawn already formerly nights 
Though we are waiting for her

dawn formerly
Though we are waiting 

with dawn already formerly nights 
Though we can’t help waiting

battery dawn nights
