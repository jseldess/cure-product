('dawn', 'though')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
As though stationary and a destination

Forecasting the story before dawn
I had nightmares though

dawn already formerly nights 
though it was most emphatically that

dawn formerly
I thought

with dawn already formerly nights 
after though thereâ€™s no memory

battery dawn nights 
I answered what I thought

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
I answered what I thought about

battery dawn nights ending themselves
