('dawn', 'what')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
in light of learning what we see

Forecasting the story before dawn
I invited most of what came next

dawn already formerly nights 
what literally moved

battery dawn nights 
I answered what I thought

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
I assumed what I draw

dawn formerly
I answered what I thought about

battery dawn nights ending themselves
to return what I bought
