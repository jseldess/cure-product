('dawn', 'actions')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
conversations with our reactions

Forecasting the story before dawn
to the ends of my transactions

dawn already formerly nights 
The ends of my transactions

dawn formerly
To the ends of transactions

battery dawn nights 
to the other end of actions

to the other end battery dawn 
the other end transactions

battery dawn 
of my actions

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
The other ends of my transactions

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
