('dawn', 'along')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
bring your child along

Forecasting the story before dawn
The days lined along company

dawn already formerly nights 
formerly along time they were on

battery dawn nights 
formerly along my say to the elections

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
drawn formerly along 

dawn formerly
along cables

battery dawn nights ending themselves
shone formerly along time

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
formerly along the time they were on
