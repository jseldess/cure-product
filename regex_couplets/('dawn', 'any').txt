('dawn', 'any')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Forecasting the story before dawn
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

dawn already formerly nights 
if there is anything 

dawn formerly
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

with dawn already formerly nights 
if that has anything

battery dawn nights 
The many transparent pixel calls

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
or imagined anyway
