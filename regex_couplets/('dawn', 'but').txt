('dawn', 'but')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
but not impart cynicism

Forecasting the story before dawn
but the sun isnâ€™t up

dawn already formerly nights 
that decisions can be attributable

battery dawn nights 
but for memory elsewhere

battery dawn nights ending themselves
but standing in memory

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
decisions that can be attributable
