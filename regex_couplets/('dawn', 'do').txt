('dawn', 'do')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In a sharp downard turn

Forecasting the story before dawn
the dogs and lillies

dawn already formerly nights 
and it doesn’t take long

with dawn already formerly nights 
latency which doesn’t mean anything

battery dawn nights 
I only think I don’t listen
