('dawn', 'else')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
If you have confidence regardless all else

Forecasting the story before dawn
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

dawn already formerly nights 
and elsewhere my memory

dawn formerly
elsewhere by my memory

battery dawn nights 
By my memory elsewhere

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in memory elsewhere

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
