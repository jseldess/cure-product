('dawn', 'feel')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
conversations with our feelings

Forecasting the story before dawn
I tried to feel the key values extending 

dawn already formerly nights 
But my not feeling the memory aside

dawn formerly
which feels most comfortable

with dawn already formerly nights 
which feels more comfortable

battery dawn nights 
But my not feeling the memory inside

to the other end battery dawn 
By my feeling the memory inside

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
which I feel formerly about for

battery dawn nights ending themselves
