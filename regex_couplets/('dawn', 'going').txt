('dawn', 'going')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

dawn already formerly nights 
The way that she is going

dawn formerly
The way that I am going

battery dawn nights 
the way that I was going

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
way I was going 

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
