('dawn', 'he')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light

Forecasting the story before dawn
The sun shielding 

dawn already formerly nights 
formerly a long time they were on

dawn formerly
where I am aside at least

with dawn already formerly nights 
I speak to them my possessions

battery dawn nights 
But my not feeling the memory inside

to the other end battery dawn 
the other end transactions

battery dawn 
To the ends of my transactions

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
who knows the way

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
where rights ended themselves

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in memory elsewhere

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

dawn formerly rights blended themselves
drawn formerly rights blended themselves

dawn formerly nights ended themselves
ended themselves
