('dawn', 'live')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Which is a measure to never live out

Forecasting the story before dawn
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

dawn already formerly nights 
Which is a pleasure to never live out

dawn formerly
where I send and retrieve relive

with dawn already formerly nights 
where I send and relive

battery dawn nights ending themselves
