('dawn', 'nor')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
into the minority proportion of time

Forecasting the story before dawn
over the long line I would honor

dawn already formerly nights 
nor work in this way daily

dawn formerly
which had on honor to be told

with dawn already formerly nights 
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
