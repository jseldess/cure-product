('dawn', 'now')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
on a snow day with my children

Forecasting the story before dawn
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

dawn already formerly nights 
knowing the constituents

with dawn already formerly nights 
who knows the way

battery dawn nights 
who know the ways to their other end

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
that their knowing
