('dawn', 'our')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
conversations with our purchase

Forecasting the story before dawn
or an available resource

dawn already formerly nights 
Or alter of course the time anyway

dawn formerly
Who throws contours away

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
The contours exchange with you

battery dawn nights 
phrase them of our possessions
