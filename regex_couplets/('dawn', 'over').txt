('dawn', 'over')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I step over the edge

Forecasting the story before dawn
over the long time up in the sky

dawn already formerly nights 
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

dawn formerly
for not paying sound overwhelmed

with dawn already formerly nights 
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
