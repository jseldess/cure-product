('dawn', 'really')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Forecasting the story before dawn
without really agreeing

dawn formerly
without really branding 

with dawn already formerly nights 
without really needing

dawn already formerly nights 
also didn’t really move

battery dawn nights ending themselves
