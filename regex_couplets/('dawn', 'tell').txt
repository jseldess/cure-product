('dawn', 'tell')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Then I constellate my time family country

Forecasting the story before dawn
I had to tell them the news

dawn already formerly nights 
So I constellate the time family country

dawn formerly
and that man comes on to tell me 

battery dawn nights
