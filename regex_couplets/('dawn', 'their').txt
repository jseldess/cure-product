('dawn', 'their')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
We can wrestle them with their goals

Forecasting the story before dawn
I am not allowed to see their face

dawn already formerly nights 
without their agreement

with dawn already formerly nights 
to their other end

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
that their knowing
