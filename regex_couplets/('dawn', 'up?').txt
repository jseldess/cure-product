('dawn', 'up?')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In a sharp downard turn

Forecasting the story before dawn
The sun shielding 

dawn already formerly nights 
without really agreeing

dawn formerly
for the duration of the answer

with dawn already formerly nights 
Though we are waiting for her

battery dawn nights 
I end up in Bach

to the other end battery dawn 
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

battery dawn 
Who throws contours away

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
The contours exchange with you

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
I assumed what I draw

battery dawn nights ending themselves
radiating from housing

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
I thought
