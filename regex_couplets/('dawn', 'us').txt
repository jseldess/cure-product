('dawn', 'us')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Forecasting the story before dawn
The ventillation rushes on

dawn already formerly nights 
I want to cite a poem so usual

dawn formerly
useless for not having paid

with dawn already formerly nights 
in the form filled offered in trust

battery dawn nights 
radiating from housing

battery dawn nights ending themselves
I have them trust in me
