('dawn', 'waiting')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
There are spots waiting

dawn already formerly nights 
Though we are waiting for her

dawn formerly
Though we are waiting 

with dawn already formerly nights 
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

battery dawn nights 
waiting out front or up above
