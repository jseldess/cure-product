('dawn', 'will')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

Forecasting the story before dawn
will not be the same

dawn already formerly nights 
would only willingly break

with dawn already formerly nights 
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

battery dawn nights 
my daughter will learn 

dawn formerly
