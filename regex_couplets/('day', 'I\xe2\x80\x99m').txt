('day', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

On a snow day with my children
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

One day there is direction
I’m simply inside

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
Right now I’m the cart

I argued the days felt longer
where I’m watching my tv

at least most days
