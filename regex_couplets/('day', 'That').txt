('day', 'That')

On a snow day with my children
Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them

One day there is direction
That is itself not still

I argued the days felt longer
That you can see only the back of

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
That company creates a life

embodied everyday
That I captured an afterimage

The day
That are my right to say
