('day', 'There')

On a snow day with my children
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

One day there is direction
There are quarterly goals

I argued the days felt longer
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

The day
There are constant ways

at least most days
