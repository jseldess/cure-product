('day', 'Thou')

On a snow day with my children
Though there are quarters goals

Actually one day there is direction
Though how can you know without direction

I argued the days felt longer
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

The day
Though we are waiting for her

between that day
Though we are breaking 

at least most days
