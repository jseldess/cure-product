('day', 'We')

On a snow day with my children
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

One day there is direction
We can wrestle them with their goals

I argued the days felt longer
We had to say goodbye there

The day
We had inhabited actually

I have a memory between the day
We got paid one way by a voice

at least most days
We ask say in that case
