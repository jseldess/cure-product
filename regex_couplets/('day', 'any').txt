('day', 'any')

On a snow day with my children
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

One day there is direction
Before anyone walks across the opening

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
at any time it can drift again

I argued the days felt longer
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The days long aligned
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
The entire company

I argued the days were longer
Since I had to hold the entire company

The days aligned for company
The days aligned long company

The days lined along company
That company creates a life

embodied everyday
there wasnâ€™t any television 

The day
or alter of course the time anyway

between that day
if there is anything 

I have a memory between the day
They have very many choices

at least most days
or imagined anyway
