('day', 'aspiration')

On a snow day with my children
They are called aspirational

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
with little reasons to aspiration

The days long aligned
embodied aspirations

The days were long aligned
with little reason to aspiration

embodied everyday
full of aspirations

The days are long
