('day', 'but')

On a snow day with my children
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

One day there is direction
but not impart cynicism

I argued the days felt longer
but it continued

The days long aligned
but it continued rippling muscle

The days were long aligned
but would I love her the same

The day
that decisions can be attributable

at least most days
but for memory elsewhere
