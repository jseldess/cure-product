('day', 'call')

On a snow day with my children
not calling or echoing for once

One day there is direction
though it was most emphatically that

I argued the days felt longer
They are called aspirational

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
Which can be called confidence

The day
to take the call

at least most days
recalling aside
