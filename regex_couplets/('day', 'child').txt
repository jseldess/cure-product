('day', 'child')

On a snow day with my children
as pure as my children

One day there is direction
especially in a child

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
only fragments of time with my children

on a day there will be direction
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

I argued the days felt longer
even my child

The day
my possession of my children

at least most days
speech my possession of my children
