('day', 'company')

On a snow day with my children
Or the company

I argued the days felt longer
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The days long aligned
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
The entire company

I argued the days were longer
Since I had to hold the entire company

The days aligned for company
The days aligned long company

The days lined along company
That company creates a life

embodied everyday
