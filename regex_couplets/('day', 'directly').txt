('day', 'directly')

On a snow day with my children
if not directly on my skin

One day there is direction
of not directly from my skin

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
But not to me directly

I argued the days felt longer
The sun high enough to enter directly 

The day
The sun high enough to strike directly
