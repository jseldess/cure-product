('day', 'eat')

On a snow day with my children
too sunny to eat ice cream

One day there is direction
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

I argued the days felt longer
of the habits I create

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
of the habits they create.

I argued the days were longer
That company creates a life

embodied everyday
it was not just a defeat

The day
was not just a defeat

at least most days
for the creation of the universe
