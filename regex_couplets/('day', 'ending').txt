('day', 'ending')

On a snow day with my children
battery dawn nights blending themselves

One day there is direction
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I argued the days felt longer
talking into pheasants bending themselves

The day
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

at least most days
battery dawn nights ending themselves
