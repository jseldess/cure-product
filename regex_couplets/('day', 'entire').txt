('day', 'entire')

On a snow day with my children
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
The entire company

The days long aligned
Since I had to hold the entire company

I argued the days were longer
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

The days are long
