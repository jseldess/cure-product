('day', 'find')

On a snow day with my children
I want to find a way to block it incoming

One day there is direction
I can find a way to block it incoming

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
with goals I find there

I argued the days felt longer
Companies increasingly find 

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I even know what I would find

The day
So I find myself at home
