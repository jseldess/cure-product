('day', 'full')

On a snow day with my children
It keeps coming down thankfully

One day there is direction
I am full of potential

The days are long
with full potential to movement

The days long aligned
full of aspirations

The days were long aligned
full of potential

embodied everyday
full of the missing words

The day
still carefully

at least most days
