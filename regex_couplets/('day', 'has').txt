('day', 'has')

On a snow day with my children
conversations with our purchase

One day there is direction
Before anyone has walked across the opening

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
It has been since

I argued the days felt longer
in traversing my purchase

The day
if that has anything

I have a memory between the day
I have entered my purchases

at least most days
at the site of a purchase
