('day', 'he')

On a snow day with my children
Before we walk across the wide field

One day there is direction
Then fall then summer

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
into the stream of pictures

on a day there will be direction
interjecting into the stream

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
interjecting into the stream of pictures

One day was actually
Though there are quarters goals

Actually one day there is direction
The edge is put in place

I argued the days felt longer
and testing the edge and gravity

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I tried to feel the key values extending 

The days long aligned
I argued the days were longer

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
there was no promotion

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
I agrued the days were longer

The days aligned for company
The days are long

The days were long
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
or argued for them at least

The days were long aligned
The days aligned long company

The days lined along company
The days of public quantity

The days of private data
The days of parsing data

embodied everyday
As an extension of the values

The days of quantity 
I hear it between bills and stuff

The days of public data
And as an extension of the values

The day
and we could inhabit the room easy

between that day
to the ends of my transactions

I have a memory between the day
Or alter of course the time anyway

at least most days
where I am aside
