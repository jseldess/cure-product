('day', 'here')

On a snow day with my children
I’ll get there eventually

One day there is direction
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

on a day there will be direction
Though there are quarters goals

Actually one day there is direction
The edge isn’t even there

I argued the days felt longer
there was no promotion

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
that potential is there for you

The days are long
Where I take my liesure

The day
Where in me did I host

I have a memory between the day
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

at least most days
where I am aside
