('day', 'if')

On a snow day with my children
drifting away

One day there is direction
if not directly on my skin

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
drifting does not feel an exception

I argued the days felt longer
That company creates a life

embodied everyday
Life is with people

The days are long
If I take a different measure

The day
if there is anything 

I have a memory between the day
if you have providence

at least most days
if only on the way to the trash
