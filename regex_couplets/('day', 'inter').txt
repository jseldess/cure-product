('day', 'inter')

On a snow day with my children
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

One day there is direction
interjecting on a day ambition

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
interjecting into the stream

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
interferring 

On a day there will be direction
way high up in the inter

I argued the days felt longer
with internally regulated climate

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
Then I saw them interview

The day
my interfaced stand data
