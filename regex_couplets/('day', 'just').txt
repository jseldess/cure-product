('day', 'just')

On a snow day with my children
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

One day there is direction
Theyâ€™re just not mine

Actually one day there is direction
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I argued the days felt longer
it was not just a defeat

The day
was not just a defeat

at least most days
