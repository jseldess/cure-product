('day', 'now')

On a snow day with my children
who knows the way

One day there is direction
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

On a day there will be direction
how can I know without direction

I argued the days felt longer
out in the snow fall

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I take it out in the snow fall

The day
knowing the constituents

at least most days
that their knowing
