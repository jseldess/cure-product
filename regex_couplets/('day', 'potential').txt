('day', 'potential')

On a snow day with my children
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

One day there is direction
I am full of potential

The days are long
with full potential to movement

The days long aligned
full of potential

The days were long aligned
that potential is there for you

The days were long
