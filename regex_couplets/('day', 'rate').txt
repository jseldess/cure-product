('day', 'rate')

On a snow day with my children
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

One day there is direction
and my heart rate

I argued the days felt longer
and strategies not tactics

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I aspirate with little vision

embodied everyday
