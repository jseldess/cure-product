('day', 'reason')

On a snow day with my children
reasons resources

One day there is direction
with reasons

I argued the days felt longer
with little reason to move

The days were long
with little reasons to aspiration

The days long aligned
with little reasons to move

The days were long aligned
with little reason to aspiration

embodied everyday
embodied with little reason

The days are long
Toward the start informally given my reasons

The day
More reasons around my country 

at least most days
and could be inflected with reasons
