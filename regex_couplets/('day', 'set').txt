('day', 'set')

On a snow day with my children
upset by Gingrich

I argued the days felt longer
in front of the set afternoon

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
in front of the set of regulations

The days long aligned
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

The day
Um, upset by Gingrich

at least most days
presets
