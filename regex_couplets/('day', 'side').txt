('day', 'side')

On a snow day with my children
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

One day there is direction
I’m simply inside

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
aside from the retinas

I argued that the days were longer
actually considering the end

The day
But my not feeling the memory aside

at least most days
where I am aside
