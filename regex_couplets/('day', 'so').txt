('day', 'so')

On a snow day with my children
reasons resources

One day there is direction
You can hear it also through your leisure

I argued the days felt longer
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The days long aligned
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
My associations

The days aligned for company
with little reason to move

The days were long
with little reasons to aspiration

The days are long
with little reasons to move

The days were long aligned
with little reason to aspiration

embodied everyday
embodied with little reason

The days of quantity 
If I take some different measure

The day
I want to cite a poem so usual

at least most days
also didnâ€™t really move
