('day', 'tell')

On a snow day with my children
Then I constellate my time family country

One day there is direction
So I constellate the time family country

I argued the days felt longer
I had to tell them the news

The days were long aligned
I tell you my purposes

The day
and that man comes on to tell me 

at least most days
