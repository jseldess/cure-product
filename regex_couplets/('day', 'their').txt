('day', 'their')

On a snow day with my children
We can wrestle them with their goals

I argued the days felt longer
I am not allowed to see their face

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
that their economic value 

I argued the days were longer
without their agreement

at least most days
that their knowing
