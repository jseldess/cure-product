('day', 'time.')

On a snow day with my children
Then I constellate my time family country

One day there is direction
only fragments of time with my children

on a day there will be direction
where I sleep at times

I argued the days felt longer
The long time I had a vision

The day
or alter of course the time anyway

between that day
formerly a long time they were on

I have a memory between the day
So I constellate the time family country

at least most days
in the long time they were on
