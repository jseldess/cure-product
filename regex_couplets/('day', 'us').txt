('day', 'us')

On a snow day with my children
asynchronous 

One day there is direction
Theyâ€™re just not mine

Actually one day there is direction
russling to stay still

I argued the days felt longer
So stay with us

embodied everyday
but it continued rippling muscle

The days were long aligned
I reuse unassimilable visions

The day
in the form filled offered in trust

I have a memory between the day
I want to cite a poem so usual

at least most days
radiating from housing
