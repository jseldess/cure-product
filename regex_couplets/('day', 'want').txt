('day', 'want')

On a snow day with my children
When I want something

One day there is direction
I want to find a way to block it incoming

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
I want but not to impart cynicism

I argued the days felt longer
all that I can think I want

The day
I want to cite a poem so usual

at least most days
