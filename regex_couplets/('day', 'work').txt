('day', 'work')

On a snow day with my children
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

One day there is direction
nor work in this way daily

I argued the days felt longer
your bid to the next highest ranked network

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I need the work

The day
nor envy honest work

at least most days
