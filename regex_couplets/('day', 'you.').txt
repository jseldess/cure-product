('day', 'you.')

On a snow day with my children
Though how can you know without direction

I argued the days felt longer
That you can see only the back of

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
since you can imagine movement

The days are long
where you can earn more 

The day
You can hear it also through your leisure

at least most days
the young ripples inaudibly
