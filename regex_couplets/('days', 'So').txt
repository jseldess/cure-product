('days', 'so')

I argued the days felt longer
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The days long aligned
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I agrued the days were longer
My associations

The days aligned for company
with little reason to move

The days were long
with little reasons to aspiration

The days are long
with little reasons to move

The days were long aligned
with little reason to aspiration

The days of quantity 
embodied with little reason

at least most days
also didnâ€™t really move
