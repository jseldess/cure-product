('days', 'act')

I argued the days felt longer
and strategies not tactics

The days long aligned
I was enjoying acting against myself

I argued the days were longer
I was enjoined to act again myself

I agrued the days were longer
I am bid to act again

The days aligned for company
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
I am enjoined to act again

The days are long
actually considering the end

at least most days
I turn not sad exactly
