('days', 'any')

I argued the days felt longer
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The days long aligned
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I agrued the days were longer
The entire company

I argued the days were longer
Since I had to hold the entire company

The days aligned for company
The days aligned long company

The days lined along company
That company creates a life

The days are long
there wasnâ€™t any television 

at least most days
or imagined anyway
