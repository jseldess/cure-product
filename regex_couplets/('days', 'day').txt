('days', 'day')

I argued the days felt longer
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The days long aligned
I argued the days were longer

I agrued the days were longer
The days aligned for company

The days are long
The days were long

I argued that the days were longer
The days were long aligned

The days aligned long company
The days lined along company

The days of public quantity
The days of private data

The days of parsing data
embodied everyday

The days of quantity 
The days of public data

at least most days
