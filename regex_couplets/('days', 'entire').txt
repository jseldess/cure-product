('days', 'entire')

I argued the days felt longer
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I agrued the days were longer
The entire company

The days long aligned
Since I had to hold the entire company

I argued the days were longer
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

The days are long
