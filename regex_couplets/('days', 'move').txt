('days', 'move')

I argued the days felt longer
since I can imagine movement

The days are long
with little reason to move

The days were long
with little reasons to move

The days long aligned
with full potential to movement

I argued that the days were longer
since you can imagine movement

The days were long aligned
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

at least most days
also didnâ€™t really move
