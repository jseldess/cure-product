('days', 'reason')

I argued the days felt longer
with little reason to move

The days were long
with little reasons to aspiration

The days long aligned
with little reasons to move

The days were long aligned
with little reason to aspiration

The days are long
embodied with little reason

at least most days
and could be inflected with reasons
