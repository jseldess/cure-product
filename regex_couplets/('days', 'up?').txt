('days', 'up?')

I argued the days felt longer
of my economic value

The days long aligned
I argued the days were longer

I agrued the days were longer
And as an extension of the values

The days aligned for company
I am full of potential

The days are long
I argued that the days were longer

The days were long
or argued for them at least

The days were long aligned
The days of public quantity

The days of private data
So stay with us

The days of quantity 
I hear it between bills and stuff

The days of public data
full of aspirations

at least most days
the least productive of myself
