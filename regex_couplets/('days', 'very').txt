('days', 'very')

I argued the days felt longer
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

The days long aligned
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I agrued the days were longer
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
embodied everyday

The days are long
They have very many choices

at least most days
