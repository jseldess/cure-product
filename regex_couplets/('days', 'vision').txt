('days', 'vision')

I argued the days felt longer
The planning process is for visionaries only

The days long aligned
aspirating visions

I agrued the days were longer
I had me a vision

I argued the days were longer
aspirating with visions

The days aligned for company
embodied with little visions

The days are long
little visions

The days were long aligned
aspirating with little visions

The days were long
I aspirate with little vision

at least most days
joined in my television
