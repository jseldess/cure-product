('decision', 'now')

the planning process for decisions
out in the snow fall

attributable decisions
even when close to my knowing

forgetting decisions 
who knows the way

decisioned to learn 
who knows how to turn it off

decisioned to learn back
that their knowing

decisions that can be attributable
