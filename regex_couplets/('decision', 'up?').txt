('decision', 'up?')

the planning process for decisions
I see the back of falling values

attributable decisions
in traversing my purpose

decisions that can be attributable
I continue to presume

forgetting decisions 
I presume to others

decisioned to learn 
in the form filled offered in trust

decisioned to learn back
by in the sound privacy

decisioned by the prospect
by in the sounded privacy

phase decisioned by the prospect
my daughter will learn 

that decisions can be attributable
converting sight into a purchase

phase decisioned
buy in the surrounded privacy

I ask say in that phase decisioned
sizes track for asking sound

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
in that decisions can be attributable
