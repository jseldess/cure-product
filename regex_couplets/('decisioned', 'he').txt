('decisioned', 'he')

decisioned to learn 
speak them of my possessions

decisioned to learn back
stopping into the prospect

decisioned by the prospect
by in the sounded privacy

phase decisioned by the prospect
by in the sound privacy

phase decisioned
for learning by the prospect

I ask say in that phase decisioned
step by into the prospect
