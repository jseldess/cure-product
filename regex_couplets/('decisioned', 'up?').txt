('decisioned', 'up?')

decisioned to learn 
in the form filled offered in trust

decisioned to learn back
by in the sound privacy

decisioned by the prospect
by in the sounded privacy

phase decisioned by the prospect
my daughter will learn 

phase decisioned
buy in the surrounded privacy

I ask say in that phase decisioned
sizes track for asking sound
