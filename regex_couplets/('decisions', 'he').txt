('decisions', 'he')

the planning process for decisions
I see the back of falling values

attributable decisions
I get through there

forgetting decisions 
I presume to others

that decisions can be attributable
the way was water

decisions that can be attributable
phrase them

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
The sun high enough to strike directly
