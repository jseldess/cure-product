('designed', 'up?')

designed to hold up my underwear
I designed them to hold up my underwear

designed 
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

worn as it was designed
all parties would be held

as it was designed
people would be helped

as it was designed literally
where I send and relive would be held
