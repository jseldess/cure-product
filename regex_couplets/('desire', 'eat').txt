('desire', 'eat')

others desires
But I can’t let myself treat 

If I let myself see others desires
Then I can’t presume to treat others

drifting away needs others presume desires
I let myself treat

Others desires as legitimate
executive breath

my desires were open
Where I put it beating

I wish my desires were open
execute breath
