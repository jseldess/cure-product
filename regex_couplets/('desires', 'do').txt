('desires', 'do')

others desires
does not feel an exception

If I let myself see others desires
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

drifting away needs others presume desires
in a sharp downward turn 

Others desires as legitimate
The dogs and lillies

my desires were open
which I brought down with qualities

I wish my desires were open
I brought my head down
