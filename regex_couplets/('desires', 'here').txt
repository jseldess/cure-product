('desires', 'here')

others desires
I’ll get there eventually

If I let myself see others desires
where I sleep at times

drifting away needs others presume desires
There are quarterly goals

Others desires as legitimate
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

my desires were open
Where I put it beating

I wish my desires were open
I’ll get there ruins
