('desires', 'sleep.')

others desires
where I sleep at times

drifting away needs others presume desires
Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times

Others desires as legitimate
Interrupted sleep or

my desires were open
While I should be sleeping 

I wish my desires were open
Looking back while I should be sleeping
