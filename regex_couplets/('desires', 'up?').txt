('desires', 'up?')

others desires
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

If I let myself see others desires
as an impure product

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I canâ€™t presume to need others

Others desires as legitimate
Then I cannot see face value

my desires were open
Out of the remnants 

I wish my desires were open
and could be mapped and weighed
