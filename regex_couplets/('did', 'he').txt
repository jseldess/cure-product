('did', 'he')

Where in me did I host
in the form filled offered in trust

Where in me did I last
Elsewhere by my memory

Where in me did I lose
washed by my memory

Where in me did I loose
in the form filled offered trust

Where in me did I lose trust
in the form filled offered

In my heart did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

Where did we lose trust
To the ends of transactions

also didnâ€™t really move
By my memory elsewhere
