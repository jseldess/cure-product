('did', 'here')

Where in me did I host
Elsewhere by my memory

Where in me did I last
Where I stand and relive

Where in me did I lose
Where in me did I loose

Where in me did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

Where did we lose trust
Is there a baby and a bear

also didnâ€™t really move
By my memory elsewhere
