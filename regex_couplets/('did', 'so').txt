('did', 'so')

Where in me did I host
I want to cite a poem so usual

Where in me did I last
and sound redundant

Where in me did I lose
so still watch them

Where in me did I loose
so still them

Where in me did I lose trust
by in the sound privacy

also didnâ€™t really move
buy in the sound privacy
