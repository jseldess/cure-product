('did', 'us')

Where in me did I host
in the form filled offered in trust

Where in me did I last
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

Where in me did I lose
about the sight hosting trusting

Where in me did I loose
in the form filled offered trust

Where in me did I lose trust
In my heart did I lose trust

In what part did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

Where did we lose trust
radiating from housing
