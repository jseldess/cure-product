('direction', 'directionless')

Whereas direction is beside the point
into rotating directionless 

Of course there is a direction
in rotating directionless space

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
into rotating and directionless space

Though how can you know without direction
into directionless space

stopping off in all directions
