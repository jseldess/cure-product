('direction', 'he')

Whereas direction is beside the point
Where I sleep at times

into rotating directionless 
into the stream of pictures

Of course there is a direction
When I want something

One day there is direction
Then fall then summer

on a day there will be direction
interjecting into the stream

Actually one day there is direction
Though there are quarters goals 

how can I know without direction
The edge is put in place

in rotating directionless space
I canâ€™t fix them without direction

into rotating and directionless space
there are quarters 

Though how can you know without direction
I step over the edge

and then into rotating and directional space
If I step over the edge

into directionless space
what I find there

stopping off in all directions
stepping off into the middle
