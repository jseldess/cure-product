('direction', 'how')

Whereas direction is beside the point
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

Of course there is a direction
how can I know without direction

for how can I know without direction
Though how can you know without direction

into rotating and directionless space
for how can you know without direction

into directionless space
who knows how to turn it off

stopping off in all directions
