('direction', 'know')

Whereas direction is beside the point
who knows the way

Of course there is a direction
how can I know without direction

for how can I know without direction
Though how can you know without direction

into rotating and directionless space
for how can you know without direction

into directionless space
I even know what I would find

stopping off in all directions
