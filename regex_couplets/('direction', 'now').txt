('direction', 'now')

Whereas direction is beside the point
On a snow day with my children

into rotating directionless 
who knows the way

Of course there is a direction
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

One day there is direction
how can I know without direction

for how can I know without direction
Though how can you know without direction

into rotating and directionless space
for how can you know without direction

into directionless space
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

stopping off in all directions
