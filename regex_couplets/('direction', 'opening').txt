('direction', 'opening')

Whereas direction is beside the point
Before we walk across the wide opening

Of course there is a direction
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

One day there is direction
Before anyone walks across the opening

on a day there will be direction
The simple act opening surmounted

stopping off in all directions
