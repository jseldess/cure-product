('direction', 'rest')

Whereas direction is beside the point
wrestling to stay still

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
We can wrestle them with their goals

into rotating and directionless space
We can rest there in them with their goals

Though how can you know without direction
that agreed one of rest

stopping off in all directions
