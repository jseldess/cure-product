('direction', 'rotating')

Whereas direction is beside the point
into rotating directionless 

Of course there is a direction
Rather it itself is rotating

in rotating directionless space
not rotating

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
into rotating and directionless space

Though how can you know without direction
and then into rotating and directional space

for how can you know without direction
not even rotating

stopping off in all directions
