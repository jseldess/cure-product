('direction', 'so')

Whereas direction is beside the point
Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type

into rotating directionless 
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Of course there is a direction
When I want something

One day there is direction
You can hear it also through your leisure

stopping off in all directions
and could be inflected with reasons
