('direction', 'up?')

Whereas direction is beside the point
I suspend my connections to you

into rotating directionless 
into the stream of pictures

Of course there is a direction
The sun isn’t up 

One day there is direction
Then fall then summer

on a day there will be direction
interjecting into the stream of pictures

Actually one day there is direction
Though there are quarters goals 

how can I know without direction
for how can I know without direction

in rotating directionless space
russling to stay still

I can’t fix them without direction
there are quarters 

into rotating and directionless space
Though how can you know without direction

and then into rotating and directional space
for how can you know without direction

into directionless space
slow asynchronous

stopping off in all directions
I assumed that they were divisible
