('direction', 'us')

Whereas direction is beside the point
I suspend my connections to you

into rotating directionless 
I suspend live connections to you

Of course there is a direction
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

One day there is direction
They’re just not mine

Actually one day there is direction
russling to stay still

I can’t fix them without direction
slow asynchronous

stopping off in all directions
