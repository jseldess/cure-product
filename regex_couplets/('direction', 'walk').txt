('direction', 'walk')

Whereas direction is beside the point
Before we walk across the wide field

into rotating directionless 
Before we walk across the wide opening

Of course there is a direction
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

One day there is direction
Before anyone walks across the opening

on a day there will be direction
there was no walking along the pleasure

stopping off in all directions
