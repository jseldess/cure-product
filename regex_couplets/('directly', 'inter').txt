('directly', 'inter')

if not directly on my skin
interjecting on a day ambition

of not directly from my skin
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

But not to me directly
hold at intervals riding forward

The sun high enough to enter directly 
Then I saw them interview

The sun high enough to strike directly
