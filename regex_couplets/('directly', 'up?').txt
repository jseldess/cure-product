('directly', 'up?')

if not directly on my skin
Of course there is a direction

of not directly from my skin
The sun isnâ€™t up 

But not to me directly
Spinning around the heart

The sun high enough to enter directly 
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

The sun high enough to strike directly
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
