('distance', 'any')

Falling from this distance
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

A person from a distance
Or the company

dislocated and a person from a distance
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

And from a weak distance
there wasnâ€™t any television 

And from that great distance
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

And from a great distance
without any further damage
