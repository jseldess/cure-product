('distance', 'do')

Falling from this distance
In a sharp downard turn

A person from a distance
the dogs and lillies

And from a weak distance
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

And from that great distance
around the dogs and lillies

And from a great distance
I click my zipcode up where it should be down
