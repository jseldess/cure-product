('distance', 'he')

Falling from this distance
Face falling off the edge of the face

A person from a distance
The CEO tells me to embody values

dislocated and a person from a distance
Spinning around the heart

And from a weak distance
where I need gravity

And from that great distance
around the dogs and lillies

And from a great distance
While we’re up in the sky
