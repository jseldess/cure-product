('distance', 'tell')

Falling from this distance
Then I constellate my time family country

A person from a distance
The CEO tells me to embody values

dislocated and a person from a distance
I had to tell them the news

And from a weak distance
I tell you my purposes

And from that great distance
I tell you the weight of my purchases
