('distance', 'up?')

Falling from this distance
value falling off the edge of the face

A person from a distance
The CEO tells me to embody values

dislocated and a person from a distance
Spinning around the heart

And from a weak distance
I tell you my purposes

And from that great distance
around the dogs and lillies

And from a great distance
While weâ€™re up in the sky
