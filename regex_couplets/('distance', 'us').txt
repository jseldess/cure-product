('distance', 'us')

Falling from this distance
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

A person from a distance
You use the most essential parts

And from a weak distance
I wear suspenders

And from that great distance
I used my technology

And from a great distance
a futile joyous white sun
