('do', 'As')

The dogs and lillies
Ask who I am

in a sharp downward turn 
As though stationary and a destination

does not feel an exception
Assimilable or

I brought my head down
Aspirational strategy

What I do in my liesure
As a clone, illegally conceived

here is the site of the battle of maldon
