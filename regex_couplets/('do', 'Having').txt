('do', 'Having')

The dogs and lillies
Having transitioned from leisure to work

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
Having been purchased out of you

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Having seen more than 

latency which doesn’t mean anything
Having seen more than I can remember
