('do', 'IN')

The dogs and lillies
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

I brought my head down
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON

What I do in my liesure
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

here is the site of the battle of maldon
By NATASHA SINGER

and it doesn’t take long
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

I only think I don’t listen
