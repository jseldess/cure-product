The dogs and lillies
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
I’m simply inside

does not feel an exception
Right now I’m the cart

in a sharp downward turn 
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
where I’m watching my tv

I only think I don’t listen
