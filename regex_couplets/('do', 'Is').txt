('do', 'Is')

The dogs and lillies
Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
Is the weight of my purchases

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Is the weight of my click or zipcode

here is the site of the battle of maldon
Is there a baby and a bear

and it doesn’t take long
