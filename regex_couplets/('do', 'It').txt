('do', 'It')

The dogs and lillies
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
It keeps coming down thankfully

does not feel an exception
It has been since

in a sharp downward turn 
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
It’s morning 

What I do in my liesure
It’s not marshal exactly

and it doesn’t take long
