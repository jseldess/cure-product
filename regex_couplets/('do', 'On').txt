The dogs and lillies
On a snow day with my children

in a sharp downward turn 
One day there is direction

does not feel an exception
One year or

I brought my head down
On the bandwidth I was on

which I brought down with qualities
On the timeline I was on

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
On the other hand

What I do in my liesure
One was up where it should be down

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
