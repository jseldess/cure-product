('do', 'That')

The dogs and lillies
That’s exaclty what I want for them

does not feel an exception
That’s where I sleep at times

the down arrow
That’s when they really take

which I brought down with qualities
That you can see only the back of

What I do in my liesure
That I captured an afterimage

here is the site of the battle of maldon
That are my right to say

I only think I don’t listen
