('do', 'Thou')

The dogs and lillies
Though there are quarters goals

does not feel an exception
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

What I do in my liesure
Though in not many acts

I walk up and don’t work anymore
Though we are waiting for her

and it doesn’t take long
Though we are waiting 

latency which doesn’t mean anything
Though we can’t help waiting

I only think I don’t listen
