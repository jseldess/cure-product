('do', 'away')

The dogs and lillies
drifting away

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
drifting away needs others presume desires

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
drifting away needs

in a sharp downward turn 
drifting away from the task

sudden downward turn
Who throws contours away

and it doesn’t take long
