('do', 'bill')

The dogs and lillies
between bills and stuffed animals

in a sharp downward turn 
I hear it between bills and stuff

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
I can hear it between bills and stuff

What I do in my liesure
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I walk up and don’t work anymore
billowing in the cloud

here is the site of the battle of maldon
until the bill came

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
the bill my detuning 

I only think I don’t listen
