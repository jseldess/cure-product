('do', 'blend')

The dogs and lillies
battery dawn nights blending themselves

In a sharp downard turn
walking into percents blending themselves

here is the site of the battle of maldon
where I blend and relive

latency which doesn’t mean anything
where lights blended themselves

and it doesn’t take long
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

I only think I don’t listen
