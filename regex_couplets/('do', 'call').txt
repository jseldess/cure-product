('do', 'call')

The dogs and lillies
not calling or echoing for once

In a sharp downard turn
though it was most emphatically that

I brought my head down
They are called aspirational

What I do in my liesure
Which can be called confidence

here is the site of the battle of maldon
to take the call

and it doesn’t take long
The many transparent pixel calls

I only think I don’t listen
