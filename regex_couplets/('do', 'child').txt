The dogs and lillies
On a snow day with my children

in a sharp downward turn 
as pure as my children

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i

In a sharp downard turn
about my children’s consumption

It keeps coming down thankfully
especially in a child

does not feel an exception
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

my possession of my children

latency which doesn’t mean anything
speech my possession of my children

and it doesn’t take long
