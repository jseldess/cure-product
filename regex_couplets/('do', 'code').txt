('do', 'code')

The dogs and lillies
as long as I have access to the code

does not feel an exception
May I have your zip code

I brought my head down
I spend time online learning to code

which I brought down with qualities
learned without too much difficulty to code

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
falling off the encoded end

What I do in my liesure
encoded off the end

I walk up and don’t work anymore
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

One was up where it should be down
Is the weight of my click or zipcode

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I click or my zipcode

here is the site of the battle of maldon
zipcode

and it doesn’t take long
