('do', 'count')

The dogs and lillies
Then I constellate my time family country

in a sharp downward turn 
So I constellate the time family country

I brought my head down
I brought my count down

I put my head down
without the long time I was accounting

Undoubtedly 
the simple act of honoring an accountant

What I do in my liesure
around my country 

here is the site of the battle of maldon
More reasons around my country 

and it doesnâ€™t take long
