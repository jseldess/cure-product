('do', 'desire')

The dogs and lillies
others desires

does not feel an exception
If I let myself see others desires

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
drifting away needs others presume desires

in a sharp downward turn 
Others desires as legitimate

I brought my head down
my desires were open

which I brought down with qualities
I wish my desires were open

I brought my qualities down
a similar desire against me

I put my bread down
