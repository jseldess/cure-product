('do', 'drifting')

The dogs and lillies
drifting away

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
drifting does not feel an exception

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
For whom drifting is not an exception

What does it mean to drift
the drifting is not something special

in a sharp downward turn 
drifting away needs

to the down arrow
drifting away from the task

sudden downward turn
