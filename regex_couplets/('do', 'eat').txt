('do', 'eat')

The dogs and lillies
too sunny to eat ice cream

In a sharp downard turn
I reach repeated expressions first

It keeps coming down thankfully
I propogated repeated expressions first

does not feel an exception
But I can’t let myself treat 

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

in a sharp downward turn 
I let myself treat

I brought my head down
Where I put it beating

which I brought down with qualities
executive breath

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
of the habits I create

What I do in my liesure
it was not just a defeat

So I work and don’t look any
And from that great distance

around the dogs and lillies
And from a great distance

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
was not just a defeat

and it doesn’t take long
burrowed about from repeated travels

latency which doesn’t mean anything
for the creation of the universe

I only think I don’t listen
