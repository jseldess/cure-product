('do', 'ending')

The dogs and lillies
battery dawn nights blending themselves

In a sharp downard turn
I tried to feel the key values extending 

What I do in my liesure
talking into pheasants bending themselves

Undoubtedly 
talking into percents bending themselves

here is the site of the battle of maldon
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

and it doesn’t take long
battery dawn nights ending themselves

I only think I don’t listen
