('do', 'enter')

The dogs and lillies
I have entered my phone

In a sharp downard turn
The sun high enough to enter directly 

I walk up and don’t work anymore
I enter the flattening mirror

here is the site of the battle of maldon
I have entered my purposes

and it doesn’t take long
I had entered my phone

I only think I don’t listen
