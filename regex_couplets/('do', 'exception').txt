('do', 'exception')

The dogs and lillies
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
does not feel an exception

drifting does not feel an exception
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

in a sharp downward turn 
For whom drifting is not an exception

What does it mean to drift
