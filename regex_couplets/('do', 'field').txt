('do', 'field')

The dogs and lillies
Before we walk across the wide field

in a sharp downward turn 
stopped light with validated variegated fields

In a sharp downard turn
Before anyone has walked across the field

does not feel an exception
stopped light with validated fields

and it doesnâ€™t take long
