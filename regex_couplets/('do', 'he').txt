('do', 'he')

The dogs and lillies
I step off the edge

in a sharp downward turn 
where I sleep at times

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

In a sharp downard turn
Then fall then summer from my face

It keeps coming down thankfully
Then fall then summer

does not feel an exception
others desires

drifting does not feel an exception
The sun isn’t up

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

What does it mean to drift
the drifting is not something special

to the down arrow
That’s where I sleep at times

the down arrow
drifting away from the task

sudden downward turn
The South Carolina primary 

I brought my head down
and my heart rate

I brought my qualities down
Where official policy is to catch and release

which I brought down with qualities
In a continuous theme

I put my bread down
I put my head down

I brought my count down
and could be mapped and weighed

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
I am the first in the office

What I do in my liesure
talking into pheasants bending themselves

Undoubtedly 
But would I love her the same

I walk up and don’t work anymore
advancing the time

So I work and don’t look any
but where is it

here is the site of the battle of maldon
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

around the dogs and lillies
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
They can be waived

One was up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes

and it doesn’t take long
But my not feeling the memory aside

latency which doesn’t mean anything
the resemblance

I only think I don’t listen
traffick is there nonetheless
