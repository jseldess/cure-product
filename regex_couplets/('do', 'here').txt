('do', 'here')

The dogs and lillies
Where I sleep at times

in a sharp downward turn 
Of course there is a direction

does not feel an exception
I’ll get there eventually

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
There are quarterly goals

to the down arrow
That’s where I sleep at times

the down arrow
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I brought my head down
Where official policy is to catch and release

I brought my qualities down
Where I put it beating

which I brought down with qualities
I’ll get there ruins

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
there was no promotion

What I do in my liesure
Where I take my liesure

Undoubtedly 
there was no walking along the pleasure

I walk up and don’t work anymore
but where is it

here is the site of the battle of maldon
And we had to say goodbye to her there

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
where I need gravity

around the dogs and lillies
Where I lead gravity

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
One was up where it should be down

and it doesn’t take long
where I send and retrieve relive

latency which doesn’t mean anything
Where in me did I host

I only think I don’t listen
traffick is there nonetheless
