('do', 'inter')

The dogs and lillies
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

In a sharp downard turn
interjecting on a day ambition

does not feel an exception
way high up in the inter

I brought my head down
hold at intervals riding forward

which I brought down with qualities
at intervals while riding forward

I brought my qualities down
high up in the internet

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
with internally regulated climate

What I do in my liesure
Then I saw them interview

here is the site of the battle of maldon
my interfaced stand data

I only think I don’t listen
