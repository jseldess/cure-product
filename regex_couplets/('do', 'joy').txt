('do', 'joy')

The dogs and lillies
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

In a sharp downard turn
I was enjoying acting against myself

What I do in my liesure
a futile joyous white sun

here is the site of the battle of maldon
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

and it doesnâ€™t take long
