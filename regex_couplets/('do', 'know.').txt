('do', 'know.')

The dogs and lillies
who knows the way

In a sharp downard turn
how can I know without direction

does not feel an exception
I even know what I would find

What I do in my liesure
even when close to my knowing

here is the site of the battle of maldon
knowing the constituents

latency which doesn’t mean anything
who knows how to turn it off

and it doesn’t take long
that their knowing

I only think I don’t listen
