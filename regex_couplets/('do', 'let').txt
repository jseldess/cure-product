('do', 'let')

The dogs and lillies
But I can’t let myself treat 

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
I let myself treat

in a sharp downward turn 
But I can’t let myself disregard

I brought my head down
It’s the third letter from the end

What I do in my liesure
I let it remind me again

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
