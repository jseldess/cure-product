('do', 'low')

The dogs and lillies
slow

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
slow asynchronous

does not feel an exception
to the pillow

the down arrow
low in the content architecture

which I brought down with qualities
Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
I am not allowed to see their face

What I do in my liesure
under pillowing a cloud

here is the site of the battle of maldon
