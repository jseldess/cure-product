('do', 'man')

The dogs and lillies
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

does not feel an exception
To my children Walt Whitman

drifting does not feel an exception
Walt Whitman

What does it mean to drift
Walt Whitman drifted

in a sharp downward turn 
There are performance reviews

to the down arrow
not many face up

What I do in my liesure
though not many facts up in the sky

I walk up and don’t work anymore
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
They have very many choices

and it doesn’t take long
and that man comes on to tell me 

latency which doesn’t mean anything
The many transparent pixel calls

I only think I don’t listen
