('do', 'morning')

The dogs and lillies
We’ll have coffee this morning

in a sharp downward turn 
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
When I woke up in the morning

In a sharp downard turn
before morning goals

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
Strategy comes before morning

What I do in my liesure
