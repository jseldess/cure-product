('do', 'now')

The dogs and lillies
On a snow day with my children

in a sharp downward turn 
who knows the way

In a sharp downard turn
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

does not feel an exception
Right now I’m the cart

to the down arrow
out in the snow

I brought my head down
out in the snow fall

What I do in my liesure
I take it out in the snow fall

Undoubtedly 
I even know what I would find

I walk up and don’t work anymore
even when close to my knowing

here is the site of the battle of maldon
knowing the constituents

latency which doesn’t mean anything
who knows how to turn it off

and it doesn’t take long
that their knowing

I only think I don’t listen
