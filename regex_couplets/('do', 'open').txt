('do', 'open')

The dogs and lillies
Before we walk across the wide opening

In a sharp downard turn
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

does not feel an exception
my desires were open

which I brought down with qualities
I wish my desires were open

I brought my head down
The simple act opening surmounted

What I do in my liesure
