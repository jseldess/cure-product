('do', 'ring')

The dogs and lillies
interferring 

does not feel an exception
bring your child along

What does it mean to drift
ring

in a sharp downward turn 
hovering above standing water

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
actually considering the end

What I do in my liesure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I walk up and don’t work anymore
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

here is the site of the battle of maldon
storing in surfeit

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
firing and connecting somewhere

latency which doesn’t mean anything
The prospect for veering healthily
