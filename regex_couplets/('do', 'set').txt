('do', 'set')

The dogs and lillies
upset by Gingrich

I brought my head down
in front of the set afternoon

What I do in my liesure
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
Um, upset by Gingrich

and it doesn’t take long
presets

I only think I don’t listen
