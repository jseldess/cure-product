('do', 'side')

The dogs and lillies
But that is beside the point

in a sharp downward turn 
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
I’m simply inside

does not feel an exception
aside from the retinas

What I do in my liesure
actually considering the end

I walk up and don’t work anymore
But my not feeling the memory aside

and it doesn’t take long
where I am aside

latency which doesn’t mean anything
by the side of the hosting service

I only think I don’t listen
