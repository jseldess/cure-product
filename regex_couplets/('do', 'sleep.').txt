('do', 'sleep.')

The dogs and lillies
Where I sleep at times

in a sharp downward turn 
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
That’s where I sleep at times

the down arrow
Interrupted sleep or

I brought my head down
While I should be sleeping

I brought my qualities down
Looking back while I should be sleeping

which I brought down with qualities
While I should sleep not back in the results

I put my bread down
like flattening sleep 

What I do in my liesure
