('do', 'so')

The dogs and lillies
I’ll pull myself another personality type

in a sharp downward turn 
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
When I want something

does not feel an exception
You can hear it also through your leisure

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
reasons resources

What does it mean to drift
who are so fresh and agile

to the down arrow
soft paper

I brought my head down
A person from a distance

which I brought down with qualities
or an available resource

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

What I do in my liesure
no solid ground to continue along

I walk up and don’t work anymore
Toward the start informally given my reasons

So I work and don’t look any
More reasons 

here is the site of the battle of maldon
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
so that nothing had gravity

and it doesn’t take long
firing and connecting somewhere

latency which doesn’t mean anything
so still watch them

I only think I don’t listen
and could be inflected with reasons
