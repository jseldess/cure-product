('do', 'time.')

The dogs and lillies
Where I sleep at times

in a sharp downward turn 
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
only fragments of time with my children

does not feel an exception
at any time it can drift again

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

What does it mean to drift
over the long time up in the sky

to the down arrow
That’s where I sleep at times

the down arrow
So I constellate the time family country

I brought my head down
I spend time online learning to code

which I brought down with qualities
On the timeline I was on

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

What I do in my liesure
The long time I had a vision

Undoubtedly 
without the long time I was accounting

I walk up and don’t work anymore
The long time I was a vision

here is the site of the battle of maldon
or alter of course the time anyway

and it doesn’t take long
until a happier time found

latency which doesn’t mean anything
formerly a long time they were on

I only think I don’t listen
