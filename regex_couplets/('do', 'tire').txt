('do', 'tire')

The dogs and lillies
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

What I do in my liesure
until I could not tire 

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
for to tire as far back as my history

here is the site of the battle of maldon
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
