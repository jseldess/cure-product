('do', 'trying')

The dogs and lillies
when trying to feel the extension of key values

What I do in my liesure
that I hear without trying

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
wearing trying talking into it

here is the site of the battle of maldon
I spun around trying to touch the spots

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
