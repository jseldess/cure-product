('do', 'turn')

The dogs and lillies
in a sharp downward turn 

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
In a sharp downard turn

It keeps coming down thankfully
sudden downward turn

I brought my head down
I keep turning back again myself

I brought my qualities down
I keep turning back

which I brought down with qualities
who knows how to turn it off

and it doesn’t take long
I turn not sad exactly

I only think I don’t listen
