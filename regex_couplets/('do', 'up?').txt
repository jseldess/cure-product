('do', 'up?')

The dogs and lillies
I assumed it was visible

in a sharp downward turn 
an impure product

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

In a sharp downard turn
Then fall then summer from my face

It keeps coming down thankfully
Then fall then summer

does not feel an exception
but not impart cynicism

drifting does not feel an exception
The sun isn’t up

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

What does it mean to drift
Puffs of air

to the down arrow
sudden downward turn

I brought my head down
I brought my qualities down

which I brought down with qualities
in a continuous vertiginous dream

I put my bread down
I brought my count down

I put my head down
and could be mapped and weighed

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
Then the sun isn’t up

What I do in my liesure
I reuse unassimilable visions

Undoubtedly 
I love my daughter still

I walk up and don’t work anymore
So I look up and don’t walk any

So I work and don’t look any
around my country 

here is the site of the battle of maldon
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

around the dogs and lillies
I spin around

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I tell you my purposes

One was up where it should be down
And for an ungraspable time

and it doesn’t take long
But my not feeling the memory aside

latency which doesn’t mean anything
until a happier time found

I only think I don’t listen
but I own all that’s messageable
