('do', 'us')

The dogs and lillies
I suspend live connections to you

in a sharp downward turn 
asynchronous 

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
because it was really dark

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

In a sharp downard turn
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

does not feel an exception
slow asynchronous

drifting does not feel an exception
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

to the down arrow
I want to cite a poem so usual

I brought my head down
In a vertiginous dream

I brought my qualities down
in a continuous vertiginous dream

which I brought down with qualities
In a continuous theme

I put my bread down
Remnant continuous pages

I brought my count down
The ventillation rushes on

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
I just got a letter

What I do in my liesure
I reuse unassimilable visions

Undoubtedly 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

I walk up and don’t work anymore
it was not just a defeat

So I work and don’t look any
I have them trust in me

here is the site of the battle of maldon
Articles all around us

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I wear suspenders

around the dogs and lillies
I used my technology

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
a futile joyous white sun

and it doesn’t take long
useless for not having paid

latency which doesn’t mean anything
in the form filled offered in trust

I only think I don’t listen
