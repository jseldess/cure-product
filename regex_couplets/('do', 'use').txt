('do', 'use')

The dogs and lillies
because it was really dark

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
You use the most essential parts

which I brought down with qualities
I reuse unassimilable visions

Undoubtedly 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

What I do in my liesure
I reuse indelible tracks 

I walk up and don’t work anymore
I used my technology

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
trackers collecting data on users

and it doesn’t take long
useless for not having paid

latency which doesn’t mean anything
