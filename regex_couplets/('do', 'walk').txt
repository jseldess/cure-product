('do', 'walk')

The dogs and lillies
Before we walk across the wide field

in a sharp downward turn 
Before we walk across the wide opening

In a sharp downard turn
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

does not feel an exception
there was no walking along the pleasure

What I do in my liesure
I walk up and don’t work anymore

So I look up and don’t walk any
walking into percents blending themselves

here is the site of the battle of maldon
