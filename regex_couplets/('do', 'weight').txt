('do', 'weight')

The dogs and lillies
I tell you the weight of my purchases

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I tell you the weight of my purposes

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
weight of my purposes

here is the site of the battle of maldon
The weight kept moaned impression

I only think I donâ€™t listen
