('do', 'When')

The dogs and lillies
When I woke up in the morning

In a sharp downard turn
When I want something

does not feel an exception
When we had jobs that were to earn

I brought my head down
When they really take hold of my finger

which I brought down with qualities
When closed to my knowing

here is the site of the battle of maldon
When I'm watching my tv 

latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything
