('do', 'you.')

The dogs and lillies
Though how can you know without direction

does not feel an exception
You can hear it also through your leisure

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
bring your child along

What does it mean to drift
if you have providence to excess

I brought my head down
That you can see only the back of

What I do in my liesure
where you can earn more 

I walk up and don’t work anymore
If you have confidence regardless all else

here is the site of the battle of maldon
I tell you my purposes

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes

One was up where it should be down
I tell you where I need gravity

and it doesn’t take long
the young ripples inaudibly

I only think I don’t listen
