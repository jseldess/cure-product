('does', 'eat')

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
too sunny to eat ice cream

does not feel an exception
But I can’t let myself treat 

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

and it doesn’t take long
burrowed about from repeated travels

latency which doesn’t mean anything
for the creation of the universe
