('does', 'man')

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

does not feel an exception
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

drifting does not feel an exception
To my children Walt Whitman

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Walt Whitman

What does it mean to drift
Walt Whitman drifted

and it doesn’t take long
and that man comes on to tell me 

latency which doesn’t mean anything
The many transparent pixel calls
