('does', 'time.')

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

does not feel an exception
where I sleep at times

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

What does it mean to drift
over the long time up in the sky

and it doesn’t take long
until a happier time found

latency which doesn’t mean anything
formerly a long time they were on
