('does', 'up?')

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

does not feel an exception
but not impart cynicism

drifting does not feel an exception
The sun isn’t up

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

What does it mean to drift
Puffs of air

and it doesn’t take long
But my not feeling the memory aside

latency which doesn’t mean anything
until a happier time found
