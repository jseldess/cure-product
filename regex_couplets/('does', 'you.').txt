('does', 'you.')

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
Though how can you know without direction

does not feel an exception
You can hear it also through your leisure

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
bring your child along

What does it mean to drift
if you have providence to excess

and it doesn’t take long
the young ripples inaudibly
