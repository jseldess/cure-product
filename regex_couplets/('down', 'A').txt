('down', 'A')

in a sharp downward turn 
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

In a sharp downard turn
All of the time

to the down arrow
And make myself a visible

I brought my head down
A turtle fished out of the lake

I brought my qualities down
A person from a distance

which I brought down with qualities
And as an extension of the values

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
And for an ungraspable time

One was up where it should be down
As a clone, illegally conceived
