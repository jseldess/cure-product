('down', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

in a sharp downward turn 
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

In a sharp downard turn
I’m simply inside

to the down arrow
Right now I’m the cart

I brought my head down
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
where I’m watching my tv
