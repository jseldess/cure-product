('down', 'On')

in a sharp downward turn 
On a snow day with my children

In a sharp downard turn
One day there is direction

to the down arrow
One year or

I brought my head down
On the bandwidth I was on

which I brought down with qualities
On the timeline I was on

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
One was up where it should be down
