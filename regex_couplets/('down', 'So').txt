('down', 'so')

in a sharp downward turn 
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

In a sharp downard turn
When I want something

to the down arrow
Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type

I brought my head down
A person from a distance

which I brought down with qualities
or an available resource

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
so that nothing had gravity
