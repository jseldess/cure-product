('down', 'There')

in a sharp downward turn 
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

to the down arrow
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I brought my head down
There was very little physical activity

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
There are constant ways
