('down', 'across')

in a sharp downward turn 
Before we walk across the wide field

In a sharp downard turn
Before we walk across the wide opening

It keeps coming down thankfully
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

to the down arrow
across the retinas

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
over the roof of the buildings across the alley
