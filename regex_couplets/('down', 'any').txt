('down', 'any')

in a sharp downward turn 
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

In a sharp downard turn
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

to the down arrow
Or the company

which I brought down with qualities
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

One was up where it should be down
without any further damage
