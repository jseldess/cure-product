('down', 'children')

in a sharp downward turn 
On a snow day with my children

In a sharp downard turn
about my childrenâ€™s consumption

It keeps coming down thankfully
only fragments of time with my children

to the down arrow
Even the children

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
my possession of my children
