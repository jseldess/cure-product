('down', 'do')

in a sharp downward turn 
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

In a sharp downard turn
It keeps coming down thankfully

to the down arrow
the down arrow

sudden downward turn
The dogs and lillies

I brought my head down
I brought my qualities down

which I brought down with qualities
I put my bread down

I brought my count down
I put my head down

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
One was up where it should be down
