('down', 'earn')

in a sharp downward turn 
in light of learning what we see

to the down arrow
When we had jobs that were to earn

I brought my head down
I spend time online learning to code

which I brought down with qualities
learned without too much difficulty to code

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
decisioned to learn
