('down', 'eat')

in a sharp downward turn 
too sunny to eat ice cream

In a sharp downard turn
I reach repeated expressions first

It keeps coming down thankfully
I propogated repeated expressions first

to the down arrow
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I brought my head down
Where I put it beating

which I brought down with qualities
executive breath

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
was not just a defeat
