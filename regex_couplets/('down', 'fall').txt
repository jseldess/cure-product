('down', 'fall')

in a sharp downward turn 
Then fall then summer from my face

In a sharp downard turn
and not falling at all

It keeps coming down thankfully
Then fall then summer

to the down arrow
Face falling off the edge of the face

I brought my head down
The value falling off the edge of th face

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
