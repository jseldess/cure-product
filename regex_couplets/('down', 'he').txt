('down', 'he')

in a sharp downward turn 
where I sleep at times

In a sharp downard turn
Then fall then summer from my face

It keeps coming down thankfully
Then fall then summer

to the down arrow
Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times

the down arrow
drifting away from the task

sudden downward turn
The South Carolina primary 

I brought my head down
and my heart rate

I brought my qualities down
Where official policy is to catch and release

which I brought down with qualities
In a continuous theme

I put my bread down
I put my head down

I brought my count down
and could be mapped and weighed

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
They can be waived

One was up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes
