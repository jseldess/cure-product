('down', 'here')

in a sharp downward turn 
where I sleep at times

In a sharp downard turn
Of course there is a direction

to the down arrow
That’s where I sleep at times

the down arrow
I’ll get there eventually

I brought my head down
Where official policy is to catch and release

I brought my qualities down
Where I put it beating

which I brought down with qualities
I’ll get there ruins

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
One was up where it should be down
