('down', 'if')

in a sharp downward turn 
drifting away

In a sharp downard turn
if not directly on my skin

to the down arrow
drifting away from the task

sudden downward turn
if you have providence to excess

I brought my head down
out of the fifth page ruins

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
if there is anything
