in a sharp downward turn 
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

In a sharp downard turn

hold at intervals riding forward

which I brought down with qualities
at intervals while riding forward

I brought my qualities down
high up in the internet

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
Then I saw them interview
