('down', 'pull')

in a sharp downward turn 
I’ll pull myself another personality type

to the down arrow
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

I brought my head down
fish pulled out of the lake

I brought my qualities down
I’ll pull myself higher up

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
