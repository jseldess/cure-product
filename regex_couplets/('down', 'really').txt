('down', 'really')

in a sharp downward turn 
because it was really dark

In a sharp downard turn
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

to the down arrow
When they really take hold of my finger

which I brought down with qualities
That’s when they really take

I brought my head down
without really agreeing
