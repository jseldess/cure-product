('down', 'time.')

in a sharp downward turn 
where I sleep at times

In a sharp downard turn
only fragments of time with my children

to the down arrow
Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times

the down arrow
over the long time up in the sky

I brought my head down
I spend time online learning to code

which I brought down with qualities
On the timeline I was on

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
or alter of course the time anyway
