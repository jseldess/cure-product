('down', 'up?')

in a sharp downward turn 
an impure product

In a sharp downard turn
Then fall then summer from my face

It keeps coming down thankfully
Then fall then summer

to the down arrow
sudden downward turn

I brought my head down
I brought my qualities down

which I brought down with qualities
in a continuous vertiginous dream

I put my bread down
I brought my count down

I put my head down
and could be mapped and weighed

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I tell you my purposes

One was up where it should be down
And for an ungraspable time
