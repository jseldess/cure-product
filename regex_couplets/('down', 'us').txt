('down', 'us')

in a sharp downward turn 
asynchronous 

In a sharp downard turn
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

to the down arrow
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I brought my head down
In a vertiginous dream

I brought my qualities down
in a continuous vertiginous dream

which I brought down with qualities
In a continuous theme

I put my bread down
Remnant continuous pages

I brought my count down
The ventillation rushes on

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
a futile joyous white sun
