('down', 'walk')

in a sharp downward turn 
Before we walk across the wide field

In a sharp downard turn
Before we walk across the wide opening

It keeps coming down thankfully
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

to the down arrow
there was no walking along the pleasure

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
