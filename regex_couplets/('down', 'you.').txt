('down', 'you.')

in a sharp downward turn 
Though how can you know without direction

to the down arrow
You can hear it also through your leisure

I brought my head down
That you can see only the back of

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I tell you my purposes

One was up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes
