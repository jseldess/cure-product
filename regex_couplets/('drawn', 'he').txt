('drawn', 'he')

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
But my not feeling the memory aside

drawn formerly a long time
time they were on

drawn formerly rights blended themselves
dawn formerly nights ended themselves

drawn formerly rights
ended themselves

drawn formerly rights ended themselves
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

drawn formerly along 
formerly along time they were on
