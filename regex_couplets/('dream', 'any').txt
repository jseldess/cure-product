('dream', 'any')

In a vertiginous dream
Or the company

in a continuous vertiginous dream
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

Then I continue to dream then
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I could consume the dream
without any further damage

I continued to dream then
without any longer damage
