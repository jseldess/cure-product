('dream', 'do')

In a vertiginous dream
I brought my head down

in a continuous vertiginous dream
I brought my qualities down

Then I continue to dream then
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I could consume the dream
around the dogs and lillies

I continued to dream then
here is the site of the battle of maldon
