('dream', 'he')

In a vertiginous dream
Then the sun isnâ€™t up

in a continuous vertiginous dream
and my heart rate

Then I continue to dream then
I could consume the dream

Then I continued to dream then
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

Then I continued to dream
Under the last seen principle

I continued to dream then
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
