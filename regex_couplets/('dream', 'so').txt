('dream', 'so')

In a vertiginous dream
A person from a distance

in a continuous vertiginous dream
or an available resource

Then I continue to dream then
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I could consume the dream
so that nothing had gravity

I continued to dream then
some sort of a futile joyous white sun
