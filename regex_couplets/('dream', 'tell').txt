('dream', 'tell')

In a vertiginous dream
The CEO tells me to embody values

in a continuous vertiginous dream
I had to tell them the news

Then I continue to dream then
I tell you my purposes

I could consume the dream
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I continued to dream then
So I constellate the time family country
