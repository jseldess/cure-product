('drift', 'eat')

drifting away
too sunny to eat ice cream

drifting does not feel an exception
But I can’t let myself treat 

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to treat others

at any time it can drift again
I let myself treat

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

drifting away from the task
executive breath
