('drifting', 'drift')

drifting away
drifting does not feel an exception

drifting away needs others presume desires
at any time it can drift again

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
For whom drifting is not an exception

the drifting is not something special
Walt Whitman drifted

drifting away needs
drifting away from the task

in a moment of drifting away from the task
