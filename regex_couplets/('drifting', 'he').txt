('drifting', 'he')

drifting away
Before we walk across the wide field

drifting does not feel an exception
The dogs and lillies

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I canâ€™t presume to need others

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting is not an exception
without imparting the cynicism

the drifting is not something special
Then I cannot see face value

drifting away needs
There are quarterly goals

drifting away from the task
in a moment of drifting away from the task
