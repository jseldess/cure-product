('drifting', 'here')

drifting away
Of course there is a direction

drifting does not feel an exception
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

drifting away needs others presume desires
where I sleep at times

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
There are quarterly goals

drifting away from the task
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
