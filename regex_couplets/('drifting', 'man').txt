('drifting', 'man')

drifting away
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

drifting does not feel an exception
To my children Walt Whitman

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Walt Whitman

For whom drifting is not an exception
What Whitman

the drifting is not something special
Walt Whitman drifted

drifting away needs
There are performance reviews

drifting away needs others presume desires
not many face up
