('drifting', 'so')

drifting away
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

drifting does not feel an exception
You can hear it also through your leisure

drifting away needs others presume desires
reasons resources

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
who are so fresh and agile

the drifting is not something special
Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type

drifting away needs
soft paper

drifting away from the task
solvents
