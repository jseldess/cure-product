('drifting', 'time.')

drifting away
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

drifting does not feel an exception
where I sleep at times

drifting away needs others presume desires
at any time it can drift again

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting is not an exception
over the long time up in the sky

drifting away needs
That’s where I sleep at times

drifting away from the task
So I constellate the time family country
