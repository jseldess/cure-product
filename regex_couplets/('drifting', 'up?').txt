('drifting', 'up?')

drifting away
asynchronous 

drifting does not feel an exception
The sun isn’t up

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to need others

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting is not an exception
But not to impart cynicism

the drifting is not something special
Puffs of air

drifting away needs
There are quarterly goals

drifting away from the task
sudden downward turn
