('economic', 'he')

of my economic value
upsent in the afternoon

of the economic value my habits
of the habits I create

of the economic value
out in the snow

I can see only the back of their economic value
Their economic value

increasingly that their economic value
is a function of the strength

that their economic value 
of the habits they create.

between cereal and economic
my ethereal economic relations
