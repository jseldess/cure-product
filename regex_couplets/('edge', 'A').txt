('edge', 'A')

I step off the edge
Arrayed out in such a nested way

off the edge of the world
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Face falling off the edge of the face
All of the time

The edge is put in place
As though stationary and a destination

The edge isnâ€™t even there
And put in place as though stationary

I step over the edge
And as an extension of the values

value falling off the edge of the face
And make myself a visible

Falling off the edge of the face
After having been contented

The value falling off the edge of th face
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

and testing the edge and gravity
Aspirational strategy
