('edge', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

I step off the edge
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Face falling off the edge of the face
I’m simply inside

The edge is put in place
Right now I’m the cart

value falling off the edge of the face
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

and testing the edge and gravity
where I’m watching my tv
