('edge', 'It')

I step off the edge
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

Face falling off the edge of the face
It keeps coming down thankfully

The edge is put in place
It has been since

off the edge of the world
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

and testing the edge and gravity
It’s not marshal exactly
