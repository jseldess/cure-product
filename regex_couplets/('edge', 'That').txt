('edge', 'That')

I step off the edge
That’s exaclty what I want for them

The edge is put in place
That is itself not still

The edge isn’t even there
That’s where I sleep at times

off the edge of the world
That’s when they really take

Falling off the edge of the face
That you can see only the back of

and testing the edge and gravity
That company creates a life
