('edge', 'There')

I step off the edge
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

The edge is put in place
There are quarterly goals

off the edge of the world
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Falling off the edge of the face
There was very little physical activity
