('edge', 'though')

I step off the edge
As though stationary and a destination

The edge isnâ€™t even there
And put in place as though stationary

I step over the edge
though there are quarters with goals

If I step on the edge
though it was most emphatically that

off the edge of the world
I had nightmares though
