('edge', 'act')

I step off the edge
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Face falling off the edge of the face
In the retroactive light

value falling off the edge of the face
of retroactive observations

The edge is put in place
I was enjoined to act again myself

off the edge of the world
I was enjoined to act again

Falling off the edge of the face
and strategies not tactics

and testing the edge and gravity
Not goals or tactics
