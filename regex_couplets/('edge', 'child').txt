('edge', 'child')

I step off the edge
On a snow day with my children

Face falling off the edge of the face
about my childrenâ€™s consumption

value falling off the edge of the face
especially in a child

The edge is put in place
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

off the edge of the world
even my child
