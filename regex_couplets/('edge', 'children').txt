('edge', 'children')

I step off the edge
On a snow day with my children

Face falling off the edge of the face
about my childrenâ€™s consumption

value falling off the edge of the face
only fragments of time with my children

The edge is put in place
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

off the edge of the world
Even the children
