('edge', 'code')

I step off the edge
as long as I have access to the code

The edge is put in place
May I have your zip code

off the edge of the world
I spend time online learning to code

Falling off the edge of the face
learned without too much difficulty to code

and testing the edge and gravity
falling off the encoded end
