('edge', 'direction')

I step off the edge
into rotating directionless 

off the edge of the world
Of course there is a direction

The edge is put in place
in rotating directionless space

I step over the edge
into rotating and directionless space

If I step on the edge
and then into rotating and directional space

If I step over the edge
into directionless space

Face falling off the edge of the face
stopping off in all directions
