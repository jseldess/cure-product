('edge', 'do')

I step off the edge
The dogs and lillies

off the edge of the world
in a sharp downward turn 

Face falling off the edge of the face
In a sharp downard turn

value falling off the edge of the face
It keeps coming down thankfully

The edge is put in place
does not feel an exception

Falling off the edge of the face
I brought my head down

The value falling off the edge of th face
So that I donâ€™t notice I am the only one

and testing the edge and gravity
What I do in my liesure
