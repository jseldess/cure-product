('edge', 'down')

I step off the edge
in a sharp downward turn 

Face falling off the edge of the face
In a sharp downard turn

value falling off the edge of the face
It keeps coming down thankfully

The edge is put in place
to the down arrow

off the edge of the world
I brought my head down

Falling off the edge of the face
I click my zipcode up where it should be down
