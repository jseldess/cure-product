('edge', 'earn')

I step off the edge
in light of learning what we see

The edge is put in place
When we had jobs that were to earn

off the edge of the world
I spend time online learning to code

Falling off the edge of the face
learned without too much difficulty to code

and testing the edge and gravity
where you can earn more
