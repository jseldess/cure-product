('edge', 'goals')

I step off the edge
Though there are quarters goals

The edge is put in place
We can wrestle them with their goals

I step over the edge
though there are quarters with goals

If I step on the edge
and without quartely goals

off the edge of the world
There are quarterly goals

Face falling off the edge of the face
before morning goals

and testing the edge and gravity
not goals
