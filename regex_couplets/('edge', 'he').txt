('edge', 'he')

I step off the edge
into the stream of pictures

off the edge of the world
Before we walk across the wide field

Face falling off the edge of the face
value falling off the edge of the face

The edge is put in place
The edge isn’t even there

I step over the edge
though there are quarters with goals

If I step on the edge
and then into rotating and directional space

If I step over the edge
what I find there

Falling off the edge of the face
Then

The value falling off the edge of the face
over the long time up in the sky

The value falling off the edge of th face
over the time line I was on

and testing the edge and gravity
What’s the next step
