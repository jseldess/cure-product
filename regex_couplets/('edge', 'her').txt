('edge', 'her')

I step off the edge
Where I sleep at times

off the edge of the world
I’ll get there eventually

Face falling off the edge of the face
Of course there is a direction

The edge is put in place
The edge isn’t even there

I step over the edge
though there are quarters with goals

If I step on the edge
what I find there

value falling off the edge of the face
There are quarterly goals

Falling off the edge of the face
I’ll pull myself another personality type

The value falling off the edge of the face
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

The value falling off the edge of th face
there was no promotion
