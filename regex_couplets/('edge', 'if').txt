('edge', 'if')

I step off the edge
drifting away

Face falling off the edge of the face
if not directly on my skin

The edge is put in place
drifting does not feel an exception

off the edge of the world
drifting away needs

value falling off the edge of the face
if you have providence to excess

Falling off the edge of the face
learned without too much difficulty to code

and testing the edge and gravity
That company creates a life
