('edge', 'inter')

I step off the edge
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Face falling off the edge of the face
interjecting on a day ambition

The edge is put in place
way high up in the inter

Falling off the edge of the face
higher up in the internet

The value falling off the edge of the face
hold at intervals riding forward

off the edge of the world
at intervals while riding forward

The value falling off the edge of th face
with internally regulated climate

and testing the edge and gravity
Then I saw them interview
