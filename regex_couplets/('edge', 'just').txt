('edge', 'just')

I step off the edge
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

The edge is put in place
Theyâ€™re just not mine

If I step on the edge
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

off the edge of the world
was not just a defeat

Falling off the edge of the face
I just got a letter

and testing the edge and gravity
it was not just a defeat
