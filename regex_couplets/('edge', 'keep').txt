('edge', 'keep')

I step off the edge
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

Face falling off the edge of the face
It keeps coming down thankfully

The edge is put in place
I keep turning back again myself

off the edge of the world
I keep turning back

Falling off the edge of the face
