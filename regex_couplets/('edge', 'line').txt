('edge', 'line')

I step off the edge
on the time line I was on

Falling off the edge of the face
over the time line I was on

off the edge of the world
I spend time online learning to code

Face falling off the edge of the face
over the long line up in the sky

and testing the edge and gravity
The days lined along company
