('edge', 'now')

I step off the edge
On a snow day with my children

Face falling off the edge of the face
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

The edge is put in place
Though how can you know without direction

I step over the edge
for how can you know without direction

If I step over the edge
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

value falling off the edge of the face
out in the snow

off the edge of the world
out in the snow fall

and testing the edge and gravity
out in the snow falling face value
