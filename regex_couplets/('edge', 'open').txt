('edge', 'open')

I step off the edge
Before we walk across the wide opening

Face falling off the edge of the face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

The edge is put in place
my desires were open

off the edge of the world
I wish my desires were open

Falling off the edge of the face
The simple act opening surmounted
