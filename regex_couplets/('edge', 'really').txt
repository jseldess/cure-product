('edge', 'really')

I step off the edge
because it was really dark

Face falling off the edge of the face
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

The edge is put in place
When they really take hold of my finger

off the edge of the world
That’s when they really take

Falling off the edge of the face
without really agreeing
