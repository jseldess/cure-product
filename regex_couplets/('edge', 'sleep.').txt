('edge', 'sleep.')

I step off the edge
Where I sleep at times

off the edge of the world
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Face falling off the edge of the face
That’s where I sleep at times

value falling off the edge of the face
Interrupted sleep or

Falling off the edge of the face
like flattening sleep
