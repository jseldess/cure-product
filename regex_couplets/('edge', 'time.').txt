('edge', 'time.')

I step off the edge
Where I sleep at times

off the edge of the world
Then I constellate my time family country

Face falling off the edge of the face
only fragments of time with my children

The edge is put in place
at any time it can drift again

value falling off the edge of the face
over the long time up in the sky

Falling off the edge of the face
on the time line I was on

The value falling off the edge of the face
over the time line I was on

The value falling off the edge of th face
over the long time I was on

and testing the edge and gravity
The long time I had a vision
