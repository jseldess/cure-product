('edge', 'told')

I step off the edge
I told her a story, she drew waves.

Face falling off the edge of the face
I am told ventillation

Falling off the edge of the face
I am told by no ventillation

off the edge of the world
I am told by the ventillation

and testing the edge and gravity
which ran to be told
