('edge', 'too')

I step off the edge
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

Face falling off the edge of the face
emerging this year from too much standing water

off the edge of the world
learned without too much difficulty to code

and testing the edge and gravity
Selma knows too
