('edge', 'up?')

I step off the edge
I assumed it was visible

off the edge of the world
I’ll get there eventually

Face falling off the edge of the face
value falling off the edge of the face

The edge is put in place
As though stationary and a destination

The edge isn’t even there
And put in place as though stationary

I step over the edge
though there are quarters with goals

If I step on the edge
for how can you know without direction

If I step over the edge
slow asynchronous

Falling off the edge of the face
The value falling off the edge of the face

The value falling off the edge of th face
over the long time up in the sky

and testing the edge and gravity
of my economic value
