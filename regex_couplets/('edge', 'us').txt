('edge', 'us')

I step off the edge
I suspend live connections to you

off the edge of the world
asynchronous 

Face falling off the edge of the face
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

The edge is put in place
russling to stay still

I step over the edge
Theyâ€™re just not mine

If I step on the edge
slow asynchronous

value falling off the edge of the face
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Falling off the edge of the face
I want to cite a poem so usual

The value falling off the edge of th face
The ventillation rushes on

and testing the edge and gravity
So stay with us
