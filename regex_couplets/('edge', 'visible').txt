('edge', 'visible')

I step off the edge
I assumed it was visible

off the edge of the world
Iâ€™ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

Face falling off the edge of the face
And make myself a visible

Falling off the edge of the face
Divisible or

The value falling off the edge of th face
I assume the offers divisible
