('edge', 'When')

I step off the edge
When I woke up in the morning

Face falling off the edge of the face
When I want something

The edge is put in place
When we had jobs that were to earn

off the edge of the world
When they really take hold of my finger

Falling off the edge of the face
When closed to my knowing
