('edge', 'you.')

I step off the edge
Though how can you know without direction

I step over the edge
for how can you know without direction

If I step over the edge
You can hear it also through your leisure

off the edge of the world
if you have providence to excess

Falling off the edge of the face
That you can see only the back of

and testing the edge and gravity
your bid to the next highest ranked network
