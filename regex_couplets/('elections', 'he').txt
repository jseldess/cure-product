on my way to elections
I speak them of my possessions

formerly my way to the elections
on a way to the elections

formally a way to the elections
formerly along time they were on

formerly along my say to the elections

My say to the elections
the right of my elections

I stay the right of my elections
to the right of a surcharge

The right of incurred elections
The right of interned elections

To the right of determined elections
To the right of interned possessions

determined by elections
To the right of deterred elections

To the right of interned elections
to the right of possessions
