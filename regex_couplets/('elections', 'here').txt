('elections', 'here')

on my way to elections
Where in me did I host

formerly my way to the elections
where rights ended themselves

on a way to the elections
By my memory elsewhere

formally a way to the elections
my ethereal economic relations

I stay the right of my elections
I learned the point where I am
