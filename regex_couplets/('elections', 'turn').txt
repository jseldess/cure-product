('elections', 'turn')

on my way to elections
who knows how to turn it off

formerly my way to the elections
I turn not sad exactly

on a way to the elections
I return not sad exactly

I stay the right of my elections
I returned not sad exactly

The right of incurred elections
to return what I bought
