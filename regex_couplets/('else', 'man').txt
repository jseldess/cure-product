('else', 'man')

If you have confidence regardless all else
not many face up

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

and elsewhere my memory
They have very many choices

elsewhere my purposes
and that man comes on to tell me 

elsewhere by my memory
The many transparent pixel calls

By my memory elsewhere
