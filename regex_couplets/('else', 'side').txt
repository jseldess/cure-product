('else', 'side')

If you have confidence regardless all else
aside from the retinas

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
But my not feeling the memory aside

and elsewhere my memory 
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

elsewhere by my memory
But my not feeling the memory inside

By my memory elsewhere
where I send and relive aside

in memory elsewhere
