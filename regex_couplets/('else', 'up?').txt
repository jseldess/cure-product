('else', 'up?')

If you have confidence regardless all else
upset by Gingrich

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
While weâ€™re up in the sky 

and elsewhere my memory
The South Carolina primary 

and elsewhere my memory of you
I have entered my purchases

elsewhere my purposes
washed my purchases

elsewhere by my memory
answered about 

By my memory elsewhere
I answered about

in memory elsewhere
radiating from housing

but for memory elsewhere
I answered what I thought

in memory persisting elsewhere
I answered what I thought about
