('elsewhere', 'entered')

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I have entered my purposes

and elsewhere my memory of you
I have entered my purchases

and elsewhere my memory 
entered into my purposes

elsewhere my purposes
I have entered my phone

elsewhere by my memory
I had entered my phone

By my memory elsewhere
