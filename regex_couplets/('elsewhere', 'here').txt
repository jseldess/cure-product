('elsewhere', 'here')

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
there wasn’t any television 

and elsewhere my memory
and elsewhere my memory of you

elsewhere my purposes
where I send and relive would be held

elsewhere by my memory
Where in me did I loose

By my memory elsewhere
after though there’s no memory

in memory elsewhere
but for memory elsewhere

in memory persisting elsewhere
where rights ended themselves
