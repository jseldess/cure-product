('elsewhere', 'so')

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
so that nothing had gravity

and elsewhere my memory
More reasons around my country 

and elsewhere my memory of you
sound inundated for my own purchases

elsewhere by my memory
so still watch them

By my memory elsewhere
so still them

in memory elsewhere
buy in the sound privacy
