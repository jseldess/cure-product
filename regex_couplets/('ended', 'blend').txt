('ended', 'blend')

I am to end my connections suspended live
battery dawn nights blending themselves

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
where lights blended themselves

where rights ended themselves
where I blend and relive

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

drawn formerly rights blended themselves
