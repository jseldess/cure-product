('ended', 'he')

I am to end my connections suspended live
But that is beside the point

Suspended live in connections to you
Where I sleep at times

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
where rights ended themselves

where lights blended themselves
time they were on

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

dawn formerly rights blended themselves
drawn formerly rights blended themselves

dawn formerly nights ended themselves
ended themselves

drawn formerly rights ended themselves
formerly along time they were on
