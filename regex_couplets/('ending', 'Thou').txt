('ending', 'Thou')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Though there are quarters goals

I tried to feel the key values extending 
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Though in not many acts

talking into percents bending themselves
Though we are waiting for her

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
Though we are waiting 

battery dawn nights ending themselves
