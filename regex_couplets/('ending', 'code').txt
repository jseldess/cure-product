('ending', 'code')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
as long as I have access to the code

I tried to feel the key values extending 
falling off the encoded end

talking into pheasants bending themselves
encoded off the end

talking into percents bending themselves
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
zipcode

battery dawn nights ending themselves
