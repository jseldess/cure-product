('ending', 'ink')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
ink

I tried to feel the key values extending 
all that I can think I want

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

talking into percents bending themselves
I only think I don’t listen
