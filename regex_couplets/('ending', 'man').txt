('ending', 'man')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

I tried to feel the key values extending 
not many face up

talking into pheasants bending themselves
though not many facts up in the sky

talking into percents bending themselves
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
and that man comes on to tell me 

battery dawn nights ending themselves
