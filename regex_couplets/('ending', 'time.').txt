('ending', 'time.')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
only fragments of time with my children

I tried to feel the key values extending 
The long time I had a vision

talking into pheasants bending themselves
without the long time I was accounting

talking into percents bending themselves
which is the long time I was on

walking into percents blending themselves
the long time I was on

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
until a happier time found

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in the long time they were on
