('ending', 'tire')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

talking into pheasants bending themselves
until I could not tire 

talking into percents bending themselves
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
