('ending', 'you.')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Though how can you know without direction

I tried to feel the key values extending 
That you can see only the back of

talking into pheasants bending themselves
where you can earn more 

talking into percents bending themselves
a futile joyous white sun

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
the young ripples inaudibly
