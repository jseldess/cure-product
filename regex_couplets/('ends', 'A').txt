('ends', 'A')

to the ends of my transactions
And we could inhabit the room easy

The ends of my transactions
CONTRACT

To the ends of transactions
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR WITH A RUBBY DUCKY)

to the ends of actions
A baby and a bear

to the ends
A way formerly like this one

with her ways to the ends
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

with her way to the ends
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

The other ends of my transactions
A way I was going
