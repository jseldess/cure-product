('ends', 'he')

to the ends of my transactions
I have a memory between the day

The ends of my transactions
I speak to them

To the ends of transactions
though we are waiting for her

to the ends of actions
the way was water

to the ends
The way that I am going

with her ways to the ends
But my not feeling the memory inside

with her way to the ends
Selma helps too

The other ends of my transactions
There are no constant ways
