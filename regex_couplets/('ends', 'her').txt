('ends', 'her')

to the ends of my transactions
Where in me did I host

The ends of my transactions
where I send and relive

To the ends of transactions
though we are waiting for her

to the ends of actions
with her waves

to the ends
My daughter with her way

with her ways to the ends
with her way to the ends

The other ends of my transactions
There are no constant ways
