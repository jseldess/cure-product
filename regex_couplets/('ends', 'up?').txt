('ends', 'up?')

to the ends of my transactions
We had inhabited actually

The ends of my transactions
breaking from my constituents

To the ends of transactions
though we are waiting for her

to the ends of actions
I end up in Bach 

to the ends
But my not feeling the memory inside

with her ways to the ends
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

with her way to the ends
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

The other ends of my transactions
I stand and retrieve and pulse around
