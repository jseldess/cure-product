('enjoined', 'so')

I was enjoined to act again myself
soft paper

I was enjoined to act again
or an available resource

I was enjoined to act
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I am enjoined to act again
My associations

I was enjoined to act against
with little reason to move
