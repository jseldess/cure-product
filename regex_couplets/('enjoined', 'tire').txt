('enjoined', 'tire')

I was enjoined to act again myself
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I am enjoined to act again
The entire company

I was enjoined to act
Since I had to hold the entire company

I was enjoined to act against
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
