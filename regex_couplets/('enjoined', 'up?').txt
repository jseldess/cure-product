('enjoined', 'up?')

I was enjoined to act again myself
The South Carolina primary 

I was enjoined to act again
before the sunâ€™s deflections

I was enjoined to act
I argued the days were longer

I am enjoined to act again
And as an extension of the values

I was enjoined to act against
with full potential to movement
