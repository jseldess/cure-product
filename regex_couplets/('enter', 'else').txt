('enter', 'else')

I have entered my phone
If you have confidence regardless all else

The sun high enough to enter directly 
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I have entered my purposes
and elsewhere my memory of you

I have entered my purchases
and elsewhere my memory 

entered into my purposes
elsewhere my purposes

I had entered my phone
By my memory elsewhere
