('enter', 'up?')

I have entered my phone
In a sharp downard turn

The sun high enough to enter directly 
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

I enter the flattening mirror
under pillowing a cloud

I have entered my purposes
and elsewhere my memory of you

I have entered my purchases
Then I saw into you

entered into my purposes
data collection on users

I had entered my phone
I answered about
