('enter', 'you.')

I have entered my phone
Though how can you know without direction

The sun high enough to enter directly 
If you have confidence regardless all else

I enter the flattening mirror
a futile joyous white sun

I have entered my purposes
This is your chance

I have entered my purchases
the young ripples inaudibly
