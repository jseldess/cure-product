('entered', 'he')

I have entered my phone
Before we walk across the wide opening

I have entered my purposes
and elsewhere my memory of you

I have entered my purchases
Then I saw into you

entered into my purposes
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

I had entered my phone
battery dawn nights blending themselves
