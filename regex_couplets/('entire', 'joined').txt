('entire', 'joined')

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
I was enjoined to act again myself

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
I am enjoined to act again

The entire company
I was enjoined to act

Since I had to hold the entire company
I was enjoined to act against

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
joined in my television
