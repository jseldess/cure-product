('entire', 'up?')

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
And as an extension of the values

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
I agrued the days were longer

The entire company
but it continued

Since I had to hold the entire company
I argued the days were longer

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
with full potential to movement
