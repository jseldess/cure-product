('even', 'code')

I’ll get there eventually
as long as I have access to the code

The edge isn’t even there
May I have your zip code

results eventually
learned without too much difficulty to code

I even know what I would find
falling off the encoded end

even when close to my owning
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
zipcode
