('even', 'he')

I’ll get there eventually
Then I constellate my time family country

The edge isn’t even there
Rather it itself is rotating

or not even rotating
If I step over the edge

not even rotating
what I find there

eventually 
high up in the internet

results eventually
Then I cannot see face value

I even know what I would find
will not be the same

even when close to my owning
I get from here through there

even when close to my knowing
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

even when closed
When closed to my knowing

even my child
Up in the sky

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses

people would prevent
in the face that I had
