('even', 'know')

I’ll get there eventually
who knows the way

The edge isn’t even there
Though how can you know without direction

or not even rotating
for how can you know without direction

not even rotating
I even know what I would find

even when close to my owning
even when close to my knowing

even when closed
When closed to my knowing

even my child
knowing the constituents
