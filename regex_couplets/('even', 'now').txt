('even', 'now')

I’ll get there eventually
On a snow day with my children

The edge isn’t even there
Though how can you know without direction

or not even rotating
for how can you know without direction

not even rotating
Right now I’m the cart

eventually 
out in the snow

results eventually
out in the snow fall

I even know what I would find
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

even when close to my owning
even when close to my knowing

even when closed
When closed to my knowing

even my child
knowing the constituents
