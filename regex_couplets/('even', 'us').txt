('even', 'us')

I’ll get there eventually
asynchronous 

The edge isn’t even there
russling to stay still

or not even rotating
slow asynchronous

eventually 
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

results eventually
The ventillation rushes on

I even know what I would find
I refuse indelible tracts

even when close to my owning
a futile joyous white sun

even my child
articles all around us

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

people would prevent
in the form filled offered in trust
