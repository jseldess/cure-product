('exception', 'he')

as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
The dogs and lillies

does not feel an exception
others desires

drifting does not feel an exception
The sun isnâ€™t up

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting is not an exception
without imparting the cynicism
