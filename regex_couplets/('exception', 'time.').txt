('exception', 'time.')

as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
Itâ€™s time to wake up, Papa!

does not feel an exception
where I sleep at times

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting is not an exception
over the long time up in the sky
