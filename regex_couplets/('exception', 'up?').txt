('exception', 'up?')

as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
I assumed it was visible

does not feel an exception
but not impart cynicism

drifting does not feel an exception
The sun isnâ€™t up

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting is not an exception
But not to impart cynicism
