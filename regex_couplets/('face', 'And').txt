('face', 'And')

Then I cannot see face value
And put in place as though stationary

Falling from my face
And as an extension of the values

Face falling off the edge of the face
And make myself a visible

Falling off the edge of the face
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

black spots on a white surface
And we had to say goodbye to her there

white spots on a black surface
And we could inhabit the room easy

in the face that I had
