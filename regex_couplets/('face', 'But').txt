('face', 'but')

Then I cannot see face value
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
but not impart cynicism

Falling from my face
Attributable or

Falling off the edge of the face
but the sun isn’t up

out in the snow falling face value
but it continued

white spots on a black surface
but would I love her the same

black spots on a white surface
but I can hear them

in the face that I had
that decisions can be attributable

stopped light with validated faces
but for memory elsewhere
