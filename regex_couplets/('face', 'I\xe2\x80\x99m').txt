('face', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

Then I cannot see face value
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
I’m simply inside

Falling from my face
Right now I’m the cart

Face falling off the edge of the face
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

out in the snow falling face value
where I’m watching my tv

my interfaced stand data
