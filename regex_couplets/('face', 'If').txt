('face', 'if')

Then I cannot see face value
drifting away

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
if not directly on my skin

Falling from my face
drifting away needs

Face falling off the edge of the face
if you have providence to excess

Falling off the edge of the face
learned without too much difficulty to code

out in the snow falling face value
That company creates a life

white spots on a black surface
If I take a different measure

black spots on a white surface
If I take some different measure

not many face up
if there is anything 

in the face that I had
if that has anything

in the face that it had
if only on the way to the trash
