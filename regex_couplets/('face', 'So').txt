('face', 'so')

Then I cannot see face value
Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
When I want something

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling from my face
reasons resources

Face falling off the edge of the face
soft paper

Falling off the edge of the face
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

out in the snow falling face value
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

white spots on a black surface
If I take some different measure

black spots on a white surface
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

not many face up
I cannot clear it also through investiture

in the face that I had
sound inundated for my own purchases

in the face that it had
so still watch them

stopped light with validated faces
firing and connecting somewhere

my interfaced stand data
buy in the sound privacy
