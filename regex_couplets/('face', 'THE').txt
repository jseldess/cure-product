('face', 'THE')

Then I cannot see face value
THE SNOW

Falling from my face
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

Falling off the edge of the face
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

out in the snow falling face value
THE OFFERS

white spots on a black surface
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

black spots on a white surface
