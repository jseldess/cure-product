('face', 'There')

Then I cannot see face value
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
There are quarterly goals

Falling from my face
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Falling off the edge of the face
There was very little physical activity

white spots on a black surface
There are spots waiting

black spots on a white surface
There are constant ways

stopped light with validated faces
