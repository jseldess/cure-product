('face', 'To')

Then I cannot see face value
To my children Walt Whitman

Falling from my face
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

Falling off the edge of the face
Tomorrow

out in the snow falling face value
Toward the start informally given my reasons

black spots on a white surface
To neither study

in the face that I had
To the ends of transactions

stopped light with validated faces
To the right of determined elections
