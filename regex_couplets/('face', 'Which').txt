('face', 'Which')

Then I cannot see face value
Which is a measure to never live out

Falling from my face
Which can be pronounced to the world

Falling off the edge of the face
Which is a pleasure to never live out

black spots on a white surface
Which can be called confidence

in the face that I had
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

in the face that it had
