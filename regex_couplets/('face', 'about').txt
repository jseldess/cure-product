('face', 'about')

Then I cannot see face value
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

Between the face of pure joy and an interface.
about my childrenâ€™s consumption

Falling from my face
burrowed about from repeated travels

in the face that it had
answered about 

stopped light with validated faces
I answered about

my interfaced stand data
which I feel formerly about for

I interfaced
I answered what I thought about
