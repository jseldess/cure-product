('face', 'across')

Then I cannot see face value
Before we walk across the wide field

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Before we walk across the wide opening

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Before anyone walks across the opening

Falling from my face
across the retinas

white spots on a black surface
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

black spots on a white surface
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
