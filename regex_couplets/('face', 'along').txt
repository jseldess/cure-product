('face', 'along')

Then I cannot see face value
bring your child along

Falling from my face
The days lined along company

white spots on a black surface
there was no walking along the pleasure

black spots on a white surface
formerly along time they were on

stopped light with validated faces
along cables

my interfaced stand data
shone formerly along time
