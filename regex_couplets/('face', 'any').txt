('face', 'any')

Then I cannot see face value
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Before anyone walks across the opening

Falling from my face
at any time it can drift again

Face falling off the edge of the face
Or the company

Falling off the edge of the face
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

white spots on a black surface
there wasn’t any television 

black spots on a white surface
not many face up

though not many face up
though not many freeze up

in the face that I had
latency which doesn’t mean anything

in the face that it had
The many transparent pixel calls

stopped light with validated faces
or imagined anyway
