('face', 'are')

Then I cannot see face value
Though there are quarters goals

Falling from my face
There are quarterly goals

Face falling off the edge of the face
barely outlines

out in the snow falling face value
They are called aspirational

white spots on a black surface
but they are black spots

black spots on a white surface
I believe I can prepare for it

not many face up
There are spots waiting

in the face that I had
though we are still breaking in

in the face that it had
still carefully

stopped light with validated faces
That are my right to say
