('face', 'away')

Then I cannot see face value
drifting away

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
drifting away needs others presume desires

Falling from my face
drifting away needs

Face falling off the edge of the face
Who throws contours away

stopped light with validated faces
