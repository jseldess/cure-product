('face', 'Before')

Then I cannot see face value
Before we walk across the wide field

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Before we walk across the wide opening

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Before anyone walks across the opening

Falling from my face
Before morning goals

out in the snow falling face value
