('face', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

Then I cannot see face value
I can’t fix them without direction

Falling from my face
Then I can’t presume to need others

Face falling off the edge of the face
That can’t be glimpsed

white spots on a black surface
Though we can’t help waiting

stopped light with validated faces
I can’t remember them
