('face', 'children')

Then I cannot see face value
On a snow day with my children

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
my children’s consumption

Then fall then summer from my face
about my children’s consumption

Falling from my face
only fragments of time with my children

Face falling off the edge of the face
Even the children

black spots on a white surface
my possession of my children

in the face that it had
speech my possession of my children

stopped light with validated faces
