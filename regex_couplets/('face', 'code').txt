('face', 'code')

Then I cannot see face value
as long as I have access to the code

Falling from my face
May I have your zip code

Falling off the edge of the face
learned without too much difficulty to code

out in the snow falling face value
falling off the encoded end

white spots on a black surface
encoded off the end

black spots on a white surface
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

in the face that I had
zipcode

stopped light with validated faces
