('face', 'day')

Then I cannot see face value
On a snow day with my children

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
One day there is direction

Falling from my face
I argued the days felt longer

out in the snow falling face value
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

white spots on a black surface
The day

in the face that I had
at least most days

my interfaced stand data
