('face', 'do')

Then I cannot see face value
in a sharp downward turn 

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
In a sharp downard turn

Then fall then summer from my face
It keeps coming down thankfully

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
does not feel an exception

Falling from my face
to the down arrow

Face falling off the edge of the face
The dogs and lillies

Falling off the edge of the face
I brought my head down

The value falling off the edge of th face
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

out in the snow falling face value
What I do in my liesure

white spots on a black surface
I walk up and don’t work anymore

black spots on a white surface
here is the site of the battle of maldon

in the face that I had
and it doesn’t take long

in the face that it had
latency which doesn’t mean anything

stopped light with validated faces
I only think I don’t listen
