('face', 'down')

Then I cannot see face value
in a sharp downward turn 

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
In a sharp downard turn

Then fall then summer from my face
It keeps coming down thankfully

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
to the down arrow

Falling from my face
I brought my head down

Falling off the edge of the face
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

black spots on a white surface
