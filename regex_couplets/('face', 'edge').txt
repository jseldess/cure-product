('face', 'edge')

Then I cannot see face value
off the edge of the world

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Face falling off the edge of the face

value falling off the edge of the face
The edge is put in place

Falling from my face
Falling off the edge of the face

The value falling off the edge of the face
The value falling off the edge of th face

out in the snow falling face value
and testing the edge and gravity

I am not allowed to see their face
