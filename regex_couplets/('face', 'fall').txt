('face', 'fall')

Then I cannot see face value
Then fall then summer from my face

Falling from my face
and not falling at all

Face falling off the edge of the face
value falling off the edge of the face

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Then fall then summer

Falling off the edge of the face
The value falling off the edge of the face

The value falling off the edge of th face
I see only the back of falling values

out in the snow falling face value
out in the snow fall

I am not allowed to see their face
falling off the encoded end

white spots on a black surface
I take it out in the snow fall

black spots on a white surface
falling off the end of the world

not many face up
