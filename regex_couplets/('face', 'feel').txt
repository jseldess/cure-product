('face', 'feel')

Then I cannot see face value
conversations with our feelings

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
does not feel an exception

Falling from my face
I tried to feel the key values extending 

out in the snow falling face value
I tried to feel the extension of key values

white spots on a black surface
What would I feel without that goal

black spots on a white surface
But my not feeling the memory aside

in the face that I had
But my not feeling the memory inside

in the face that it had
which is what feels most comfortable

stopped light with validated faces
which I feel formerly about for

my interfaced stand data
