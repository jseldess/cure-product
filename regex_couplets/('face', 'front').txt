('face', 'front')

Then I cannot see face value
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Falling from my face
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

Falling off the edge of the face
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

out in the snow falling face value
in front of the set afternoon

I am not allowed to see their face
in front of the set of regulations

white spots on a black surface
And need out in front purchase

black spots on a white surface
behind or out front or up above
