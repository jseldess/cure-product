('face', 'get')

Then I cannot see face value
I’ll get there eventually

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
and is relentlessly budgeted

Falling from my face
I’ll get there ruins

Falling off the edge of the face
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

out in the snow falling face value
I get through there

black spots on a white surface
forgetting decisions 

in the face that it had
forgettable
