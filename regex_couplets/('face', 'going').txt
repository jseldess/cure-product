('face', 'going')

Then I cannot see face value
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

white spots on a black surface
The way that she is going

in the face that it had
The way that I am going

stopped light with validated faces
