('face', 'hear')

Then I cannot see face value
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling from my face
and my heart rate

Falling off the edge of the face
I hear it between bills and stuff

white spots on a black surface
I can hear it between bills and stuff

black spots on a white surface
as far back as my history heard

not many face up
I can hear them between bills and stuff

in the face that I had
In my heart did I lose trust

stopped light with validated faces
