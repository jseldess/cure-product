('face', 'her')

Then I cannot see face value
I’ll pull myself another personality type

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Of course there is a direction

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
One day there is direction

Falling from my face
I’ll get there eventually

Face falling off the edge of the face
I’ll pull my data higher up

Falling off the edge of the face
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

The value falling off the edge of th face
there was no promotion

white spots on a black surface
but would I love her the same

black spots on a white surface
Where I take my liesure

not many face up
On the other hand

though not many face up
there was no television to hear

in the face that I had
Though we are waiting for her

in the face that it had
Where in me did I lose

stopped light with validated faces
By my memory elsewhere

my interfaced stand data
in memory elsewhere

I interfaced
but for memory elsewhere
