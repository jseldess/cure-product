('face', 'here')

Then I cannot see face value
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Of course there is a direction

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
One day there is direction

Falling from my face
where I sleep at times

Face falling off the edge of the face
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Falling off the edge of the face
there was no promotion

white spots on a black surface
Where I take my liesure

black spots on a white surface
there was no television to hear

in the face that I had
where I send and relive would be held

in the face that it had
Where in me did I lose

stopped light with validated faces
By my memory elsewhere

my interfaced stand data
in memory elsewhere

I interfaced
but for memory elsewhere
