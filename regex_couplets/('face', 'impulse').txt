('face', 'impulse')

Then I cannot see face value
impulse control

Falling from my face
I send and retrieve the impulse

in the face that I had
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

in the face that it had
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

stopped light with validated faces
I stand and retrieve the impulse

my interfaced stand data
