('face', 'learning')

Then I cannot see face value
in light of learning what we see

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
I spend time online learning to code

Falling from my face
Then I am learning to code

out in the snow falling face value
phase decision for learning

stopped light with validated faces
for learning by the prospect
