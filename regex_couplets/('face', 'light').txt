('face', 'light')

Then I cannot see face value
variegated reflected light

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Then fall then summer from my face
In the retroactive light

Falling from my face
In the light of retroactive conversations

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
stopped light with validated fields

stopped light with validated faces
where lights blended themselves
