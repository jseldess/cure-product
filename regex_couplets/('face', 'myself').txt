('face', 'myself')

Then I cannot see face value
I’ll pull myself another personality type

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
But I can’t let myself treat 

Falling from my face
I was enjoined to act again myself

Face falling off the edge of the face
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

Falling off the edge of the face
And make myself a visible

The value falling off the edge of the face
I keep turning back again myself

The value falling off the edge of th face
off the end myself

white spots on a black surface
myself

in the face that it had
the least productive of myself

my interfaced stand data
So I find myself at home
