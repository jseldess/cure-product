('face', 'need')

Then I cannot see face value
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
and can’t presume to need

Falling from my face
drifting away needs

Face falling off the edge of the face
I need the work

white spots on a black surface
I need an explicit statement

black spots on a white surface
which I needed for an explicit state

in the face that I had
not needing to wait

in the face that it had
in need one in that best own

stopped light with validated faces
need one in best own
