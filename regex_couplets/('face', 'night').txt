('face', 'night')

Then I cannot see face value
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Then fall then summer from my face
blue and sun again a second, then night

out in the snow falling face value
I had nightmares though

white spots on a black surface
dawn already formerly nights 

in the face that I had
last night

in the face that it had
battery dawn nights 

stopped light with validated faces
battery dawn nights ending themselves

I interfaced
dawn formerly nights lended themselves
