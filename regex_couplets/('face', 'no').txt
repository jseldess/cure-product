('face', 'no')

Then I cannot see face value
I’ll pull myself another personality type

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
on a snow day with my children

Then fall then summer from my face
not calling or echoing for once

Falling from my face
and not falling at all

Face falling off the edge of the face
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
if not directly on my skin

value falling off the edge of the face
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Falling off the edge of the face
Right now I’m the cart

The value falling off the edge of the face
by no ventillation my purpose

The value falling off the edge of th face
I am told by no ventillation

out in the snow falling face value
out in the snow fall

I am not allowed to see their face
of the economic value

white spots on a black surface
I take it out in the snow fall

black spots on a white surface
may not be engrained

not many face up
though not many freeze up

though not many face up
though not many facts up in the sky

in the face that I had
not speaking

in the face that it had
who knows the way

stopped light with validated faces
not literally moved about

my interfaced stand data
Aligned or not with my interests

I interfaced
between cereal and economic
