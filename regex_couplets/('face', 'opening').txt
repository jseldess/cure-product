('face', 'opening')

Then I cannot see face value
Before we walk across the wide opening

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Before anyone walks across the opening

Falling from my face
The simple act opening surmounted

black spots on a white surface
