('face', 'other')

Then I cannot see face value
I’ll pull myself another personality type

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
others desires

Falling from my face
Then I can’t presume to need others

Face falling off the edge of the face
On the other hand

white spots on a black surface
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

black spots on a white surface
and other types of tracking technology

in the face that I had
I presume to others

in the face that it had
to the other end

stopped light with validated faces
Cereal and others’ health
