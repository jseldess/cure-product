('face', 'our')

Then I cannot see face value
reasons resources

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
conversations with our purchase

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Of course there is a direction

Falling from my face
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling off the edge of the face
Two hours and

Face falling off the edge of the face
with four key value pairs

white spots on a black surface
or alter of course the time anyway

in the face that I had
Who throws contours away

stopped light with validated faces
phrase them of our possessions
