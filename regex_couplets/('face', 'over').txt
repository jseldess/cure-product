('face', 'over')

Then I cannot see face value
I step over the edge

Falling from my face
over the long time up in the sky

Face falling off the edge of the face
over the time line I was on

Falling off the edge of the face
over the long line up in the sky

out in the snow falling face value
oddly grown over with historic bark

white spots on a black surface
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

black spots on a white surface
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

in the face that I had
for not paying sound overwhelmed

in the face that it had
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
