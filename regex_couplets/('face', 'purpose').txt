('face', 'purpose')

Then I cannot see face value
by no ventillation my purpose

Falling from my face
until my purpose up in the sky

out in the snow falling face value
until I purpose the horizon

black spots on a white surface
My purpose up in the sky

white spots on a black surface
Where I host my purposes

in the face that I had
the impulse for my own purposes

in the face that it had
to the other end of my purpose

stopped light with validated faces
the impulse to my purpose

my interfaced stand data
for my own purposes
