('face', 'really')

Then I cannot see face value
because it was really dark

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
it was really sunny

Then fall then summer from my face
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
When they really take hold of my finger

Falling from my face
without really agreeing

in the face that I had
without really speaking

in the face that it had
also didn’t really move

my interfaced stand data
