('face', 'resume')

Then I cannot see face value
and can’t presume to need

Falling from my face
Then I can’t presume to need others

Face falling off the edge of the face
I resume unassimilable visions

white spots on a black surface
I resume indelible tracks

black spots on a white surface
I resume attributable visions

in the face that I had
I presume to others

in the face that it had
So I presume the offers already
