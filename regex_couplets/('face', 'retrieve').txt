('face', 'retrieve')

Then I cannot see face value
I send and retrieve the impulse

in the face that I had
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

in the face that it had
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

stopped light with validated faces
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

my interfaced stand data
