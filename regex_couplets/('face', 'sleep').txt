('face', 'sleep')

Then I cannot see face value
where I sleep at times

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
So I went back to sleep

Then fall then summer from my face
Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times

Falling from my face
Interrupted sleep or

Falling off the edge of the face
like flattening sleep 

black spots on a white surface
