('face', 'step')

Then I cannot see face value
I step off the edge

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
I step over the edge

Falling from my face
What the next step

out in the snow falling face value
Whatâ€™s the next step

I am not allowed to see their face
The next step 

white spots on a black surface
from which to step off

black spots on a white surface
step in by the prospect

stopped light with validated faces
phase decision step in
