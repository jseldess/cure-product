('face', 'through')

Then I cannot see face value
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling from my face
Back up through the results

Falling off the edge of the face
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

black spots on a white surface
I cannot clear it also through investiture

white spots on a black surface
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

in the face that I had
