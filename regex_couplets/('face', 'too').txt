('face', 'too')

Then I cannot see face value
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
too sunny to eat ice cream

Then fall then summer from my face
emerging this year from too much standing water

Falling from my face
learned without too much difficulty to code

out in the snow falling face value
Selma knows too 

stopped light with validated faces
