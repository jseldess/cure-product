('face', 'track')

Then I cannot see face value
I reuse indelible tracks 

white spots on a black surface
The first track

black spots on a white surface
I refuse indelible tracks

not many face up
I resume indelible tracks

in the face that I had
which as tracked befitted 

in the face that it had
which as tracked befitted phased

stopped light with validated faces
sizes track for asking sound
