('face', 'turn')

Then I cannot see face value
in a sharp downward turn 

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
In a sharp downard turn

Then fall then summer from my face
sudden downward turn

Falling from my face
I keep turning back again myself

Falling off the edge of the face
who knows how to turn it off

stopped light with validated faces
I turn not sad exactly

I interfaced
I return not sad exactly
