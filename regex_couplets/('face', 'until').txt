('face', 'until')

Then I cannot see face value
until my purpose up in the sky

Falling from my face
until I could not tire 

black spots on a white surface
until I could not be tired

white spots on a black surface
until I purpose up in the sky

in the face that I had
until a happier time found

in the face that it had
