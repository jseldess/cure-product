('face', 'us')

Then I cannot see face value
asynchronous 

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Because it was really dark

Then fall then summer from my face
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Falling from my face
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Face falling off the edge of the face
I want to cite a poem so usual

Falling off the edge of the face
The ventillation rushes on

out in the snow falling face value
So stay with us

white spots on a black surface
I reuse unassimilable visions

black spots on a white surface
I reuse indelible tracks

not many face up
it was not just a defeat

in the face that I had
in the form filled offered in trust

in the face that it had
about the sight hosting trusting

stopped light with validated faces
radiating from housing

I interfaced
I have them trust in me
