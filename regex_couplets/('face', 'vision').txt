('face', 'vision')

Then I cannot see face value
I had me a vision

Falling from my face
The planning process for visions

out in the snow falling face value
The planning process is for visionaries only

I am not allowed to see their face
aspirating visions

white spots on a black surface
I reuse unassimilable visions

black spots on a white surface
I resume unassimilable visions

not many face up
up in the television pleasure

in the face that I had
there wasnâ€™t any television 

in the face that it had
joined in my television

my interfaced stand data
visions that can be attainable
