('face', 'walk')

Then I cannot see face value
Before we walk across the wide field

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Before we walk across the wide opening

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Before anyone walks across the opening

Falling from my face
there was no walking along the pleasure

white spots on a black surface
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

black spots on a white surface
