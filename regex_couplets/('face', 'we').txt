('face', 'We')

Then I cannot see face value
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
We can wrestle them with their goals

Falling from my face
We had to say goodbye there

black spots on a white surface
We had inhabited actually

in the face that I had
We ask say in that case
