('face', 'When')

Then I cannot see face value
When I woke up in the morning

Then fall then summer from my face
When I want something

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
When we had jobs that were to earn

Falling from my face
When closed to my knowing

black spots on a white surface
When I'm watching my tv 

in the face that it had
