('face', 'world')

Then I cannot see face value
off the edge of the world

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Which can be pronounced to the world

Falling from my face
off the end of the world

white spots on a black surface
hauling off the end of the world

black spots on a white surface
falling off the end of the world

not many face up
the opinions in my world

in the face that it had
