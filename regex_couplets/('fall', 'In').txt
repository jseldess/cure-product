('fall', 'IN')

Then fall then summer from my face
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

Then fall then summer
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

I see only the back of falling values
ASPIRATING

I see the back of falling values
ASPIRATING VISIONS

falling off the encoded end
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS
