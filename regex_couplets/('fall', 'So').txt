('fall', 'so')

Then fall then summer from my face
When I want something

Then fall then summer
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

and not falling at all
reasons resources

Face falling off the edge of the face
You can hear it also through your leisure

The value falling off the edge of the face
I’ll pull myself another personality type

The value falling off the edge of th face
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

I see only the back of falling values
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

falling off the encoded end
If I take some different measure

I take it out in the snow fall
no solid ground to continue along

falling off the end
I cannot clear it also through divestiture
