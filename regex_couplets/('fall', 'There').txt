('fall', 'There')

Then fall then summer from my face
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Then fall then summer
There are quarterly goals

and not falling at all
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Face falling off the edge of the face
There was very little physical activity

falling off the encoded end
There are spots waiting
