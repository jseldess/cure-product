('fall', 'To')

Then fall then summer from my face
To my children Walt Whitman

Then fall then summer
To my chidren

and not falling at all
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

Face falling off the edge of the face
Tomorrow

I see only the back of falling values
Toward the start informally given my reasons
