('fall', 'what')

Then fall then summer from my face
in light of learning what we see

Then fall then summer
Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them

and not falling at all
I invited most of what came next

falling off the encoded end
I even know what I would find

falling off the end of the world
what literally moved
