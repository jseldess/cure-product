('fall', 'across')

Then fall then summer from my face
Before we walk across the wide opening

and not falling at all
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Then fall then summer
Before anyone walks across the opening

Face falling off the edge of the face
across the retinas

falling off the encoded end
over the roof of the buildings across the alley
