('fall', 'any')

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Then fall then summer
Before anyone buys up the opening

and not falling at all
at any time it can drift again

Face falling off the edge of the face
Or the company

The value falling off the edge of th face
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

falling off the encoded end
there wasnâ€™t any television 

I take it out in the snow fall
not many face up
