('fall', 'but')

Then fall then summer from my face
but not impart cynicism

Then fall then summer
I want but not to impart cynicism

and not falling at all
Attributable or

Face falling off the edge of the face
but the sun isnâ€™t up

I see only the back of falling values
but it continued

falling off the encoded end
but would I love her the same

I take it out in the snow fall
but they are black spots

falling off the end of the world
but I can hear them
