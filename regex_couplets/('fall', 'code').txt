('fall', 'code')

Then fall then summer from my face
as long as I have access to the code

Then fall then summer
May I have your zip code

and not falling at all
learned without too much difficulty to code

I see only the back of falling values
falling off the encoded end

I take it out in the snow fall
encoded off the end

The first falling syllable
I click my zipcode up where it should be down
