('fall', 'count')

Then fall then summer from my face
Then I constellate my time family country

and not falling at all
So I constellate the time family country

Face falling off the edge of the face
I brought my count down

Then fall then summer
without the long time I was accounting

I take it out in the snow fall
the simple act of honoring an accountant
