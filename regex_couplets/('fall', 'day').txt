('fall', 'day')

Then fall then summer from my face
on a snow day with my children

and not falling at all
One day there is direction

Then fall then summer
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

Face falling off the edge of the face
I argued the days felt longer

I see the back of falling values
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

falling off the encoded end
The day
