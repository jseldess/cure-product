('fall', 'do')

Then fall then summer from my face
In a sharp downard turn

and not falling at all
It keeps coming down thankfully

Then fall then summer
does not feel an exception

Face falling off the edge of the face
in a sharp downward turn 

value falling off the edge of the face
The dogs and lillies

The value falling off the edge of the face
I brought my head down

The value falling off the edge of th face
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

I see only the back of falling values
What I do in my liesure

I take it out in the snow fall
Undoubtedly 

falling off the end
I walk up and don’t work anymore
