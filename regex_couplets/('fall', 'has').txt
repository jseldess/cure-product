('fall', 'has')

Then fall then summer from my face
conversations with our purchase

Then fall then summer
Before anyone has walked across the opening

and not falling at all
It has been since

Face falling off the edge of the face
in traversing my purchase

I take it out in the snow fall
purchased out
