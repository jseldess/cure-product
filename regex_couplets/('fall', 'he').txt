('fall', 'he')

Then fall then summer from my face
Before we walk across the wide opening

and not falling at all
Face falling off the edge of the face

value falling off the edge of the face
Then I cannot see face value

Then fall then summer
The sun isn’t up 

The value falling off the edge of the face
over the long time up in the sky

The value falling off the edge of th face
over the time line I was on

I see only the back of falling values
blue and sun again a second, then night

I see the back of falling values
The planning process for visions

I can see only values falling back
out in the snow 

I can see only the back of falling values
What the next step

out in the snow fall
out in the snow falling face value

falling off the encoded end
but would I love her the same

I take it out in the snow fall
I can hear it between bills and stuff

falling off the end
The first falling syllable

falling off the end of the world
off the end of the world

falling off the end of the word
The first track

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
talking into pheasants bending themselves
