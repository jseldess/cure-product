('fall', 'here')

Then fall then summer from my face
Of course there is a direction

Then fall then summer
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

and not falling at all
I’ll get there eventually

Face falling off the edge of the face
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

The value falling off the edge of th face
there was no promotion

falling off the encoded end
Where I take my liesure

I take it out in the snow fall
there was no walking along the pleasure

falling off the end
there was no television to hear
