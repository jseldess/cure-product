('fall', 'if')

Then fall then summer from my face
if not directly on my skin

Then fall then summer
drifting does not feel an exception

and not falling at all
drifting away

Face falling off the edge of the face
if you have providence to excess

The value falling off the edge of th face
learned without too much difficulty to code

I see only the back of falling values
That company creates a life

falling off the encoded end
If I take a different measure

I take it out in the snow fall
If I take some different measure

falling off the end
if there is anything
