('fall', 'now')

Then fall then summer from my face
who knows the way

and not falling at all
on a snow day with my children

Face falling off the edge of the face
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

Then fall then summer
Right now I’m the cart

value falling off the edge of the face
out in the snow

The value falling off the edge of th face
out in the snow fall

out in the snow falling face value
I take it out in the snow fall

falling off the end
I even know what I would find

falling off the end of the world
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
