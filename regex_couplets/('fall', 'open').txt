('fall', 'open')

Then fall then summer from my face
Before we walk across the wide opening

and not falling at all
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Then fall then summer
Before anyone buys up the opening

Face falling off the edge of the face
my desires were open

The value falling off the edge of th face
The simple act opening surmounted
