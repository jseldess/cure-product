('fall', 'pull')

Then fall then summer from my face
I’ll pull myself another personality type

and not falling at all
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

Face falling off the edge of the face
I’ll pull my data higher up

The value falling off the edge of the face
fish pulled out of the lake

Then fall then summer
I’ll pull myself higher up

The value falling off the edge of th face
