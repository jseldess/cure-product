('fall', 'ring')

Then fall then summer from my face
interferring 

Then fall then summer
bring your child along

and not falling at all
ring

Face falling off the edge of the face
hovering above standing water

The value falling off the edge of th face
actually considering the end

falling off the encoded end
the simple act of honoring an accountant
