('fall', 'step')

Then fall then summer from my face
I step off the edge

Then fall then summer
What the next step

I see the back of falling values
Whatâ€™s the next step

I can see only the back of falling values
The next step 

falling off the encoded end
from which to step off

I take it out in the snow fall
step in by the prospect
