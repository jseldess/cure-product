('fall', 'time.')

Then fall then summer from my face
only fragments of time with my children

Then fall then summer
where I sleep at times

and not falling at all
over the long time up in the sky

Face falling off the edge of the face
So I constellate the time family country

The value falling off the edge of the face
on the time line I was on

The value falling off the edge of th face
over the time line I was on

I see only the back of falling values
The long time I had a vision

I take it out in the snow fall
without the long time I was accounting

falling off the end
The long time I was a vision
