('fall', 'turn')

Then fall then summer from my face
In a sharp downard turn

and not falling at all
in a sharp downward turn 

Face falling off the edge of the face
sudden downward turn

value falling off the edge of the face
I keep turning back again myself

Then fall then summer
I keep turning back

The value falling off the edge of th face
who knows how to turn it off
