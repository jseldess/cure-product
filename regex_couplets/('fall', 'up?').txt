('fall', 'up?')

Then fall then summer from my face
my children’s consumption

and not falling at all
value falling off the edge of the face

Then fall then summer
The sun isn’t up 

Face falling off the edge of the face
such as I see

The value falling off the edge of the face
over the long time up in the sky

The value falling off the edge of th face
by no ventillation my purpose

I see only the back of falling values
blue and sun again a second, then night

I see the back of falling values
I can see only values falling back

I can see only the back of falling values
an upsent afternoon

out in the snow fall
out in the snow falling face value

falling off the encoded end
white spots on a black surface

I take it out in the snow fall
I can hear it between bills and stuff

falling off the end
First language

The first falling syllable
hauling off the end of the world

falling off the end of the world
I reuse indelible tracks 

falling off the end of the word
actually considering the end

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I resume unassimilable visions
