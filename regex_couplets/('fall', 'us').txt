('fall', 'us')

Then fall then summer from my face
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Then fall then summer
Theyâ€™re just not mine

and not falling at all
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Face falling off the edge of the face
I want to cite a poem so usual

The value falling off the edge of th face
The ventillation rushes on

I see only the back of falling values
So stay with us

falling off the encoded end
I reuse unassimilable visions

I take it out in the snow fall
because there was no solid ground to continue along

falling off the end
I reuse indelible tracks

falling off the end of the world
I refuse indelible tracts
