('fall', 'use')

Then fall then summer from my face
You use the most essential parts

Then fall then summer
I reuse unassimilable visions

I take it out in the snow fall
because there was no solid ground to continue along

falling off the end
I reuse indelible tracks

falling off the end of the world
I refuse indelible tracts
