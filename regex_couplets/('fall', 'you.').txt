('fall', 'you.')

Then fall then summer from my face
Though how can you know without direction

Then fall then summer
You can hear it also through your leisure

and not falling at all
if you have providence to excess

Face falling off the edge of the face
That you can see only the back of

falling off the encoded end
where you can earn more 

I take it out in the snow fall
If you have confidence regardless all else
