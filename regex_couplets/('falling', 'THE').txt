('falling', 'THE')

and not falling at all
THE SNOW

Face falling off the edge of the face
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

The value falling off the edge of th face
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

I see only the back of falling values
THE OFFERS

falling off the end
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS
