('falling', 'front')

and not falling at all
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Face falling off the edge of the face
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

The value falling off the edge of th face
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

I see only the back of falling values
in front of the set afternoon

I see the back of falling values
in front of the set of regulations

falling off the encoded end
And need out in front purchase
