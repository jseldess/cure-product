('falling', 'no')

and not falling at all
Then I cannot see face value

Face falling off the edge of the face
on a snow day with my children

value falling off the edge of the face
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

The value falling off the edge of the face
I’ll pull myself another personality type

The value falling off the edge of th face
by no ventillation my purpose

I see only the back of falling values
upsent in the afternoon

I see the back of falling values
an upsent afternoon

I can see only values falling back
out in the snow 

I can see only the back of falling values
out in the snow fall

out in the snow falling face value
in front of the set afternoon

falling off the encoded end
I take it out in the snow fall

falling off the end
may not be ingrained

falling off the end of the world
may not be engrained

The first falling syllable
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
