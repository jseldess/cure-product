('falling', 'vision')

and not falling at all
I had me a vision

Face falling off the edge of the face
The planning process for visions

I see the back of falling values
The planning process is for visionaries only

I can see only the back of falling values
aspirating visions

falling off the encoded end
I reuse unassimilable visions

falling off the end
I resume unassimilable visions

falling off the end of the world
The long time I had a vision
