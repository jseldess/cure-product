('far', 'he')

as far as I can see
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

as far back as my history heard
What was the last time

for to tire as far back as my history
The long time I had a vision

for as far back as my history
The long time I was a vision

in welfare and hope
I stay the right of my elections
