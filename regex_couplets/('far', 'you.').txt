('far', 'you.')

as far as I can see
Though how can you know without direction

as far back as my history heard
You can hear it also through your leisure

for to tire as far back as my history
you need history

for as far back as my history
a futile joyous white sun

in welfare and hope
the young ripples inaudibly
