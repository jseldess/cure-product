('feel', 'A')

conversations with our feelings
All of the time

does not feel an exception
And as an extension of the values

I tried to feel the key values extending 
Aspirational strategy

I tried to feel the extension of key values
ASPIRATING VISIONS

when trying to feel the extension of key values
As an extension of the values

What would I feel without that goal
All that I can think I want

But my not feeling the memory aside
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

But my not feeling the memory inside
CONTRACT

which feels most comfortable
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

By my feeling the memory inside
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

which I feel formerly about for
Aligned or not with my interests
