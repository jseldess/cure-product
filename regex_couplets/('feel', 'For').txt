('feel', 'For')

conversations with our feelings
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I tried to feel the key values extending 
For an ungraspable time

But my not feeling the memory aside
For my own purchases

But my not feeling the memory inside
Formerly a way like this one

By my feeling the memory inside
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

which I feel formerly about for
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
