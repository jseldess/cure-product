('feel', 'My')

conversations with our feelings
My associations

What would I feel without that goal
My purpose up in the sky

But my not feeling the memory aside
My daughter with her way

But my not feeling the memory inside
My daughter helps too

By my feeling the memory inside
My say to the elections

which I feel formerly about for
My state kept loaned impression
