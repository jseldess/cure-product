('feel', 'That')

conversations with our feelings
That’s exaclty what I want for them

does not feel an exception
That’s where I sleep at times

I tried to feel the key values extending 
That you can see only the back of

I tried to feel the extension of key values
That company creates a life

What would I feel without that goal
That I captured an afterimage

But my not feeling the memory aside
That are my right to say

which I feel formerly about for
