('feel', 'There')

conversations with our feelings
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

does not feel an exception
There are quarterly goals

I tried to feel the key values extending 
There was very little physical activity

What would I feel without that goal
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

But my not feeling the memory aside
There are constant ways

But my not feeling the memory inside
There are no constant waves

By my feeling the memory inside
