('feel', 'Thou')

conversations with our feelings
Though there are quarters goals

does not feel an exception
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

But my not feeling the memory aside
Though we are waiting for her

But my not feeling the memory inside
Though we are waiting 

which feels most comfortable
Though we can’t help waiting

By my feeling the memory inside
