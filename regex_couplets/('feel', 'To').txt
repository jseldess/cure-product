('feel', 'To')

conversations with our feelings
To my children Walt Whitman

does not feel an exception
To my chidren

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
To my children

I tried to feel the key values extending 
Tomorrow

But my not feeling the memory aside
To the ends of transactions

But my not feeling the memory inside
To the ends of my transactions

By my feeling the memory inside
To the other end of transactions like this

which I feel formerly about for
To the right of determined elections
