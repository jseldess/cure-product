('feel', 'Which')

conversations with our feelings
Which is a measure to never live out

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Which can be pronounced to the world

I tried to feel the key values extending 
Which is a pleasure to never live out

But my not feeling the memory aside
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

which feels more comfortable
