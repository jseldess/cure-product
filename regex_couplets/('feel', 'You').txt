('feel', 'You')

conversations with our feelings
You can hear it also through your leisure

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
You use the most essential parts

I tried to feel the key values extending 
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

But my not feeling the memory aside
You can have seen offering
