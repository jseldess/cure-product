('feel', 'across')

conversations with our feelings
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

conversation with our feelings
Before anyone walks across the opening

does not feel an exception
across the retinas

What would I feel without that goal
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

But my not feeling the memory aside
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
