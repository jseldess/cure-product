('feel', 'actions')

conversations with our feelings
to the ends of my transactions

But my not feeling the memory aside
The ends of my transactions

But my not feeling the memory inside
To the ends of transactions

By my feeling the memory inside
the other end of actions

which I feel formerly about for
