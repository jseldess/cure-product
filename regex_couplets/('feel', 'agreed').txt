('feel', 'agreed')

conversations with our feelings
and to which I’ve agreed

But my not feeling the memory aside
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

But my not feeling the memory inside
and for which the plan agreed

which feels most comfortable
that agreed one of rest

which feels more comfortable
that agreed home
