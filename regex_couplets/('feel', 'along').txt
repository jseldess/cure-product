('feel', 'along')

conversations with our feelings
bring your child along

I tried to feel the key values extending 
The days lined along company

What would I feel without that goal
there was no walking along the pleasure

But my not feeling the memory aside
formerly along time they were on

But my not feeling the memory inside
formerly along my say to the elections

which I feel formerly about for
along cables
