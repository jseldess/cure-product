('feel', 'answer')

conversations with our feelings
for the duration of the answer

But my not feeling the memory aside
answered about 

which feels most comfortable
by the sight of the hosting answered about

which I feel formerly about for
washed I answered about

But my not feeling the memory inside
I answered what I thought

But my feeling the memory aside
at least for the duration of the answer
