('feel', 'answered')

conversations with our feelings
answered about 

But my not feeling the memory aside
by the sight of the hosting answered about

which I feel formerly about for
washed I answered about

But my not feeling the memory inside
I answered what I thought

But my feeling the memory aside
I answered about
