('feel', 'away')

conversations with our feelings
drifting away needs others presume desires

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
drifting away

I tried to feel the key values extending 
Who throws contours away

But my not feeling the memory inside
Formerly away there are constant ways

which I feel formerly about for
