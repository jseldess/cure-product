('feel', 'battery')

conversations with our feelings
battery dawn nights blending themselves

But my not feeling the memory aside
battery dawn nights 

But my not feeling the memory inside
to the other end battery dawn 

By my feeling the memory inside
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

which I feel formerly about for
battery dawn nights ending themselves
