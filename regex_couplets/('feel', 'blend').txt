('feel', 'blend')

conversations with our feelings
walking into percents blending themselves

But my not feeling the memory aside
where I blend and relive

which feels most comfortable
battery dawn nights blending themselves

which I feel formerly about for
where lights blended themselves

But my not feeling the memory inside
dawn formerly rights blended themselves
