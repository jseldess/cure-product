('feel', 'but')

conversations with our feelings
but not impart cynicism

does not feel an exception
I want but not to impart cynicism

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Attributable or

I tried to feel the key values extending 
but it continued

What would I feel without that goal
but they are black spots

But my not feeling the memory aside
that decisions can be attributable

But my not feeling the memory inside
but for memory elsewhere

which I feel formerly about for
decisions that can be attributable
