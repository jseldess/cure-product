('feel', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

conversations with our feelings
I can’t fix them without direction

does not feel an exception
and can’t presume to need

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I can’t presume to need others

I tried to feel the key values extending 
That can’t be glimpsed

I tried to feel the extension of key values
Though we can’t help waiting

But my not feeling the memory inside
I can’t remember them
