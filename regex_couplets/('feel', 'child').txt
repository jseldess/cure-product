('feel', 'child')

conversations with our feelings
on a snow day with my children

conversation with our feelings
especially in a child

does not feel an exception
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

drifting does not feel an exception
To my children Walt Whitman

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
To my children

I tried to feel the key values extending 
even my child

But my not feeling the memory aside
my possession of my children

which feels most comfortable
speech my possession of my children

But my not feeling the memory inside
