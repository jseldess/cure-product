('feel', 'count')

conversations with our feelings
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
So I constellate the time family country

I tried to feel the key values extending 
without the long time I was accounting

What would I feel without that goal
the simple act of honoring an accountant

But my not feeling the memory aside
