('feel', 'daughter')

conversations with our feelings
I love my daughter still

What would I feel without that goal
with my daughter

But my not feeling the memory inside
My daughter with her way

By my feeling the memory inside
my daughter will learn 

which I feel formerly about for
my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me
