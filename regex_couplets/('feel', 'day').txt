('feel', 'day')

conversations with our feelings
on a snow day with my children

conversation with our feelings
One day there is direction

does not feel an exception
I argued the days felt longer

I tried to feel the key values extending 
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I tried to feel the extension of key values
The days long aligned

What would I feel without that goal
The day

But my not feeling the memory aside
at least most days

which I feel formerly about for
