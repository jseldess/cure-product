('feel', 'decision')

conversations with our feelings
the planning process for decisions

I tried to feel the key values extending 
attributable decisions

But my not feeling the memory aside
forgetting decisions 

which feels most comfortable
decisioned to learn 

But my not feeling the memory inside
decisioned to learn back

which I feel formerly about for
decisions that can be attributable
