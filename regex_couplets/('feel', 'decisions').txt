('feel', 'decisions')

conversations with our feelings
the planning process for decisions

I tried to feel the key values extending 
attributable decisions

But my not feeling the memory aside
forgetting decisions 

which feels most comfortable
that decisions can be attributable

But my not feeling the memory inside
decisions that can be attributable
