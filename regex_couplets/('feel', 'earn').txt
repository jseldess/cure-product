('feel', 'earn')

conversations with our feelings
in light of learning what we see

conversation with our feelings
When we had jobs that were to earn

I tried to feel the key values extending 
where you can earn more 

But my not feeling the memory aside
decisioned to learn 

which feels most comfortable
decisioned to learn back

But my not feeling the memory inside
phase decision for learning

which I feel formerly about for
I learned my location
