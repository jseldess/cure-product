('feel', 'else')

conversations with our feelings
If you have confidence regardless all else

I tried to feel the key values extending 
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

But my not feeling the memory aside
and elsewhere my memory 

But my not feeling the memory inside
elsewhere by my memory

which I feel formerly about for
By my memory elsewhere

But my feeling the memory aside
in memory elsewhere
