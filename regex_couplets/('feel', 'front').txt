('feel', 'front')

conversations with our feelings
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

does not feel an exception
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

I tried to feel the key values extending 
in front of the set afternoon

I tried to feel the extension of key values
in front of the set of regulations

What would I feel without that goal
And need out in front purchase

But my not feeling the memory aside
behind or out front or up above
