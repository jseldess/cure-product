('feel', 'he')

conversations with our feelings
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

conversation with our feelings
Before anyone buys up the opening

does not feel an exception
The dogs and lillies

drifting does not feel an exception
The sun isnâ€™t up

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

I tried to feel the key values extending 
I argued the days felt longer

I tried to feel the extension of key values
when trying to feel the extension of key values

What would I feel without that goal
there was no promotion

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

But my not feeling the memory inside
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

which feels most comfortable
when it is not literal

which feels more comfortable
if there is anything 

which is what feels most comfortable
Where in me did I lose

which I feel formerly about for
washed I answered about

By my feeling the memory inside
There are constant ways

But my feeling the memory aside
firing and connecting somewhere
