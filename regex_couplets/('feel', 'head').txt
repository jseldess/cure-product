('feel', 'head')

conversations with our feelings
Without a head

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
I brought my head down

I tried to feel the key values extending 
into the next level head

I tried to feel the extension of key values
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

which feels more comfortable
