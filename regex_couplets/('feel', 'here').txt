('feel', 'here')

conversations with our feelings
Of course there is a direction

conversation with our feelings
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

does not feel an exception
I’ll get there eventually

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
where I sleep at times

I tried to feel the key values extending 
there was no promotion

I tried to feel the extension of key values
There was very little physical activity

What would I feel without that goal
there was no walking along the pleasure

But my not feeling the memory aside
where I send and relive aside

But my not feeling the memory inside
where I send and relive

which feels most comfortable
Where in me did I host

which feels more comfortable
if there is anything 

which is what feels most comfortable
Where in me did I lose

which I feel formerly about for
after though there’s no memory

By my feeling the memory inside
There are constant ways

But my feeling the memory aside
firing and connecting somewhere
