('feel', 'if')

conversations with our feelings
if not directly on my skin

does not feel an exception
drifting does not feel an exception

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
drifting away

I tried to feel the key values extending 
That company creates a life

What would I feel without that goal
If I take a different measure

But my not feeling the memory aside
if there is anything 

which feels more comfortable
if that has anything

which feels most comfortable
if only on the way to the trash
