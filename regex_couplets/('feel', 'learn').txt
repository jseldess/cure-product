('feel', 'learn')

conversations with our feelings
in light of learning what we see

conversation with our feelings
I spend time online learning to code

I tried to feel the key values extending 
decisioned to learn 

which feels most comfortable
decisioned to learn back

But my not feeling the memory inside
phase decision for learning

which I feel formerly about for
I learned my location
