('feel', 'learning')

conversations with our feelings
in light of learning what we see

conversation with our feelings
I spend time online learning to code

I tried to feel the key values extending 
phase decision for learning

But my not feeling the memory inside
for learning by the prospect

which I feel formerly about for
a precision for learning
