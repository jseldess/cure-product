('feel', 'light')

conversations with our feelings
in light of learning what we see

conversation with our feelings
stopped light with validated fields

which I feel formerly about for
where lights blended themselves

But my not feeling the memory inside
stopped light with validated faces

But my not feeling the memory aside
