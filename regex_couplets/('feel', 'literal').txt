('feel', 'literal')

conversations with our feelings
and literally moved

But my not feeling the memory aside
as it was designed literally

But my not feeling the memory inside
and literally unproved

which feels most comfortable
when it is not literal

which feels more comfortable
and literally moved about

which is what feels most comfortable
not literally moved about

By my feeling the memory inside
not literally moved

which I feel formerly about for
