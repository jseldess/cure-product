('feel', 'man')

conversations with our feelings
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

does not feel an exception
To my children Walt Whitman

drifting does not feel an exception
Walt Whitman

I tried to feel the key values extending 
not many face up

But my not feeling the memory aside
They have very many choices

But my not feeling the memory inside
and that man comes on to tell me 

which feels more comfortable
The many transparent pixel calls

By my feeling the memory inside
