('feel', 'mine')

conversations with our feelings
Theyâ€™re just not mine

does not feel an exception
The third letter from the end is mine

I tried to feel the key values extending 
The ads in mine

What would I feel without that goal
To the right of determined elections

which I feel formerly about for
