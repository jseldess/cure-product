('feel', 'move')

conversations with our feelings
since I can imagine movement

What would I feel without that goal
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

But my not feeling the memory aside
myself moved literally as it is

which feels most comfortable
I move

which feels more comfortable
and literally moved about

which is what feels most comfortable
not literally moved about

But my not feeling the memory inside
also didnâ€™t really move

which I feel formerly about for
not literally moved
