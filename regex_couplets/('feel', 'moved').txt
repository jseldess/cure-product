('feel', 'moved')

conversations with our feelings
and literally moved

But my not feeling the memory aside
myself moved literally as it is

which feels most comfortable
I literally moved

which feels more comfortable
and literally moved about

which is what feels most comfortable
not literally moved about

But my not feeling the memory inside
not literally moved

which I feel formerly about for
