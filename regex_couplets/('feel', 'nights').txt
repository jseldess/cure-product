('feel', 'nights')

conversations with our feelings
battery dawn nights blending themselves

But my not feeling the memory aside
with dawn already formerly nights 

which feels most comfortable
dawn already formerly nights 

But my not feeling the memory inside
battery dawn nights 

By my feeling the memory inside
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

which I feel formerly about for
battery dawn nights ending themselves
