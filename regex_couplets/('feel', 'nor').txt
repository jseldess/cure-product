('feel', 'nor')

conversations with our feelings
into the minority proportion of time

does not feel an exception
over the long line I would honor

I tried to feel the key values extending 
the simple act of honoring an accountant

But my not feeling the memory aside
which had on honor to be told

which feels most comfortable
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

But my not feeling the memory inside
