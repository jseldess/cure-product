('feel', 'now')

conversations with our feelings
on a snow day with my children

conversation with our feelings
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

does not feel an exception
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

I tried to feel the key values extending 
out in the snow fall

I tried to feel the extension of key values
I take it out in the snow fall

What would I feel without that goal
I even know what I would find

But my not feeling the memory aside
knowing the constituents

which feels most comfortable
who knows the way

which I feel formerly about for
who knows how to turn it off

But my not feeling the memory inside
who know the ways to their other end

By my feeling the memory inside
that their knowing
