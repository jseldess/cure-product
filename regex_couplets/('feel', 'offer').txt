('feel', 'offer')

conversations with our feelings
in the form filled offered in trust

But my not feeling the memory aside
in the form filled offered trust

which I feel formerly about for
in the form filled offered must

But my not feeling the memory inside
in track as offer asked 

But my feeling the memory aside
I assume the offers reliable
