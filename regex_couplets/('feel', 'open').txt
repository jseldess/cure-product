('feel', 'open')

conversations with our feelings
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

conversation with our feelings
Before anyone buys up the opening

does not feel an exception
my desires were open

I tried to feel the key values extending 
The simple act opening surmounted

But my not feeling the memory aside
