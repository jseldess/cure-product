('feel', 'our')

conversations with our feelings
Of course there is a direction

conversation with our feelings
You can hear it also through your leisure

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
reasons resources

I tried to feel the key values extending 
with four key value pairs

I tried to feel the extension of key values
your bid to the next highest ranked network

when trying to feel the extension of key values
or alter of course the time anyway

But my not feeling the memory aside
Who throws contours away

But my not feeling the memory inside
phrase them of our possessions
