('feel', 'possession')

conversations with our feelings
I speak to them my possessions

which feels more comfortable
my possessions

which feels most comfortable
my possession of my children

But my not feeling the memory inside
I speak them of my possessions

which I feel formerly about for
I stay the right of my possessions
