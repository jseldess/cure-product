('feel', 'really')

conversations with our feelings
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

does not feel an exception
When they really take hold of my finger

I tried to feel the key values extending 
without really agreeing

But my not feeling the memory aside
without really speaking

But my not feeling the memory inside
without really branding 

which feels most comfortable
without really binding

which feels more comfortable
without really needing

which is what feels most comfortable
also didn’t really move

which I feel formerly about for
