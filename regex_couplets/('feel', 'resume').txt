('feel', 'resume')

conversations with our feelings
and can’t presume to need

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I can’t presume to need others

I tried to feel the key values extending 
I resume unassimilable visions

But my not feeling the memory aside
I presume to others

which feels most comfortable
So I presume the offers already
