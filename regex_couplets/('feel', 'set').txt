('feel', 'set')

conversations with our feelings
upset by Gingrich

I tried to feel the key values extending 
in front of the set afternoon

I tried to feel the extension of key values
in front of the set of regulations

What would I feel without that goal
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

But my not feeling the memory aside
presets
