('feel', 'sight')

conversations with our feelings
In my sight 

What would I feel without that goal
in pursuit of the sight

But my not feeling the memory aside
converting sight

which feels most comfortable
my sight hosting

which is what feels most comfortable
about the sight hosting trusting

which I feel formerly about for
converting sight into a purchase

But my not feeling the memory inside
