('feel', 'sound')

conversations with our feelings
sound inundated for my own purchases

But my not feeling the memory aside
and sound redundant

But my not feeling the memory inside
for not paying sound overwhelmed

which feels most comfortable
by in the sound privacy

By my feeling the memory inside
by in the sounded privacy

which I feel formerly about for
buy in the sound privacy
