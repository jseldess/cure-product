('feel', 'speak')

conversations with our feelings
not speaking

But my not feeling the memory aside
without really speaking

But my not feeling the memory inside
would only speak willingly

which feels most comfortable
I speak to them my possessions

which feels more comfortable
I speak them of my possessions

which is what feels most comfortable
speak them of my possessions

By my feeling the memory inside
