('feel', 'stay')

conversations with our feelings
wrestling to stay still

does not feel an exception
So stay with us

What would I feel without that goal
own stays brought loyal

which feels most comfortable
own that stays brought loyal

But my not feeling the memory inside
that stays brought loyal

which I feel formerly about for
I stay the right of my elections
