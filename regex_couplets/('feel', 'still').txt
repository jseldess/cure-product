('feel', 'still')

conversations with our feelings
That is itself not still

does not feel an exception
I love my daughter still

What would I feel without that goal
though we are still breaking in

But my not feeling the memory aside
still wash conserving

which I feel formerly about for
so still them

But my not feeling the memory inside
