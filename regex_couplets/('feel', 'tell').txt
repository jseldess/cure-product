('feel', 'tell')

conversations with our feelings
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
So I constellate the time family country

I tried to feel the key values extending 
I had to tell them the news

What would I feel without that goal
I tell you my purposes

But my not feeling the memory aside
and that man comes on to tell me 

which feels more comfortable
