('feel', 'their')

conversations with our feelings
We can wrestle them with their goals

does not feel an exception
I am not allowed to see their face

I tried to feel the key values extending 
increasingly that their economic value

I tried to feel the extension of key values
that their economic value 

What would I feel without that goal
without their agreement

which feels more comfortable
to their other end

But my not feeling the memory inside
who know the ways to their other end

By my feeling the memory inside
that their knowing
