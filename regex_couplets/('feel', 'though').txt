('feel', 'though')

conversations with our feelings
As though stationary and a destination

does not feel an exception
though it was most emphatically that

I tried to feel the key values extending 
I had nightmares though

What would I feel without that goal
though not many freeze up

But my not feeling the memory aside
I thought

But my not feeling the memory inside
after though thereâ€™s no memory

By my feeling the memory inside
I answered what I thought

which I feel formerly about for
I answered what I thought about
