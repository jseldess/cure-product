('feel', 'time.')

conversations with our feelings
only fragments of time with my children

does not feel an exception
where I sleep at times

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

I tried to feel the key values extending 
The long time I had a vision

What would I feel without that goal
without the long time I was accounting

But my not feeling the memory aside
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

But my not feeling the memory inside
until a happier time found

which feels most comfortable
formerly a long time they were on

which feels more comfortable
formerly along time they were on

By my feeling the memory inside
time they were on

which I feel formerly about for
in the long time they were on
