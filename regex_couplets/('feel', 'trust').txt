('feel', 'trust')

conversations with our feelings
I have them trust in me

But my not feeling the memory aside
in the form filled offered in trust

But my not feeling the memory inside
about the sight hosting trusting

which I feel formerly about for
in the form filled offered trust 

By my feeling the memory inside
