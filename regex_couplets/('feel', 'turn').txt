('feel', 'turn')

conversations with our feelings
in a sharp downward turn 

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
sudden downward turn

I tried to feel the key values extending 
who knows how to turn it off

But my not feeling the memory inside
Bach helps turn it off

By my feeling the memory inside
I turn not sad exactly

which I feel formerly about for
I return not sad exactly
