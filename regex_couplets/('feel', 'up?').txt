('feel', 'up?')

conversations with our feelings
Of course there is a direction

conversation with our feelings
What is an impure product

does not feel an exception
but not impart cynicism

drifting does not feel an exception
The sun isnâ€™t up

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

I tried to feel the key values extending 
I argued the days felt longer

I tried to feel the extension of key values
when trying to feel the extension of key values

What would I feel without that goal
What would I feel without a goal

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

But my not feeling the memory inside
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

which feels most comfortable
in the form filled offered in trust

which feels more comfortable
without really needing

which is what feels most comfortable
redundant

which I feel formerly about for
not literally moved about

By my feeling the memory inside
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

But my feeling the memory aside
the least productive of myself
