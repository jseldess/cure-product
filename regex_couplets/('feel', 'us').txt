('feel', 'us')

conversations with our feelings
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

does not feel an exception
slow asynchronous

drifting does not feel an exception
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I tried to feel the key values extending 
So stay with us

What would I feel without that goal
because there was no solid ground to continue along

But my not feeling the memory aside
trackers collecting data on users

But my not feeling the memory inside
useless for not having paid

which feels most comfortable
in the form filled offered in trust

which feels more comfortable
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

which is what feels most comfortable
about the sight hosting trusting

which I feel formerly about for
in the form filled offered must

By my feeling the memory inside
radiating from housing
