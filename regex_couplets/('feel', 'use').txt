('feel', 'use')

conversations with our feelings
You use the most essential parts

I tried to feel the key values extending 
I reuse unassimilable visions

What would I feel without that goal
because there was no solid ground to continue along

But my not feeling the memory aside
trackers collecting data on users

But my not feeling the memory inside
useless for not having paid

which feels most comfortable
