('feel', 'wait')

conversations with our feelings
There are spots waiting

But my not feeling the memory aside
Though we are waiting for her

But my not feeling the memory inside
not needing to wait

which feels most comfortable
Though we are waiting 

which feels more comfortable
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

By my feeling the memory inside
waiting out front or up above
