('feel', 'want')

conversations with our feelings
When I want something

conversation with our feelings
I want to find a way to block it incoming

does not feel an exception
I want but not to impart cynicism

drifting does not feel an exception
I want to cite a poem so usual

I tried to feel the key values extending 
all that I can think I want

But my not feeling the memory aside
