('feel', 'watch')

conversations with our feelings
when watching tv

What would I feel without that goal
in the sense of watching

But my not feeling the memory aside
When I'm watching my tv 

which feels more comfortable
so still watch them

which I feel formerly about for
where Iâ€™m watching my tv

But my feeling the memory aside
