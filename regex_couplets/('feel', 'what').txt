('feel', 'what')

conversations with our feelings
in light of learning what we see

conversation with our feelings
Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them

does not feel an exception
I invited most of what came next

What would I feel without that goal
I even know what I would find

But my not feeling the memory aside
what literally moved

which is what feels most comfortable
In what part did I lose trust

But my not feeling the memory inside
I answered what I thought

which I feel formerly about for
I answered what I thought about
