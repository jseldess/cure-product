('feel', 'will')

conversations with our feelings
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

does not feel an exception
will not be the same

But my not feeling the memory aside
would only willingly break

which feels most comfortable
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

which feels more comfortable
my daughter will learn 

But my not feeling the memory inside
