('feel', 'your')

conversations with our feelings
You can hear it also through your leisure

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
bring your child along

I tried to feel the key values extending 
your bid to the next highest ranked network

I tried to feel the extension of key values
This is your voice 

But my not feeling the memory aside
