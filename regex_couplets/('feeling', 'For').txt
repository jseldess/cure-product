('feeling', 'For')

conversations with our feelings
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

But my not feeling the memory aside
For my own purchases

But my not feeling the memory inside
Formerly a way like this one

By my feeling the memory inside
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

But my feeling the memory aside
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
