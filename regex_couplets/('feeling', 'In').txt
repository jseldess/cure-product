('feeling', 'IN')

conversations with our feelings
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

But my not feeling the memory aside
By NATASHA SINGER

But my not feeling the memory inside
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

By my feeling the memory inside
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

But my feeling the memory aside
