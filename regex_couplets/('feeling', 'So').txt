('feeling', 'so')

conversations with our feelings
When I want something

conversation with our feelings
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

But my not feeling the memory aside
sound inundated for my own purchases

But my not feeling the memory inside
firing and connecting somewhere

By my feeling the memory inside
by in the sound privacy

But my feeling the memory aside
also didn’t really move
