('feeling', 'though')

conversations with our feelings
As though stationary and a destination

But my not feeling the memory aside
I thought

But my not feeling the memory inside
after though thereâ€™s no memory

By my feeling the memory inside
I answered what I thought

But my feeling the memory aside
I answered what I thought about
