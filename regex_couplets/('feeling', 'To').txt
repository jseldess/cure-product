('feeling', 'To')

conversations with our feelings
To my children Walt Whitman

But my not feeling the memory aside
To the ends of transactions

But my not feeling the memory inside
To the ends of my transactions

By my feeling the memory inside
To the other end of transactions like this

But my feeling the memory aside
To the right of determined elections
