('feeling', 'what')

conversations with our feelings
in light of learning what we see

conversation with our feelings
Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them

But my not feeling the memory aside
what literally moved

But my not feeling the memory inside
I answered what I thought

But my feeling the memory aside
I answered what I thought about
