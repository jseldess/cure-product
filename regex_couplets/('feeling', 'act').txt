('feeling', 'act')

conversations with our feelings
before we can have a retroactive

conversation with our feelings
One day was actually

But my not feeling the memory aside
The ends of my transactions

But my not feeling the memory inside
to the ends of my transactions

By my feeling the memory inside
the other end of actions

But my feeling the memory aside
I turn not sad exactly
