('feeling', 'agreed')

conversations with our feelings
and to which I’ve agreed

But my not feeling the memory aside
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

But my not feeling the memory inside
and for which the plan agreed

By my feeling the memory inside
that agreed one of rest

But my feeling the memory aside
that agreed home
