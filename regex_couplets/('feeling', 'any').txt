('feeling', 'any')

conversations with our feelings
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

conversation with our feelings
Before anyone buys up the opening

But my not feeling the memory aside
They have very many choices

But my not feeling the memory inside
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

By my feeling the memory inside
or imagined anyway
