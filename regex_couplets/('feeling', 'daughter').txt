('feeling', 'daughter')

conversations with our feelings
I love my daughter still

But my not feeling the memory aside
with my daughter

But my not feeling the memory inside
My daughter with her way

By my feeling the memory inside
my daughter will learn 

But my feeling the memory aside
my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me
