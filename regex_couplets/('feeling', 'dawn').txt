('feeling', 'dawn')

conversations with our feelings
Forecasting the story before dawn

But my not feeling the memory aside
dawn formerly

But my not feeling the memory inside
battery dawn nights 

By my feeling the memory inside
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

But my feeling the memory aside
battery dawn nights blending themselves
