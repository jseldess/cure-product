('feeling', 'eat')

conversations with our feelings
I reach repeated expressions first

conversation with our feelings
I propogated repeated expressions first

But my not feeling the memory aside
for the creation of the universe

But my not feeling the memory inside
burrowed about from repeated travels

But my feeling the memory aside
