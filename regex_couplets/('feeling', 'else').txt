('feeling', 'else')

conversations with our feelings
If you have confidence regardless all else

But my not feeling the memory aside
and elsewhere my memory 

But my not feeling the memory inside
elsewhere by my memory

By my feeling the memory inside
By my memory elsewhere

But my feeling the memory aside
in memory elsewhere
