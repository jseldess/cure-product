('feeling', 'going')

conversations with our feelings
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

But my not feeling the memory aside
The way that she is going

But my not feeling the memory inside
The way that I am going

By my feeling the memory inside
The way that I was going

But my feeling the memory aside
