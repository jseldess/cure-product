('feeling', 'has')

conversations with our feelings
Before anyone has walked across the opening

But my not feeling the memory aside
the impulse for my own purchases

But my not feeling the memory inside
for my own purchases

By my feeling the memory inside
phase decisioned by the prospect

But my feeling the memory aside
at the site of a purchase
