('feeling', 'he')

conversations with our feelings
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

conversation with our feelings
Before anyone buys up the opening

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

But my not feeling the memory inside
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

By my feeling the memory inside
There are constant ways

But my feeling the memory aside
firing and connecting somewhere
