('feeling', 'here')

conversations with our feelings
Of course there is a direction

conversation with our feelings
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

But my not feeling the memory aside
where I send and relive aside

But my not feeling the memory inside
where I send and relive

By my feeling the memory inside
There are constant ways

But my feeling the memory aside
firing and connecting somewhere
