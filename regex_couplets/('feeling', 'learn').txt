('feeling', 'learn')

conversations with our feelings
in light of learning what we see

conversation with our feelings
I spend time online learning to code

But my not feeling the memory aside
decisioned to learn 

But my not feeling the memory inside
decisioned to learn back

But my feeling the memory aside
I learned my location
