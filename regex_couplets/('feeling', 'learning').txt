('feeling', 'learning')

conversations with our feelings
in light of learning what we see

conversation with our feelings
I spend time online learning to code

But my not feeling the memory aside
phase decision for learning

But my not feeling the memory inside
for learning by the prospect

But my feeling the memory aside
a precision for learning
