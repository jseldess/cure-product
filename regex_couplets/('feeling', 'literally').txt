('feeling', 'literally')

conversations with our feelings
and literally moved

But my not feeling the memory aside
as it was designed literally

But my not feeling the memory inside
and literally unproved

By my feeling the memory inside
not literally moved about

But my feeling the memory aside
not literally moved
