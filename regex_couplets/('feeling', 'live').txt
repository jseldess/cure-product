('feeling', 'live')

conversations with our feelings
Which is a measure to never live out

But my not feeling the memory aside
where I send and relive aside

But my not feeling the memory inside
where I send and relive

By my feeling the memory inside
where I stand and relive

But my feeling the memory aside
