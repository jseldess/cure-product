('feeling', 'mean')

conversations with our feelings
What does it mean to drift

But my not feeling the memory aside
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

But my not feeling the memory inside
The other end of means

By my feeling the memory inside
To the other end of means like this one

But my feeling the memory aside
