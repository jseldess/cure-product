('feeling', 'over')

conversations with our feelings
I step over the edge

But my not feeling the memory aside
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

But my not feeling the memory inside
for not paying sound overwhelmed

By my feeling the memory inside
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
