('feeling', 'prospect')

conversations with our feelings
the impulse for my own prospects

But my not feeling the memory aside
the impulse my own prospects

But my not feeling the memory inside
stopping into the prospect

By my feeling the memory inside
speech that is of by prospects

But my feeling the memory aside
The prospects there already
