('feeling', 'purchase')

conversations with our feelings
in traversing my purchase

But my not feeling the memory aside
the impulse for my own purchases

But my not feeling the memory inside
for my own purchases

By my feeling the memory inside
converting sight into a purchase

But my feeling the memory aside
at the site of a purchase
