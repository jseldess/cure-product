('feeling', 'purchases')

conversations with our feelings
I tell you the weight of my purchases

But my not feeling the memory aside
the impulse for my own purchases

But my not feeling the memory inside
for my own purchases

By my feeling the memory inside
impulse for my own purchases

But my feeling the memory aside
