('feeling', 'sound')

conversations with our feelings
sound inundated for my own purchases

But my not feeling the memory aside
and sound redundant

But my not feeling the memory inside
for not paying sound overwhelmed

By my feeling the memory inside
by in the sound privacy

But my feeling the memory aside
buy in the sound privacy
