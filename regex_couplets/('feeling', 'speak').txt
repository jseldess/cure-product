('feeling', 'speak')

conversations with our feelings
not speaking

But my not feeling the memory aside
without really speaking

But my not feeling the memory inside
would only speak willingly

By my feeling the memory inside
I speak them of my possessions

But my feeling the memory aside
speak them of my possessions
