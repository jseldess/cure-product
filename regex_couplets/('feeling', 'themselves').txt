('feeling', 'themselves')

conversations with our feelings
talking into pheasants bending themselves

But my not feeling the memory aside
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

But my not feeling the memory inside
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

But my feeling the memory aside
battery dawn nights blending themselves
