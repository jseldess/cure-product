('feeling', 'time.')

conversations with our feelings
only fragments of time with my children

But my not feeling the memory aside
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

But my not feeling the memory inside
until a happier time found

By my feeling the memory inside
formerly along time they were on

But my feeling the memory aside
in the long time they were on
