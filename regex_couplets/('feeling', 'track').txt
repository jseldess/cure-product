('feeling', 'track')

conversations with our feelings
I reuse indelible tracks 

But my not feeling the memory aside
and other types of tracking technology

But my not feeling the memory inside
which as tracked befitted 

By my feeling the memory inside
which as tracked befitted phased

But my feeling the memory aside
sizes track for asking sound
