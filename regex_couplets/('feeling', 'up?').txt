('feeling', 'up?')

conversations with our feelings
Of course there is a direction

conversation with our feelings
What is an impure product

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

But my not feeling the memory inside
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

By my feeling the memory inside
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

But my feeling the memory aside
the least productive of myself
