('feeling', 'us')

conversations with our feelings
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

But my not feeling the memory aside
trackers collecting data on users

But my not feeling the memory inside
useless for not having paid

By my feeling the memory inside
radiating from housing
