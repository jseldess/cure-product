('fill', 'up?')

in the form filled offered in trust
all parties would be held

in the form filled offered trust
answered about 

in the form filled offered must
 still carefully

in the form filled offered
In my heart did I lose trust

in the fill space 
behind or out front or up above

in the fill space out front
waiting out front or up above
