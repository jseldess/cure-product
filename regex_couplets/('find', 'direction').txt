('find', 'direction')

So I find myself at home
into rotating directionless 

I want to find a way to block it incoming
Of course there is a direction

I can find a way to block it incoming
One day there is direction

with goals I find there
and then into rotating and directional space

what I find there
stopping off in all directions
