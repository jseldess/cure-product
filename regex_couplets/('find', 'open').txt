('find', 'open')

So I find myself at home
Before we walk across the wide opening

I want to find a way to block it incoming
Before anyone buys up the opening

I want to find a way to block it
Before anyone walks across the opening

I can find a way to block it incoming
Before anyone has walked across the opening

I can find a way to block incoming 
my desires were open

Companies increasingly find 
The simple act opening surmounted
