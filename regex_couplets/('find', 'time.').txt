('find', 'time.')

So I find myself at home
Then I constellate my time family country

I want to find a way to block it incoming
only fragments of time with my children

with goals I find there
where I sleep at times

Companies increasingly find 
The long time I had a vision

I even know what I would find
without the long time I was accounting
