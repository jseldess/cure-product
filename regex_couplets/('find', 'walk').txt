('find', 'walk')

So I find myself at home
Before we walk across the wide field

I want to find a way to block it incoming
Before anyone walks across the opening

I can find a way to block it incoming
Before anyone has walked across the opening

I can find a way to block incoming 
Before anyone has walked across the field

I can find a way to block it
there was no walking along the pleasure

I even know what I would find
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
