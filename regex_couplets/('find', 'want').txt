('find', 'want')

So I find myself at home
When I want something

I want to find a way to block it incoming
I want to find a way to block it

I want to find a way to block incoming
Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them

I can find a way to block it
I want but not to impart cynicism

Companies increasingly find 
all that I can think I want

I even know what I would find
I want to cite a poem so usual
