('first', 'code')

I reach repeated expressions first
as long as I have access to the code

I am first in the office 
May I have your zip code

I am the first in the office
learned without too much difficulty to code

The first language
falling off the encoded end

The first track
encoded off the end

The first falling syllable
I click my zipcode up where it should be down
