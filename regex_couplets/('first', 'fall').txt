('first', 'fall')

I reach repeated expressions first
and not falling at all

I propogated repeated expressions first
Then fall then summer

I am first in the office 
Face falling off the edge of the face

I am the first in the office
The value falling off the edge of th face

The first language
falling off the end

The first falling syllable
falling off the encoded end

The first track
I take it out in the snow fall

The first syllable 
falling off the end of the world
