('first', 'he')

I reach repeated expressions first
The sun isn’t up 

I propogated repeated expressions first
Before anyone buys up the opening

I am first in the office 
I’ll pull myself another personality type

I am the first in the office
to be before the sun

The first language
falling off the end

The first falling syllable
that I can hear

The first track
encoded off the end

The first syllable 
falling off the end of the world
