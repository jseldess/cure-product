('first', 'hear')

I reach repeated expressions first
You can hear it also through your leisure

I am first in the office 
and my heart rate

I am the first in the office
I hear it between bills and stuff

The first language
that I can hear

The first track
I can hear it between bills and stuff

The first syllable 
that I hear without trying

The first falling syllable
as far back as my history heard
