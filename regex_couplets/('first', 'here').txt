('first', 'here')

I reach repeated expressions first
Of course there is a direction

I propogated repeated expressions first
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

I am first in the office 
I’ll get there eventually

I am the first in the office
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

The first language
Where I take my liesure

The first track
there was no television to hear
