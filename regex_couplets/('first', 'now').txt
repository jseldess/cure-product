('first', 'now')

I reach repeated expressions first
on a snow day with my children

I propogated repeated expressions first
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

I am first in the office 
Right now I’m the cart

I am the first in the office
out in the snow

The first language
I take it out in the snow fall

The first track
I even know what I would find

The first falling syllable
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
