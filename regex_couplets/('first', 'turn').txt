('first', 'turn')

I reach repeated expressions first
In a sharp downard turn

I propogated repeated expressions first
in a sharp downward turn 

I am first in the office 
sudden downward turn

I am the first in the office
I keep turning back again myself

The first language
who knows how to turn it off
