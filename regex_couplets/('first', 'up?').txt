('first', 'up?')

I reach repeated expressions first
The sun isn’t up 

I propogated repeated expressions first
such as I see

I am first in the office 
I’ll pull myself another personality type

I am the first in the office
to be before the sun

The first language
white spots on a black surface

The first track
First language

The first falling syllable
hauling off the end of the world

The first syllable 
I even know what I would find
