('first', 'us')

I reach repeated expressions first
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

I am first in the office 
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I am the first in the office
I want to cite a poem so usual

The first language
I reuse indelible tracks

The first track
I refuse indelible tracts
