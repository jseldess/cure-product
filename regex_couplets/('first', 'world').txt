('first', 'world')

I reach repeated expressions first
off the edge of the world

I am first in the office 
Which can be pronounced to the world

I am the first in the office
off the end of the world

The first language
hauling off the end of the world

The first track
falling off the end of the world

The first syllable 
the opinions in my world
