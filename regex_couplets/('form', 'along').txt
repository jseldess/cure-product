('form', 'along')

There are performance reviews
The days lined along company

Toward the start informally given my reasons
formerly along time they were on

A way formerly like this one
formerly along my say to the elections

formerly my way to the elections
drawn formerly along 

drawn formerly a long time
along cables

which I feel formerly about for
shone formerly along time

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
formerly along the time they were on

own best form
