('form', 'breaking')

There are performance reviews
though we are still breaking in

A way formerly like this one
though we are breaking in the space that it had

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
Though we are breaking 

already formely a long time
without really breaking

already formerly a long time
breaking from my constituents

dawn formerly
