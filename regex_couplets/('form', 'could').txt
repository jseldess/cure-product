('form', 'could')

There are performance reviews
and could be mapped and weighed

Toward the start informally given my reasons
until I could not be tired

already formerly a long time
And we could inhabit the room easy

in the form filled offered in trust
and could be inflected with reasons

own best form to ourselves
