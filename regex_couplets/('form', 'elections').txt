('form', 'elections')

There are performance reviews
on my way to elections

in the form filled offered in trust
formerly my way to the elections

shone formerly a long time
on a way to the elections

formally a way to the elections
formerly along my say to the elections

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
My say to the elections

which I feel formerly about for
I stay the right of my elections

own best form
