('form', 'live')

There are performance reviews
Which is a measure to never live out

Toward the start informally given my reasons
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

A way formerly like this one
where I send and relive would be held

already formely a long time
where I send and relive aside

in the form filled offered in trust
Where I stand and relive

already formerly a long time
where I send and relive

dawn formerly
where I send and retrieve relive

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
and relive from burrowed travels

with dawn already formerly nights 
where I stand and retrieve relive

which I feel formerly about for
