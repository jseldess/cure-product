('form', 'offer')

There are performance reviews
in the form filled offered in trust

already formerly a long time
in the form filled offered trust

which I feel formerly about for
in the form filled offered must

in the form filled offered
in the form help sale offered

in help in the form of a sale offered
in being offered help

dawn already formerly nights 
in track as offer asked 

A way formerly like this one
I assume the offers reliable

own best form to ourselves
I presume the offers
