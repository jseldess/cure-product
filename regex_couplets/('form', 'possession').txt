('form', 'possession')

There are performance reviews
I speak to them my possessions

with dawn already formerly nights 
my possession of my children

in the form filled offered in trust
I speak them of my possessions

A way formerly like this one
speech my possession of my children

which I feel formerly about for
I stay the right of my possessions 

own best form
possessions

own best form to ourselves
phrase them of our possessions
