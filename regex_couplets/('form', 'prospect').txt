There are performance reviews
the impulse for my own prospects

A way formerly like this one
the impulse my own prospects

already formely a long time
stopping into the prospect

in the form filled offered in trust
speech that is of by prospects

formerly a way
decisioned by the prospect

which I feel formerly about for
The prospects there already

own best form to ourselves
step in by the prospect
