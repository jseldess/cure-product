('form', 'really')

There are performance reviews
When they really take hold of my finger

Toward the start informally given my reasons
without really agreeing

A way formerly like this one
without really speaking

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
without really breaking

already formely a long time
without really branding 

in the form filled offered in trust
without really binding

already formerly a long time
without really needing

with dawn already formerly nights 
also didn’t really move

which I feel formerly about for
