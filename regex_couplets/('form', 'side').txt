('form', 'side')

There are performance reviews
aside from the retinas

Toward the start informally given my reasons
But my not feeling the memory aside

A way formerly like this one
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

already formely a long time
where I send and relive aside

in the form filled offered in trust
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

already formerly a long time
where I send and retrieve aside

dawn formerly
where I am aside at least

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I am aside

with dawn already formerly nights 
by the side of the hosting service

in the form filled offered trust
But my not feeling the memory inside

formerly a way
By my feeling the memory inside

formerly away
44 seconds inside

formerly my way 
where I stand aside

which I feel formerly about for
