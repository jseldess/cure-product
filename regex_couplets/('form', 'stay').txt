('form', 'stay')

There are performance reviews
So stay with us

Toward the start informally given my reasons
own stays brought loyal

in the form filled offered in trust
own that stays brought loyal

A way formerly like this one
that stays brought loyal

which I feel formerly about for
I stay the right of my elections

own best form
home stays brought loyal

the people in home form
own stays bought loyal

the people in own form
bought stays own loyal
