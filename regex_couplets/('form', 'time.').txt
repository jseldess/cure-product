('form', 'time.')

There are performance reviews
where I sleep at times

Toward the start informally given my reasons
The long time I had a vision

already formerly a long time
Or alter of course the time anyway

in the form filled offered in trust
formerly a long time they were on

A way formerly like this one
until a happier time found

with dawn already formerly nights 
formerly along time they were on

formerly a way
time they were on

drawn formerly a long time
in the long time they were on

addition were filters formerly
formerly along the time they were on

which I feel formerly about for
