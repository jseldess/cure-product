('form', 'us')

There are performance reviews
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Toward the start informally given my reasons
I have them trust in me

already formerly a long time
in the form filled offered in trust

dawn already formerly nights 
I want to cite a poem so usual

A way formerly like this one
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

already formely a long time
useless for not having paid

with dawn already formerly nights 
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

in the form filled offered trust
in the form filled offered must

in the form filled offered
In my heart did I lose trust

formerly along time they were on
radiating from housing

addition were filters formerly
