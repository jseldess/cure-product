('form', 'vision')

There are performance reviews
I had me a vision

Toward the start informally given my reasons
The long time I had a vision

already formerly a long time
there wasnâ€™t any television 

in the form filled offered in trust
joined in my television

which I feel formerly about for
visions that can be attainable
