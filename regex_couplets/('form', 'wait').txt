('form', 'wait')

There are performance reviews
There are spots waiting

already formerly a long time
Though we are waiting for her

dawn already formerly nights 
not needing to wait

in the form filled offered in trust
Though we are waiting 

with dawn already formerly nights 
Though we can’t help waiting

formerly a way
waiting out front or up above 

own best form
