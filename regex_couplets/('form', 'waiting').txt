('form', 'waiting')

There are performance reviews
There are spots waiting

already formerly a long time
Though we are waiting for her

dawn already formerly nights 
Though we are waiting 

in the form filled offered in trust
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

formerly a way
waiting out front or up above 

own best form
