('form', 'ways')

There are performance reviews
always watching

already formerly a long time
deep into pathways from repeated travels

in the form filled offered in trust
with constant ways 

formerly a way
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

formerly a way like this one
There are constant ways

formerly away
with constant ways to the other end

formerly my way
