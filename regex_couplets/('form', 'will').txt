('form', 'will')

There are performance reviews
will not be the same

Toward the start informally given my reasons
that will spur me on

already formerly a long time
would only willingly break

in the form filled offered in trust
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

in the form filled offered trust
my daughter will learn 

A way formerly like this one
