('formerly', 'For')

already formerly a long time
For Mitt Romney

A way formerly like this one
For my own purchases

dawn formerly
Formerly a way like this one

formerly a way
Formerly away there are constant ways

formerly away
Forty-one seconds in

formerly my way 
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
