('formerly', 'so')

already formerly a long time
I want to cite a poem so usual

A way formerly like this one
sound inundated for my own purchases

dawn formerly
firing and connecting somewhere

with dawn already formerly nights 
so still watch them

which I feel formerly about for
so still them

dawn already formerly nights 
by in the sound privacy

formerly a way
by in the sounded privacy

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
also didnâ€™t really move

addition were filters formerly
buy in the sound privacy
