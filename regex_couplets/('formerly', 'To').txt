('formerly', 'To')

already formerly a long time
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

A way formerly like this one
To the ends of transactions

dawn already formerly nights 
To the ends of my transactions

formerly a way like this one
To the other end of transactions

formerly a way
To the right of determined elections

which I feel formerly about for
