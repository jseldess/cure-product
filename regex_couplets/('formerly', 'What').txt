('formerly', 'what')

already formerly a long time
what literally moved

which I feel formerly about for
In what part did I lose trust

dawn already formerly nights 
I answered what I thought

shone formerly a long time
I assumed what I draw

formerly along time they were on
I answered what I thought about

shone formerly along time
to return what I bought
