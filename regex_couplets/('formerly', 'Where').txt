('formerly', 'Where')

already formerly a long time
Where in me did I host

dawn already formerly nights 
Where I host my purposes

A way formerly like this one
Where in me did I last

dawn formerly
Where in me did I lose

which I feel formerly about for
Where in me did I loose

formerly along time they were on
