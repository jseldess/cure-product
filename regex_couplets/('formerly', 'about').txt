('formerly', 'about')

already formerly a long time
burrowed about from repeated travels

with dawn already formerly nights 
and literally moved about

which I feel formerly about for
not literally moved about

dawn already formerly nights 
I answered about

dawn formerly
answered about 

addition were filters formerly
I answered what I thought about

shone formerly along time
about
