('formerly', 'act')

already formerly a long time
to the ends of my transactions

dawn already formerly nights 
We had inhabited actually

A way formerly like this one
The ends of my transactions

dawn formerly
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

which I feel formerly about for
To the ends of transactions

formerly along time they were on
to the ends of actions

formerly a way
to the other end of actions

formerly a way like this one
of my actions

formerly away
to the other end of transactions

formerly my way 
I turn not sad exactly

addition were filters formerly
I return not sad exactly
