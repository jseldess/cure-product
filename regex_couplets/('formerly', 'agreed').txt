('formerly', 'agreed')

already formerly a long time
and to which I’ve agreed

dawn already formerly nights 
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

dawn formerly
and for which the plan agreed

with dawn already formerly nights 
that agreed one of rest

formerly a long time they were on
and to which the plan agreed

which I feel formerly about for
that agreed home
