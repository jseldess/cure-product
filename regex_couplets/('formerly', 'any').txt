('formerly', 'any')

already formerly a long time
Or alter of course the time anyway

dawn already formerly nights 
if there is anything 

A way formerly like this one
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

with dawn already formerly nights 
if that has anything

which I feel formerly about for
The many transparent pixel calls

formerly a way
or imagined anyway
