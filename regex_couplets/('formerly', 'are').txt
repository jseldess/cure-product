('formerly', 'are')

already formerly a long time
Though we are waiting for her

dawn already formerly nights 
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

A way formerly like this one
though we are breaking in the space that it had

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
Though we are breaking 

dawn formerly
Though we are waiting 

with dawn already formerly nights 
still carefully

which I feel formerly about for
There are constant ways

formerly a way
That are my right to say
