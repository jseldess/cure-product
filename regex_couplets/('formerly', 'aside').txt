('formerly', 'aside')

already formerly a long time
But my not feeling the memory aside

A way formerly like this one
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

dawn formerly
where I am aside at least

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I am aside

with dawn already formerly nights 
where I send and relive aside

which I feel formerly about for
