('formerly', 'at')

already formerly a long time
I designated 

dawn already formerly nights 
if that has anything

A way formerly like this one
though we are breaking in the space that it had

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
found dated for my own purchases

dawn formerly
where I am aside at least

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
burrowed about from repeated travels

with dawn already formerly nights 
that is by possessed

formerly a long time they were on
in the space that it had

which I feel formerly about for
so still watch them

formerly along time they were on
that is of I am possessed

formerly a way
battery dawn nights 

formerly a way like this one
the way that I was going

formerly away
I answered what I thought

shone formerly a long time
I assumed what I draw

formerly along my say to the elections
that is by I am possessed

addition were filters formerly
I answered what I thought about

shone formerly along time
stopped light with validated fields

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
That are my right to say
