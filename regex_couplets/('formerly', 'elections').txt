('formerly', 'elections')

already formerly a long time
on my way to elections

dawn already formerly nights 
formerly my way to the elections

shone formerly a long time
on a way to the elections

formerly along time they were on
formerly along my say to the elections

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
formally a way to the elections

which I feel formerly about for
My say to the elections
