('formerly', 'feel')

already formerly a long time
But my not feeling the memory aside

A way formerly like this one
But my not feeling the memory inside

dawn formerly
which feels most comfortable

with dawn already formerly nights 
which feels more comfortable

which I feel formerly about for
By my feeling the memory inside

formerly a way
But my feeling the memory aside

addition were filters formerly
