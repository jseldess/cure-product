('formerly', 'from')

already formerly a long time
breaking from my constituents

dawn formerly
and relive from burrowed travels

with dawn already formerly nights 
from no one point

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
burrowed about from repeated travels

which I feel formerly about for
radiating from housing

addition were filters formerly
