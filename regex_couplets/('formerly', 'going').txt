('formerly', 'going')

already formerly a long time
The way that she is going

A way formerly like this one
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

which I feel formerly about for
The way that I am going

formerly a way
the way that I was going

formerly away
way I was going 

formerly my way
