('formerly', 'had')

already formerly a long time
We had inhabited actually

dawn already formerly nights 
in the face that I had

A way formerly like this one
though we are breaking in the space that it had

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
in the space that it had

dawn formerly
which had on honor to be told

with dawn already formerly nights 
I had me a vision

which I feel formerly about for
I had entered my phone

addition were filters formerly
