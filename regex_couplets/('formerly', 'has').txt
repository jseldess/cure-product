('formerly', 'has')

already formerly a long time
if that has anything

A way formerly like this one
for my own purchases

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
found dated for my own purchases

dawn formerly
phase decisioned by the prospect

formerly a way
phase decisioned

which I feel formerly about for
impulse for my own purchases

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
at the site of a purchase
