('formerly', 'have')

already formerly a long time
I have a memory between the day

dawn already formerly nights 
If you have confidence regardless all else

A way formerly like this one
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

which I feel formerly about for
I have turned it off

formerly a way
and have no way

formerly away
I have entered my phone

dawn formerly
I have them lost
