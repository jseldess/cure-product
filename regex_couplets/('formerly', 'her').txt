('formerly', 'her')

already formerly a long time
Where in me did I host

dawn already formerly nights 
if there is anything 

A way formerly like this one
where I send and relive would be held

dawn formerly
where I am aside at least

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I send and retrieve relive

with dawn already formerly nights 
Though we are waiting for her

formerly a long time they were on
I presume to others

which I feel formerly about for
after though there’s no memory

formerly along time they were on
with her waves

formerly a way
to the other end of actions

formerly a way like this one
to the other end

formerly away
with constant ways to the other end

formerly my way 
where rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
By my memory elsewhere

addition were filters formerly
where lights blended themselves

drawn formerly along 
Cereal and others’ health
