('formerly', 'here')

already formerly a long time
Where in me did I host

dawn already formerly nights 
if there is anything 

A way formerly like this one
where I send and relive would be held

dawn formerly
where I am aside at least

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I send and retrieve relive

with dawn already formerly nights 
Elsewhere by my memory

formerly a long time they were on
there wasn’t any television 

which I feel formerly about for
after though there’s no memory

formerly along time they were on
Is there a baby and a bear

formerly a way
There are constant ways

formerly away
where rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
By my memory elsewhere

addition were filters formerly
where lights blended themselves

drawn formerly along 
my ethereal economic relations
