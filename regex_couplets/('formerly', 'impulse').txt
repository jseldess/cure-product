('formerly', 'impulse')

already formerly a long time
I send and retrieve the impulse

A way formerly like this one
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

dawn formerly
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

formerly my way 
I stand and retrieve the impulse

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
