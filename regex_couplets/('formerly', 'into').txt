('formerly', 'into')

already formerly a long time
Then I saw into you

A way formerly like this one
deep into pathways from repeated travels

with dawn already formerly nights 
stopping into the prospect

dawn already formerly nights 
step by into the prospect

formerly a way
converting sight into a purchase

which I feel formerly about for
into liminal reflexing
