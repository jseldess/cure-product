('formerly', 'live')

already formerly a long time
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

A way formerly like this one
where I send and relive would be held

dawn formerly
where I send and retrieve relive

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
and relive from burrowed travels

with dawn already formerly nights 
where I send and relive

which I feel formerly about for
where I send and relive aside

addition were filters formerly
