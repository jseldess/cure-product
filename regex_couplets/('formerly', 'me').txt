('formerly', 'me')

already formerly a long time
I have a memory between the day

dawn already formerly nights 
formerly a long time they were on

A way formerly like this one
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

dawn formerly
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

with dawn already formerly nights 
by my memory

which I feel formerly about for
washed by my memory

formerly along time they were on
I presume to others

formerly a way
But my not feeling the memory inside

formerly a way like this one
The other end of means

formerly away
formerly my way 

shone formerly a long time
formerly my way to the elections

formerly along my say to the elections
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
drawn formerly along 

formerly a long time
I assumed what I draw

addition were filters formerly
in the long time they were on

shone formerly along time
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

drawn formerly rights blended themselves
dawn formerly nights ended themselves

drawn formerly rights
drawn formerly rights ended themselves

formerly along the time they were on
I have them trust in me
