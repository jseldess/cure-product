('formerly', 'move')

already formerly a long time
and literally moved

A way formerly like this one
myself moved literally as it is

with dawn already formerly nights 
and literally moved about

which I feel formerly about for
not literally moved about

dawn already formerly nights 
also didnâ€™t really move

addition were filters formerly
not literally moved
