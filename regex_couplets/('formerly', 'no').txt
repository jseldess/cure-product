('formerly', 'no')

already formerly a long time
The sun high enough to enter directly

A way formerly like this one
But my not feeling the memory aside

dawn formerly
not needing to wait

with dawn already formerly nights 
and it’s not literal

which I feel formerly about for
not literally moved about

dawn already formerly nights 
But my not feeling the memory inside

formerly a way
It’s not marshall exactly

formerly a way like this one
with no way

formerly away
I end up in Bach with no way 

formerly my way 
who knows the way

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
But my not 

addition were filters formerly
between cereal and economic
