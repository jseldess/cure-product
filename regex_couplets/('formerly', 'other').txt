('formerly', 'other')

already formerly a long time
and other types of tracking technology

A way formerly like this one
I presume to others

dawn already formerly nights 
to the other end

formerly a way
to the other end of actions

formerly a way like this one
The other end of means

formerly away
with constant ways to the other end

formerly my way 
Cereal and othersâ€™ health

which I feel formerly about for
I assume possession to others
