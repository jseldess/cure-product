('formerly', 'our')

already formerly a long time
Or alter of course the time anyway

dawn already formerly nights 
You can hear it also through your leisure

A way formerly like this one
Who throws contours away

formerly a way like this one
who throws contours a way

formerly a way
phrase them of our possessions
