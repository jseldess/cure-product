('formerly', 'own')

already formerly a long time
the impulse for my own prospects

A way formerly like this one
for my own purchases

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
found dated for my own purchases

dawn formerly
own stays brought loyal

dawn already formerly nights 
in need one in that best own

formerly a way
own that stays brought loyal

which I feel formerly about for
the impulse my own prospects

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
for my own purposes
