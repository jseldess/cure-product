('formerly', 'possession')

already formerly a long time
I speak to them my possessions

with dawn already formerly nights 
my possession of my children

dawn already formerly nights 
I speak them of my possessions

A way formerly like this one
speech my possession of my children

which I feel formerly about for
I stay the right of my possessions
