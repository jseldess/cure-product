('formerly', 'prospect')

already formerly a long time
the impulse for my own prospects

A way formerly like this one
the impulse my own prospects

dawn formerly
stopping into the prospect

dawn already formerly nights 
speech that is of by prospects

formerly a way
decisioned by the prospect

which I feel formerly about for
The prospects there already
