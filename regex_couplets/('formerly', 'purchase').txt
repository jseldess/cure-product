('formerly', 'purchase')

already formerly a long time
I have entered my purchases

A way formerly like this one
for my own purchases

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
found dated for my own purchases

dawn formerly
converting sight into a purchase

formerly a way
impulse for my own purchases

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
at the site of a purchase
