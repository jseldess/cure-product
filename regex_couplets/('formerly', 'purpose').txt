('formerly', 'purpose')

already formerly a long time
Where I host my purposes

A way formerly like this one
the impulse for my own purposes

dawn formerly
to the other end of my purpose

formerly my way 
the impulse to my purpose

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
for my own purposes

which I feel formerly about for
