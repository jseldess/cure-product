('formerly', 'really')

already formerly a long time
without really agreeing

A way formerly like this one
without really speaking

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
without really breaking

dawn formerly
without really branding 

with dawn already formerly nights 
without really needing

which I feel formerly about for
also didn’t really move

addition were filters formerly
