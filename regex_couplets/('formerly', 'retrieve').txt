('formerly', 'retrieve')

already formerly a long time
I send and retrieve the impulse

A way formerly like this one
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

dawn formerly
where I send and retrieve relive

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
retrieve 

with dawn already formerly nights 
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

formerly a way
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

formerly a way like this one
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

formerly away
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

formerly my way 
I stand and retrieve the impulse

which I feel formerly about for
