('formerly', 'say')

already formerly a long time
I ask say in that case

dawn already formerly nights 
we ask say in that case

A way formerly like this one
formerly along my say to the elections

formerly my way to the elections
I ask say in that phase decisioned

which I feel formerly about for
My say to the elections
