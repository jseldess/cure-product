('formerly', 'send')

already formerly a long time
I send and retrieve the impulse

A way formerly like this one
where I send and relive would be held

dawn formerly
where I send and retrieve relive

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I send and relive

with dawn already formerly nights 
where I send and relive aside

which I feel formerly about for
