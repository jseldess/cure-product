('formerly', 'sound')

already formerly a long time
sound inundated for my own purchases

dawn formerly
for not paying sound overwhelmed

with dawn already formerly nights 
by in the sound privacy

A way formerly like this one
by in the sounded privacy

which I feel formerly about for
buy in the sound privacy
