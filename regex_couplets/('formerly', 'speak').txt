('formerly', 'speak')

already formerly a long time
not speaking

A way formerly like this one
without really speaking

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
I speak to them

dawn formerly
would only speak willingly

with dawn already formerly nights 
I speak to them my possessions

dawn already formerly nights 
I speak them of my possessions

formerly a long time they were on
speak them of my possessions

formerly a way
