('formerly', 'stand')

already formerly a long time
I stand and retrieve the impulse

A way formerly like this one
where I stand and relive

dawn formerly
where I stand and retrieve and relive

with dawn already formerly nights 
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

formerly a way
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

formerly a way like this one
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

formerly away
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

formerly my way 
where I stand aside

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
my interfaced stand data

which I feel formerly about for
my standing in data

addition were filters formerly
but standing in memory

shone formerly along time
I learned the point of standing
