('formerly', 'them')

already formerly a long time
Then I saw them interview

A way formerly like this one
I speak to them

dawn formerly
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

with dawn already formerly nights 
I speak to them my possessions

dawn already formerly nights 
I speak them of my possessions

formerly a long time they were on
pre-worn and still wash them

which I feel formerly about for
so still them

formerly along time they were on
speak them of my possessions

formerly a way
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
phrase them of my possessions

addition were filters formerly
battery dawn nights ending themselves

shone formerly along time
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

drawn formerly rights blended themselves
dawn formerly nights ended themselves

drawn formerly rights
ended themselves

drawn formerly rights ended themselves
where rights ended themselves

drawn formerly along 
abjure them with determining
