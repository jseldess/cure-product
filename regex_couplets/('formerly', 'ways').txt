('formerly', 'ways')

already formerly a long time
deep into pathways from repeated travels

with dawn already formerly nights 
with constant ways 

formerly a way
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

formerly a way like this one
There are constant ways

formerly away
with constant ways to the other end

formerly my way
