('found', 'he')

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
washed my memory

found dated for my own purchases
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

and found inundated
all parties would be held

and found redundant
The ends of my transactions

and latency found
the opinions in my world

until a happier time found
the resemblance

So I found myself at home
the prospects there already
