('found', 'so')

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
sound inundated for my own purchases

and found inundated
and sound redundant

and found redundant
firing and connecting somewhere

and latency found
for not paying sound overwhelmed

until a happier time found
so still watch them

So I found myself at home
and could be inflected with reasons
