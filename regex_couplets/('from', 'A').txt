('from', 'A')

Then fall then summer from my face
All of the time

from the incoming stream
Actually one day there is direction

Falling from this distance
And as an extension of the values

drifting away from the task
And make myself a visible

Falling from my face
After having been contented

A person from a distance
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

Having transitioned from leisure to work
THE PLANNING PROCESS

Itâ€™s the third letter from the end
ASPIRATING

aside from the retinas
As an extension of the values

from which to step off
All that I can think I want

I get from here through there
COPY DREAM 

get from here through there
As a clone, illegally conceived

And from a weak distance
And for an ungraspable time

And from that great distance
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

And from a great distance
SOCIAL

breaking from my constituents
CONTRACT

from no one point
Aligned or not with my interests

radiating from housing
