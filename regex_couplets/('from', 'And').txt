('from', 'And')

Then fall then summer from my face
And put in place as though stationary

Falling from this distance
And as an extension of the values

drifting away from the task
And make myself a visible

Falling from my face
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

And from a weak distance
And for an ungraspable time

And from that great distance
And reached up the screen

And from a great distance
And we could inhabit the room easy

breaking from my constituents
