('from', 'As')

Then fall then summer from my face
As though stationary and a destination

Falling from this distance
Assimilable or

A person from a distance
Aspirational strategy

aside from the retinas
As an extension of the values

from which to step off
As a clone, illegally conceived

And from a weak distance
