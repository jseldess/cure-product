('from', 'but')

Then fall then summer from my face
but not impart cynicism

Falling from this distance
Attributable or

A person from a distance
but the sun isn’t up

It’s the third letter from the end
but it continued

aside from the retinas
but it continued rippling muscle

from which to step off
but would I love her the same

promoting from home to a new job
but they are black spots

I get from here through there
I resume attributable visions

get from here through there
attributable visions

And from a weak distance
that decisions can be attributable

from no one point
but for memory elsewhere
