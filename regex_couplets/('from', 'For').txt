('from', 'For')

Then fall then summer from my face
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Falling from this distance
Forecasting the story before dawn

The sun shielding from
For an ungraspable time

And from a weak distance
For Mitt Romney

breaking from my constituents
Formerly a way like this one

from no one point
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
