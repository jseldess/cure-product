Then fall then summer from my face
I’ll get there eventually

Falling from this distance
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Falling from my face
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

A person from a distance
I’ll get there ruins

out from below the fold
I’ll pull myself higher up

The sun shielding from
I’ll pull my data higher up

Having transitioned from leisure to work
