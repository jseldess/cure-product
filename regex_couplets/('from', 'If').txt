('from', 'if')

Then fall then summer from my face
if not directly on my skin

from the incoming stream
drifting does not feel an exception

Falling from this distance
drifting away

drifting away from the task
in a moment of drifting away from the task

Falling from my face
if you have providence to excess

A person from a distance
out of the fifth page ruins

emerging this year from standing water
learned without too much difficulty to code

Having transitioned from leisure to work
That company creates a life

aside from the retinas
Life is with people

from which to step off
If I take a different measure

promoting from home to a new job
If I take some different measure

I get from here through there
if there is anything 

breaking from my constituents
if that has anything

from no one point
if only on the way to the trash
