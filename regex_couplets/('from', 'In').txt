('from', 'IN')

Then fall then summer from my face
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

A person from a distance
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

Having transitioned from leisure to work
THE PLANNING PROCESS

It’s the third letter from the end
ASPIRATING

aside from the retinas
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

And from a weak distance
By NATASHA SINGER

breaking from my constituents
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

from no one point
