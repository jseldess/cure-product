('from', 'On')

Then fall then summer from my face
One day there is direction

from the incoming stream
On a day there will be direction

Falling from this distance
One year or

A person from a distance
On the bandwidth I was on

out from below the fold
On the timeline I was on

shielding from the bandwidth
On the other hand

I get from here through there
One was up where it should be down

breaking from my constituents
