('from', 'so')

Then fall then summer from my face
When I want something

from the incoming stream
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling from this distance
reasons resources

drifting away from the task
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Falling from my face
soft paper

A person from a distance
dislocated and a person from a distance

out from below the fold
or an available resource

The sun shielding from
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

It’s the third letter from the end
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aside from the retinas
my associations

from which to step off
with little reason to aspiration

promoting from home to a new job
no solid ground to continue along

promoting from home
than solid ground

from home
If I take some different measure

I get from here through there
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

And from a weak distance
so that nothing had gravity

breaking from my constituents
firing and connecting somewhere

from my constituents
for not paying sound overwhelmed

from no one point
also didn’t really move

radiating from housing
buy in the sound privacy
