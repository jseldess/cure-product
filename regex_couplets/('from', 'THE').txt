('from', 'THE')

Then fall then summer from my face
THE SNOW

Falling from this distance
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

A person from a distance
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

Having transitioned from leisure to work
THE PLANNING PROCESS

It’s the third letter from the end
THE OFFERS

I get from here through there
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

And from a weak distance
