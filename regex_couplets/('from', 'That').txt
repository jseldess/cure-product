('from', 'That')

Then fall then summer from my face
That’s exaclty what I want for them

from the incoming stream
That is itself not still

Falling from this distance
That’s where I sleep at times

drifting away from the task
That’s when they really take

out from below the fold
That you can see only the back of

aside from the retinas
That company creates a life

from which to step off
That I captured an afterimage

breaking from my constituents
That are my right to say
