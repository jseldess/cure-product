('from', 'There')

Then fall then summer from my face
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

from the incoming stream
There are quarterly goals

drifting away from the task
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

A person from a distance
There was very little physical activity

aside from the retinas
There are spots waiting

And from a great distance
There are constant ways

from no one point
