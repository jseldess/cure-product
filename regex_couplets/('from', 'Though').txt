('from', 'though')

Then fall then summer from my face
As though stationary and a destination

Falling from this distance
though it was most emphatically that

A person from a distance
I had nightmares though

aside from the retinas
though not many freeze up

I get from here through there
I thought

breaking from my constituents
after though thereâ€™s no memory

from no one point
I answered what I thought
