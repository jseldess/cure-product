('from', 'To')

Then fall then summer from my face
To my children Walt Whitman

Falling from this distance
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

A person from a distance
To that impossible place

out from below the fold
Tomorrow

Having transitioned from leisure to work
Toward the start informally given my reasons

I get from here through there
To neither study

breaking from my constituents
To the ends of transactions

from no one point
To the right of determined elections
