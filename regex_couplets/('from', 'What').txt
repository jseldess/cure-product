('from', 'what')

Then fall then summer from my face
in light of learning what we see

from the incoming stream
what I find there

Falling from this distance
I invited most of what came next

aside from the retinas
I even know what I would find

I get from here through there
what literally moved

from no one point
I answered what I thought
