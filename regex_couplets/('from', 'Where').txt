('from', 'Where')

Then fall then summer from my face
Where official policy is to catch and release

A person from a distance
Where I put it beating

out from below the fold
Where I take my liesure

from which to step off
Where I lead gravity

And from a weak distance
Where I need gravity

breaking from my constituents
Where in me did I host

from no one point
