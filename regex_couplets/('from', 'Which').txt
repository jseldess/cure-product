('from', 'Which')

Then fall then summer from my face
Which is a measure to never live out

Falling from this distance
Which can be pronounced to the world

A person from a distance
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I get from here through there
Which can be called confidence

breaking from my constituents
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

from no one point
