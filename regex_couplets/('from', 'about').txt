('from', 'about')

Then fall then summer from my face
about my childrenâ€™s consumption

Falling from this distance
burrowed about from repeated travels

from cables reheated travels
and literally moved about

from no one point
answered about 

deep into pathways from repeated travels
which I feel formerly about for

radiating from housing
I answered about
