('from', 'across')

Then fall then summer from my face
Before we walk across the wide opening

Falling from this distance
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

from the incoming stream
across the retinas

aside from the retinas
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

I get from here through there
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
