('from', 'act')

Then fall then summer from my face
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Falling from this distance
In the retroactive light

Falling from my face
of retroactive observations

from the incoming stream
One day was actually

drifting away from the task
I was enjoined to act again

out from below the fold
I was enjoined to act again myself

shielding from the bandwidth
and strategies not tactics

aside from the retinas
I am enjoined to act again

from which to step off
There was very little physical activity

promoting from home to a new job
actually considering the end

I get from here through there
we had inhabited actually

breaking from my constituents
The ends of my transactions

from my constituents
to the ends of my transactions

from no one point
I turn not sad exactly

radiating from housing
I return not sad exactly
