('from', 'along')

Then fall then summer from my face
bring your child along

Falling from this distance
The days lined along company

aside from the retinas
there was no walking along the pleasure

from which to step off
there was no walking along

promoting from home
no solid ground to continue along

from home
walking along the measure

walking from home along the measure
formerly along time they were on

from no one point
along cables

radiating from housing
shone formerly along time
