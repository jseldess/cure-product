('from', 'any')

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

from the incoming stream
at any time it can drift again

Falling from this distance
Or the company

dislocated and a person from a distance
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aside from the retinas
The days aligned for company

from which to step off
That company creates a life

promoting from home to a new job
there wasn’t any television 

I get from here through there
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

And from a weak distance
without any further damage

breaking from my constituents
latency which doesn’t mean anything

from no one point
or imagined anyway
