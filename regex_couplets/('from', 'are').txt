('from', 'are')

Then fall then summer from my face
Though there are quarters goals

Falling from this distance
There are quarterly goals

drifting away from the task
barely outlines

Having transitioned from leisure to work
They are called aspirational

aside from the retinas
I had nightmares though

from which to step off
The days are long

promoting from home to a new job
but they are black spots

I get from here through there
There are spots waiting

And from a great distance
Though we are waiting for her

breaking from my constituents
Though we are waiting 

from no one point
That are my right to say
