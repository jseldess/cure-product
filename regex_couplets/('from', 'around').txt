('from', 'around')

Then fall then summer from my face
Spinning around the heart

out from below the fold
around my country 

I get from here through there
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

And from a weak distance
around the dogs and lillies

And from that great distance
I spin around

And from a great distance
I spun around trying to touch the spots

breaking from my constituents
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

from no one point
and around redundant

and relive from burrowed travels
