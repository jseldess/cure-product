('from', 'aside')

Then fall then summer from my face
aside from the retinas

from which to step off
But my not feeling the memory aside

breaking from my constituents
where I send and relive aside

from no one point
where I am aside at least

and relive from burrowed travels
where I am aside

from my constituents
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

burrowed about from repeated travels
But my feeling the memory aside

radiating from housing
