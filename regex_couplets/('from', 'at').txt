('from', 'at')

Then fall then summer from my face
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Falling from this distance
and not falling at all

Falling from my face
of retroactive observations

from the incoming stream
and at my desk

drifting away from the task
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

A person from a distance
dislocated and a person from a distance

out from below the fold
hovering above standing water

emerging this year from standing water
emerging this year from too much standing water

to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water
to see the patterns on the birds

shielding from the bandwidth
I am told ventillation

Having transitioned from leisure to work
I am told by the ventillation

It’s the third letter from the end
What the next step

aside from the retinas
I argued that the days were longer

from which to step off
That company creates a life

promoting from home to a new job
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I get from here through there
I watch a movie

get from here through there
attributable visions

And from a weak distance
And from that great distance

And from a great distance
to catch the spots

breaking from my constituents
where I am aside at least

and relive from burrowed travels
burrowed about from repeated travels

from cables reheated travels
deep into pathways from repeated travels

from my constituents
and latently from constituents

latently from constituents 
with latency from constituents

from no one point
for the duration of the answer

radiating from housing
and persisting and replicating

shone from the housing
my standing in data
