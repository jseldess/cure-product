('from', 'blend')

Then fall then summer from my face
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Falling from this distance
walking into percents blending themselves

I get from here through there
where I blend and relive

from my constituents
where lights blended themselves

from no one point
dawn formerly rights blended themselves
