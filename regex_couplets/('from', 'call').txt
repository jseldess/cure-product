('from', 'call')

Then fall then summer from my face
not calling or echoing for once

Falling from this distance
though it was most emphatically that

A person from a distance
They are called aspirational

aside from the retinas
Which can be called confidence

I get from here through there
to take the call

from no one point
The many transparent pixel calls

and relive from burrowed travels
recalling aside

radiating from housing
