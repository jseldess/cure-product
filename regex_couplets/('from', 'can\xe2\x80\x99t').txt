Then fall then summer from my face
I can’t fix them without direction

Falling from this distance
Then I can’t presume to need others

drifting away from the task
But I can’t let myself treat 

Falling from my face
That can’t be glimpsed

aside from the retinas
Though we can’t help waiting

from no one point
I can’t remember them
