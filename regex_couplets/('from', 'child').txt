('from', 'child')

Then fall then summer from my face
my children’s consumption

Falling from this distance
about my children’s consumption

Falling from my face
on a snow day with my children

from the incoming stream
especially in a child

drifting away from the task
even my child

And from a weak distance
my possession of my children

from no one point
speech my possession of my children
