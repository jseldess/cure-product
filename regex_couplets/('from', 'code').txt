('from', 'code')

Then fall then summer from my face
as long as I have access to the code

Falling from this distance
May I have your zip code

A person from a distance
I spend time online learning to code

dislocated and a person from a distance
learned without too much difficulty to code

Having transitioned from leisure to work
Then I am learning to code

Itâ€™s the third letter from the end
falling off the encoded end

from which to step off
encoded off the end

I get from here through there
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

breaking from my constituents
zipcode

from no one point
