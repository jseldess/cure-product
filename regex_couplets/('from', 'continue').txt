('from', 'continue')

Then fall then summer from my face
but it continued

aside from the retinas
but it continued rippling muscle

from which to step off
no solid ground to continue along

promoting from home
and continue along having 

from home
I continue to presume

I get from here through there
I continue to consume

And from a weak distance
Then I continue to dream then

And from that great distance
I continued to dream then

breaking from my constituents
