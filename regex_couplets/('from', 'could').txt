('from', 'could')

Then fall then summer from my face
and could be mapped and weighed

out from below the fold
until I could not tire 

I get from here through there
I could consume the dream

And from a weak distance
I could in effect credit

And from that great distance
and we could inhabit the room easy

breaking from my constituents
and could be inflected with reasons
