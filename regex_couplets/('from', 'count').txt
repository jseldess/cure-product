('from', 'count')

Then fall then summer from my face
Then I constellate my time family country

Falling from this distance
So I constellate the time family country

Falling from my face
I brought my count down

out from below the fold
without the long time I was accounting

from which to step off
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I get from here through there
More reasons around my country 

breaking from my constituents
