('from', 'data')

Then fall then summer from my face
I’ll pull my data higher up

Falling from this distance
I’ll pull my data

Falling from my face
The days of private data

aside from the retinas
The days of public data

from which to step off
trackers collecting data on users

breaking from my constituents
my interfaced stand data

radiating from housing
my standing in data
