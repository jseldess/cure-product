('from', 'dawn')

Then fall then summer from my face
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Falling from this distance
Forecasting the story before dawn

The sun shielding from
dawn already formerly nights 

breaking from my constituents
dawn formerly

and relive from burrowed travels
with dawn already formerly nights 

from no one point
battery dawn nights ending themselves

radiating from housing
dawn formerly rights lended themselves
