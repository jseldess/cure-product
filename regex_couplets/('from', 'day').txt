('from', 'day')

Then fall then summer from my face
on a snow day with my children

Falling from this distance
One day there is direction

from the incoming stream
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

Falling from my face
I argued the days felt longer

aside from the retinas
I argued that the days were longer

from which to step off
The days were long aligned

promoting from home to a new job
The day

breaking from my constituents
at least most days

radiating from housing
