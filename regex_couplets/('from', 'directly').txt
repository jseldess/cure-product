('from', 'directly')

Then fall then summer from my face
if not directly on my skin

from the incoming stream
of not directly from my skin

Falling from this distance
But not to me directly

dislocated and a person from a distance
The sun high enough to enter directly 

I get from here through there
The sun high enough to strike directly
