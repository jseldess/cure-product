('from', 'do')

Then fall then summer from my face
In a sharp downard turn

Falling from this distance
It keeps coming down thankfully

from the incoming stream
does not feel an exception

Falling from my face
in a sharp downward turn 

drifting away from the task
sudden downward turn

A person from a distance
the dogs and lillies

out from below the fold
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

It’s the third letter from the end
What I do in my liesure

from which to step off
Undoubtedly 

promoting from home to a new job
I walk up and don’t work anymore

I get from here through there
here is the site of the battle of maldon

And from a weak distance
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

And from that great distance
around the dogs and lillies

And from a great distance
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

breaking from my constituents
and it doesn’t take long

and relive from burrowed travels
latency which doesn’t mean anything

from no one point
I only think I don’t listen
