('from', 'down')

Then fall then summer from my face
In a sharp downard turn

Falling from this distance
It keeps coming down thankfully

from the incoming stream
in a sharp downward turn 

Falling from my face
to the down arrow

drifting away from the task
sudden downward turn

A person from a distance
which I brought down with qualities

out from below the fold
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

breaking from my constituents
