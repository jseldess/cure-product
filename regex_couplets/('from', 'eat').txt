('from', 'eat')

Then fall then summer from my face
I reach repeated expressions first

Falling from this distance
I propogated repeated expressions first

from the incoming stream
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

Falling from my face
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

drifting away from the task
I let myself treat

A person from a distance
Where I put it beating

out from below the fold
executive breath

Having transitioned from leisure to work
of the habits I create

aside from the retinas
That company creates a life

from which to step off
it was not just a defeat

I get from here through there
And from that great distance

And from a weak distance
And from a great distance

breaking from my constituents
for the creation of the universe

and relive from burrowed travels
burrowed about from repeated travels

from cables reheated travels
deep into pathways from repeated travels

from my constituents
