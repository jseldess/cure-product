('from', 'edge')

Then fall then summer from my face
Face falling off the edge of the face

Falling from this distance
value falling off the edge of the face

from the incoming stream
The edge is put in place

Falling from my face
off the edge of the world

A person from a distance
Falling off the edge of the face

Having transitioned from leisure to work
and testing the edge and gravity

aside from the retinas
