('from', 'else')

Then fall then summer from my face
If you have confidence regardless all else

A person from a distance
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

And from a weak distance
and elsewhere my memory

breaking from my constituents
elsewhere by my memory

from no one point
By my memory elsewhere

radiating from housing
but for memory elsewhere
