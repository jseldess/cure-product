('from', 'ending')

Then fall then summer from my face
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Falling from this distance
I tried to feel the key values extending 

aside from the retinas
talking into pheasants bending themselves

from which to step off
talking into percents bending themselves

I get from here through there
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

and relive from burrowed travels
battery dawn nights ending themselves

radiating from housing
