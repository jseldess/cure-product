('from', 'fall')

Then fall then summer from my face
and not falling at all

Falling from this distance
Face falling off the edge of the face

Falling from my face
value falling off the edge of the face

from the incoming stream
Then fall then summer

drifting away from the task
The value falling off the edge of the face

A person from a distance
The value falling off the edge of th face

Having transitioned from leisure to work
I see only the back of falling values

aside from the retinas
falling off the encoded end

from which to step off
I take it out in the snow fall

I get from here through there
