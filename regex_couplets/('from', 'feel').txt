('from', 'feel')

Then fall then summer from my face
conversations with our feelings

from the incoming stream
does not feel an exception

Falling from this distance
I tried to feel the key values extending 

aside from the retinas
What would I feel without that goal

from which to step off
But my not feeling the memory aside

breaking from my constituents
But my not feeling the memory inside

from no one point
which feels most comfortable

and relive from burrowed travels
But my feeling the memory aside

radiating from housing
which I feel formerly about for
