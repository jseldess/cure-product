('from', 'feeling')

Then fall then summer from my face
conversations with our feelings

from the incoming stream
But my not feeling the memory aside

breaking from my constituents
But my not feeling the memory inside

from no one point
By my feeling the memory inside

and relive from burrowed travels
But my feeling the memory aside

radiating from housing
