('from', 'form')

Then fall then summer from my face
There are performance reviews

drifting away from the task
Toward the start informally given my reasons

I get from here through there
already formerly a long time

breaking from my constituents
dawn formerly

and relive from burrowed travels
in the form filled offered in trust

from no one point
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

burrowed about from repeated travels
which I feel formerly about for

radiating from housing
addition were filters formerly
