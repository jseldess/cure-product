('from', 'front')

Then fall then summer from my face
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

from the incoming stream
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

A person from a distance
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Itâ€™s the third letter from the end
in front of the set afternoon

aside from the retinas
And need out in front purchase

And from a weak distance
behind or out front or up above
