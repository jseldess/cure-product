('from', 'full')

Then fall then summer from my face
It keeps coming down thankfully

from the incoming stream
I am full of potential

aside from the retinas
with full potential to movement

from which to step off
full of aspirations

promoting from home to a new job
full of the missing words

breaking from my constituents
still carefully

from no one point
