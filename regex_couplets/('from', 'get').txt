('from', 'get')

Then fall then summer from my face
I’ll get there eventually

Falling from this distance
I’ll get there ruins

out from below the fold
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

It’s the third letter from the end
I get through there

I get from here through there
I get here through there

get from here through there
forgetting decisions 

from no one point
forgettable
