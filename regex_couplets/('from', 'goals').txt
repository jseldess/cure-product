('from', 'goals')

Then fall then summer from my face
Though there are quarters goals

Falling from this distance
There are quarterly goals

drifting away from the task
before morning goals

Having transitioned from leisure to work
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

Itâ€™s the third letter from the end
not goals

aside from the retinas
