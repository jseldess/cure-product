('from', 'had')

Then fall then summer from my face
If he had not carried one virtue

A person from a distance
I had me a vision

shielding from the bandwidth
Since I had to hold the entire company

aside from the retinas
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

from which to step off
I had to tell them the news

promoting from home to a new job
The long time I had a vision

I get from here through there
we had to say goodbye

And from a weak distance
that nothing had gravity

breaking from my constituents
which had on honor to be told

from no one point
I had entered my phone

radiating from housing
