('from', 'has')

Then fall then summer from my face
conversations with our purchase

from the incoming stream
It has been since

drifting away from the task
in traversing my purchase

from which to step off
purchased out

And from a weak distance
I tell you the weight of my purchases

And from that great distance
until I purchase up the sky

And from a great distance
until I purchase the sky

breaking from my constituents
for my own purchases

from no one point
if that has anything

and relive from burrowed travels
at the site of a purchase
