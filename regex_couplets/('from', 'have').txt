('from', 'have')

Then fall then summer from my face
I have entered my phone

Falling from this distance
before we can have a retroactive

from the incoming stream
as long as I have access to the code

Falling from my face
if you have providence to excess

A person from a distance
If you have confidence regardless all else

I get from here through there
I have supporters

And from a weak distance
I have a memory between the day

breaking from my constituents
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

from no one point
I have them lost
