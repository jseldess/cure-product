('from', 'he')

Then fall then summer from my face
Before we walk across the wide opening

Falling from this distance
Face falling off the edge of the face

Falling from my face
value falling off the edge of the face

from the incoming stream
as long as I have access to the code

drifting away from the task
in a moment of drifting away from the task

A person from a distance
The CEO tells me to embody values

dislocated and a person from a distance
Spinning around the heart

out from below the fold
out of the fifth page ruins

emerging this year from standing water
from where I can claim

from where I can claim to see the mosquitos
to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water

shielding from the bandwidth
Then fall then summer

The sun shielding from
The dogs and lillies

Having transitioned from leisure to work
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

It’s the third letter from the end
The third letter from the end is mine

aside from the retinas
I argued that the days were longer

from which to step off
And as an extension of the values

promoting from home to a new job
there was no walking along

promoting from home
where you can earn more 

from home
walking along the measure

walking from home along the measure
there wasn’t any television 

I get from here through there
I get here through there

get from here through there
I get through there

And from a weak distance
where I need gravity

And from that great distance
around the dogs and lillies

And from a great distance
While we’re up in the sky

breaking from my constituents
I speak to them

from no one point
where I am aside at least

and relive from burrowed travels
from cables reheated travels

deep into pathways from repeated travels
where I send and relive

from my constituents
only with the latency 

burrowed about from repeated travels
where I stand and retrieve and relive

radiating from housing
in the long time they were on

shone from the housing
battery dawn nights ending themselves
