('from', 'hear')

Then fall then summer from my face
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling from this distance
and my heart rate

A person from a distance
Spinning around the heart

out from below the fold
I hear it between bills and stuff

shielding from the bandwidth
I can hear it between bills and stuff

from which to step off
that I can hear

I get from here through there
In my heart did I lose trust

from no one point
