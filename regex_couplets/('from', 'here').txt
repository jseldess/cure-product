('from', 'here')

Then fall then summer from my face
Of course there is a direction

from the incoming stream
One day there is direction

Falling from this distance
I’ll get there eventually

drifting away from the task
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

A person from a distance
Where I put it beating

out from below the fold
where I can lay claim to ruins

emerging this year from standing water
from where I can claim

from where I can claim to see the mosquitos
there was no promotion

shielding from the bandwidth
There was very little physical activity

aside from the retinas
that potential is there for you

from which to step off
Where I take my liesure

promoting from home to a new job
there was no walking along

promoting from home
where you can earn more 

from home
there wasn’t any television 

I get from here through there
I get here through there

get from here through there
I get through there

And from a weak distance
where I need gravity

And from that great distance
Where I lead gravity

And from a great distance
There are spots waiting

breaking from my constituents
where I send and relive

from no one point
where I am aside at least

and relive from burrowed travels
where I stand and retrieve and relive

from my constituents
Where in me did I host

burrowed about from repeated travels
where I am aside

radiating from housing
but for memory elsewhere
