('from', 'high')

Then fall then summer from my face
way high up in the inter

Falling from this distance
way high up in the internet

A person from a distance
higher up in the results

out from below the fold
high up in the results

emerging this year from standing water
high up in the internet

shielding from the bandwidth
I’ll pull myself higher up

The sun shielding from
I’ll pull my data higher up

Falling from my face
your bid to the next highest ranked network

aside from the retinas
The sun high enough to enter directly 

I get from here through there
The sun high enough to strike directly
