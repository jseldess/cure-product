('from', 'hold')

Then fall then summer from my face
I take hold of my finger

A person from a distance
When they really take hold of my finger

out from below the fold
Since I had to hold the entire company

aside from the retinas
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

from which to step off
and hold and wish to hold

I get from here through there
designed to hold up my underwear

And from a weak distance
