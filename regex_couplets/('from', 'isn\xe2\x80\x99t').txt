('from', 'isn\xe2\x80\x99t')

Then fall then summer from my face
The sun isn’t up 

Falling from this distance
The edge isn’t even there

Falling from my face
Then the sun isn’t available

A person from a distance
Then the sun isn’t up

out from below the fold
but the sun isn’t up

It’s the third letter from the end
