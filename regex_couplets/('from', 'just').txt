('from', 'just')

Then fall then summer from my face
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

from the incoming stream
They’re just not mine

Falling from this distance
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

drifting away from the task
was not just a defeat

A person from a distance
I just got a letter

It’s the third letter from the end
it was not just a defeat

I get from here through there
