('from', 'know')

Then fall then summer from my face
who knows the way

Falling from this distance
how can I know without direction

Falling from my face
I even know what I would find

I get from here through there
even when close to my knowing

get from here through there
When closed to my knowing

And from a weak distance
knowing the constituents

from no one point
that their knowing
