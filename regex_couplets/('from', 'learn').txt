('from', 'learn')

Then fall then summer from my face
in light of learning what we see

from the incoming stream
I spend time online learning to code

dislocated and a person from a distance
learned without too much difficulty to code

Having transitioned from leisure to work
Then I am learning to code

Itâ€™s the third letter from the end
decisioned to learn 

from no one point
I learned my location
