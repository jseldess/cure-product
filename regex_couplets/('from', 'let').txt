('from', 'let')

Then fall then summer from my face
But I can’t let myself treat 

Falling from this distance
I let myself treat

drifting away from the task
But I can’t let myself disregard

Falling from my face
It’s the third letter from the end

The third letter from the end is mine
I just got a letter

aside from the retinas
I let it remind me again

And from a weak distance
