('from', 'light')

Then fall then summer from my face
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Falling from this distance
In the retroactive light

Falling from my face
In the light of retroactive conversations

from the incoming stream
stopped light with validated fields

from no one point
where lights blended themselves
