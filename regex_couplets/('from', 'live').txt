('from', 'live')

Then fall then summer from my face
Which is a measure to never live out

Falling from this distance
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

A person from a distance
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I get from here through there
where I send and relive aside

breaking from my constituents
where I send and relive

from no one point
where I send and retrieve relive

and relive from burrowed travels
where I stand and retrieve and relive

from my constituents
where I stand and relive

burrowed about from repeated travels
where I end and relive

radiating from housing
