('from', 'man')

Then fall then summer from my face
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Falling from this distance
There are performance reviews

drifting away from the task
not many face up

I get from here through there
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

breaking from my constituents
and that man comes on to tell me 

from no one point
