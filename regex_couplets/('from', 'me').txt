('from', 'me')

Then fall then summer from my face
Then fall then summer

Falling from this distance
When I want something

from the incoming stream
only fragments of time with my children

Falling from my face
over the long time up in the sky

drifting away from the task
in a moment of drifting away from the task

A person from a distance
The CEO tells me to embody values

dislocated and a person from a distance
In a continuous theme

out from below the fold
emerging this year from standing water

from where I can claim
emerging this year from too much standing water

to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water
I had me a vision

shielding from the bandwidth
summer

The sun shielding from
Booked with a meeting

Having transitioned from leisure to work
Strategy comes before morning

It’s the third letter from the end
since I can imagine movement

aside from the retinas
with full potential to movement

from which to step off
since you can imagine movement

promoting from home to a new job
promoting from home

from home
walking along the measure

walking from home along the measure
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I get from here through there
If I take some different measure

get from here through there
I continue to presume

And from a weak distance
And for an ungraspable time

And from that great distance
I came back to me

And from a great distance
or in some imaginary elsewhere

breaking from my constituents
But my not feeling the memory inside

from no one point
dawn formerly

and relive from burrowed travels
But my not feeling the memory aside

from my constituents
for not paying sound overwhelmed

burrowed about from repeated travels
firing and connecting somewhere

radiating from housing
in the long time they were on

shone from the housing
but for memory elsewhere
