('from', 'myself')

Then fall then summer from my face
But I can’t let myself treat 

Falling from this distance
I was enjoined to act again myself

drifting away from the task
I let myself treat

Falling from my face
I’ll pull myself another personality type

A person from a distance
I keep turning back again myself

out from below the fold
I’ll pull myself higher up

The sun shielding from
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

Having transitioned from leisure to work
off the end myself

aside from the retinas
I was bid to act again myself

from which to step off
myself

from no one point
the least productive of myself

radiating from housing
So I find myself at home
