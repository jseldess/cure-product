('from', 'night')

Then fall then summer from my face
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Falling from this distance
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

Falling from my face
blue and sun again a second, then night

aside from the retinas
I had nightmares though

from which to step off
dawn already formerly nights 

breaking from my constituents
last night

from no one point
battery dawn nights ending themselves

radiating from housing
dawn formerly nights lended themselves
