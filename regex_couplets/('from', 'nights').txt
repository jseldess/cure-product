('from', 'nights')

Then fall then summer from my face
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Falling from this distance
dawn already formerly nights 

breaking from my constituents
with dawn already formerly nights 

from no one point
battery dawn nights ending themselves

radiating from housing
dawn formerly nights lended themselves
