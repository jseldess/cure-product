('from', 'no')

Then fall then summer from my face
not calling or echoing for once

Falling from this distance
and not falling at all

Falling from my face
on a snow day with my children

from the incoming stream
if not directly on my skin

of not directly from my skin
into the minority proportion of time

drifting away from the task
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

A person from a distance
But not to me directly

dislocated and a person from a distance
Then I cannot see face value

out from below the fold
there was no promotion

shielding from the bandwidth
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Having transitioned from leisure to work
I am told by no ventillation

It’s the third letter from the end
upsent in the afternoon

aside from the retinas
I take it out in the snow fall

from which to step off
there was no walking along the pleasure

promoting from home to a new job
there was no walking along

promoting from home
no solid ground to continue along

from home
may not be ingrained

I get from here through there
even when close to my knowing

get from here through there
When closed to my knowing

And from a weak distance
I used my technology

And from that great distance
that nothing had gravity

breaking from my constituents
But my not feeling the memory inside

from no one point
But my not feeling the memory aside

and relive from burrowed travels
knowing the constituents

burrowed about from repeated travels
But my not 

radiating from housing
between cereal and economic
