('from', 'nor')

Then fall then summer from my face
into the minority proportion of time

Falling from this distance
over the long line I would honor

A person from a distance
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I get from here through there
nor work in this way daily

breaking from my constituents
which had on honor to be told

from no one point
