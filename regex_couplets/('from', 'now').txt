('from', 'now')

Then fall then summer from my face
who knows the way

Falling from this distance
on a snow day with my children

Falling from my face
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

drifting away from the task
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

A person from a distance
out in the snow

Having transitioned from leisure to work
out in the snow fall

aside from the retinas
I take it out in the snow fall

from which to step off
I even know what I would find

I get from here through there
even when close to my knowing

get from here through there
When closed to my knowing

And from a weak distance
knowing the constituents

from no one point
that their knowing
