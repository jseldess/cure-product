('from', 'only')

Then fall then summer from my face
only fragments of time with my children

Falling from this distance
only in the case

A person from a distance
So that I notice I am the only one

Itâ€™s the third letter from the end
I see only the back of falling values

aside from the retinas
would only willingly break

from my constituents
only from constituents

with latency from constituents
only with the latency 

from no one point
if only on the way to the trash
