('from', 'open')

Then fall then summer from my face
Before we walk across the wide opening

Falling from this distance
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

from the incoming stream
my desires were open

A person from a distance
I wish my desires were open

out from below the fold
The simple act opening surmounted

I get from here through there
