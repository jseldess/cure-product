('from', 'other')

Then fall then summer from my face
others desires

Falling from this distance
Then I can’t presume to need others

drifting away from the task
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Falling from my face
On the other hand

I get from here through there
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

And from a weak distance
and other types of tracking technology

breaking from my constituents
I presume to others

from no one point
Cereal and others’ health
