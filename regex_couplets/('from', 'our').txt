('from', 'our')

Then fall then summer from my face
conversations with our purchase

from the incoming stream
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling from this distance
reasons resources

drifting away from the task
Two hours and

A person from a distance
or an available resource

The sun shielding from
with four key value pairs

aside from the retinas
or alter of course the time anyway

breaking from my constituents
Who throws contours away

from no one point
phrase them of our possessions
