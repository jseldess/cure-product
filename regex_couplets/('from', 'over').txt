('from', 'over')

Then fall then summer from my face
I step over the edge

Falling from this distance
over the long time up in the sky

drifting away from the task
over the time line I was on

A person from a distance
hovering above standing water

emerging this year from standing water
over the long line up in the sky

Having transitioned from leisure to work
oddly grown over with historic bark

aside from the retinas
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

I get from here through there
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

And from a weak distance
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

breaking from my constituents
for not paying sound overwhelmed

from no one point
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
