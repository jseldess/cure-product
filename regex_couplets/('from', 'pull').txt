('from', 'pull')

Then fall then summer from my face
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Falling from this distance
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

Falling from my face
I’ll pull my data higher up

A person from a distance
I’ll pull myself higher up

The sun shielding from
I’ll pull my data

Having transitioned from leisure to work
