('from', 'purchase')

Then fall then summer from my face
conversations with our purchase

from the incoming stream
in traversing my purchase

from which to step off
purchased out

And from a weak distance
I tell you the weight of my purchases

And from that great distance
until I purchase up the sky

And from a great distance
until I purchase the sky

breaking from my constituents
for my own purchases

from no one point
converting sight into a purchase

and relive from burrowed travels
at the site of a purchase
