('from', 'purpose')

Then fall then summer from my face
by no ventillation my purpose

A person from a distance
until my purpose up in the sky

Having transitioned from leisure to work
until I purpose the horizon

I get from here through there
of my purpose in conversing

get from here through there
In conversing of my purpose

And from a weak distance
I tell you my purposes

And from that great distance
my purpose up in the sky

And from a great distance
I tell you the weight of my purposes

breaking from my constituents
the impulse for my own purposes

from no one point
to the other end of my purpose

and relive from burrowed travels
for my own purposes
