('from', 'reasons')

Then fall then summer from my face
reasons resources

Falling from this distance
with reasons

A person from a distance
with little reasons to aspiration

aside from the retinas
with little reasons to move

from which to step off
Toward the start informally given my reasons

I get from here through there
More reasons around my country 

breaking from my constituents
and could be inflected with reasons
