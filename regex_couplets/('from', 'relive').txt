('from', 'relive')

Then fall then summer from my face
where I send and relive aside

breaking from my constituents
where I send and relive

from no one point
where I send and retrieve relive

and relive from burrowed travels
where I stand and retrieve and relive

from my constituents
where I stand and relive

burrowed about from repeated travels
where I end and relive

radiating from housing
