('from', 'repeated')

Then fall then summer from my face
I reach repeated expressions first

Falling from this distance
I propogated repeated expressions first

from the incoming stream
burrowed about from repeated travels

from cables reheated travels
deep into pathways from repeated travels

from my constituents
