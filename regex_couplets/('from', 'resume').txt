('from', 'resume')

Then fall then summer from my face
and can’t presume to need

Falling from this distance
Then I can’t presume to need others

drifting away from the task
I resume unassimilable visions

I get from here through there
I resume attributable visions

get from here through there
I continue to presume

And from a weak distance
I presume to others

from no one point
So I presume the offers already
