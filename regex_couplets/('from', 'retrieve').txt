('from', 'retrieve')

Then fall then summer from my face
I send and retrieve the impulse

breaking from my constituents
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

from no one point
where I send and retrieve relive

and relive from burrowed travels
where I stand and retrieve and relive

from my constituents
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

burrowed about from repeated travels
