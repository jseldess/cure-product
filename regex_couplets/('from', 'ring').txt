('from', 'ring')

Then fall then summer from my face
interferring 

Falling from this distance
ring

drifting away from the task
hovering above standing water

emerging this year from standing water
actually considering the end

I get from here through there
storing in surfeit

And from a weak distance
firing and connecting somewhere

from my constituents
The prospect for veering healthily
