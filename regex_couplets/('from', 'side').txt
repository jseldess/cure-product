('from', 'side')

Then fall then summer from my face
Iâ€™m simply inside

Falling from this distance
aside from the retinas

from which to step off
actually considering the end

I get from here through there
But my not feeling the memory aside

breaking from my constituents
But my not feeling the memory inside

from no one point
where I am aside at least

and relive from burrowed travels
where I am aside

from my constituents
by the side of the hosting service

burrowed about from repeated travels
But my feeling the memory aside

radiating from housing
