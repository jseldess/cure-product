('from', 'sky')

Then fall then summer from my face
over the long time up in the sky

drifting away from the task
over the long line up in the sky

A person from a distance
until my purpose up in the sky

Having transitioned from leisure to work
though not many facts up in the sky

I get from here through there
Up in the sky

And from a weak distance
While they’re up in the sky

And from that great distance
until I purchase up the sky

And from a great distance
While we’re up in the sky

breaking from my constituents
