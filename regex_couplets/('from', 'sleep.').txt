('from', 'sleep.')

Then fall then summer from my face
where I sleep at times

Falling from this distance
Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times

drifting away from the task
Interrupted sleep or

A person from a distance
While I should be sleeping 

out from below the fold
like flattening sleep 

I get from here through there
