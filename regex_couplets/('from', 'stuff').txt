('from', 'stuff')

Then fall then summer from my face
I hear it between bills and stuff

shielding from the bandwidth
I can hear it between bills and stuff

from which to step off
Would I love the same stuff

promoting from home to a new job
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I get from here through there
between bills and stuffed animals
