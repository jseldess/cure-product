('from', 'tell')

Then fall then summer from my face
Then I constellate my time family country

Falling from this distance
So I constellate the time family country

Falling from my face
I constellate the time

A person from a distance
The CEO tells me to embody values

dislocated and a person from a distance
I had to tell them the news

from which to step off
I tell you my purposes

And from a weak distance
I tell you the weight of my purchases

breaking from my constituents
and that man comes on to tell me 

from no one point
