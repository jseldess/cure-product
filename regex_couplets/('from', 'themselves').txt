('from', 'themselves')

Then fall then summer from my face
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Falling from this distance
talking into pheasants bending themselves

from which to step off
talking into percents bending themselves

I get from here through there
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

and relive from burrowed travels
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

from no one point
battery dawn nights ending themselves

radiating from housing
dawn formerly rights lended themselves
