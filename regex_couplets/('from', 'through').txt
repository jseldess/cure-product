('from', 'through')

Then fall then summer from my face
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling from this distance
Back up through the results

out from below the fold
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I get from here through there
I get here through there

get from here through there
I get through there

And from a weak distance
