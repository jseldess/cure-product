('from', 'time.')

Then fall then summer from my face
only fragments of time with my children

Falling from this distance
over the long time up in the sky

drifting away from the task
So I constellate the time family country

Falling from my face
on the time line I was on

A person from a distance
I spend time online learning to code

dislocated and a person from a distance
On the timeline I was on

shielding from the bandwidth
over the time line I was on

Having transitioned from leisure to work
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

It’s the third letter from the end
The long time I had a vision

from which to step off
without the long time I was accounting

I get from here through there
or alter of course the time anyway

breaking from my constituents
until a happier time found

from no one point
in the long time they were on

shone from the housing
time they were on
