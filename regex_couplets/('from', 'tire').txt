('from', 'tire')

Then fall then summer from my face
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aside from the retinas
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

from which to step off
until I could not tire 

I get from here through there
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

breaking from my constituents
