('from', 'turn')

Then fall then summer from my face
In a sharp downard turn

Falling from this distance
in a sharp downward turn 

Falling from my face
sudden downward turn

A person from a distance
I keep turning back

out from below the fold
who knows how to turn it off

from no one point
I turn not sad exactly

radiating from housing
I return not sad exactly
