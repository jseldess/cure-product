('from', 'until')

Then fall then summer from my face
until my purpose up in the sky

A person from a distance
until I could not tire 

I get from here through there
until I purpose up in the sky

And from a weak distance
until I purchase up the sky

And from that great distance
until I purchase the sky

And from a great distance
until the bill came

breaking from my constituents
until a happier time found

from no one point
