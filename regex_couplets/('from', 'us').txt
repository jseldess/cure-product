('from', 'us')

Then fall then summer from my face
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

from the incoming stream
They’re just not mine

Falling from this distance
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

drifting away from the task
I want to cite a poem so usual

A person from a distance
You use the most essential parts

out from below the fold
The ventillation rushes on

It’s the third letter from the end
I just got a letter

The third letter from the end is mine
So stay with us

aside from the retinas
but it continued rippling muscle

from which to step off
I reuse unassimilable visions

promoting from home to a new job
because there was no solid ground to continue along

from home
I reuse indelible tracks 

I get from here through there
a futile joyous white sun

And from a weak distance
I wear suspenders

And from that great distance
I used my technology

And from a great distance
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

breaking from my constituents
useless for not having paid

from no one point
radiating from housing

shone from the housing
I have them trust in me
