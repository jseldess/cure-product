('from', 'use')

Then fall then summer from my face
You use the most essential parts

out from below the fold
I reuse unassimilable visions

from which to step off
because there was no solid ground to continue along

from home
I reuse indelible tracks 

I get from here through there
I used my technology

And from a weak distance
trackers collecting data on users

breaking from my constituents
useless for not having paid

from no one point
