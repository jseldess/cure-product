('from', 'value')

Then fall then summer from my face
value falling off the edge of the face

Falling from this distance
Then I cannot see face value

Falling from my face
And as an extension of the values

drifting away from the task
The value falling off the edge of the face

A person from a distance
The CEO tells me to embody values

dislocated and a person from a distance
The value falling off the edge of th face

Having transitioned from leisure to work
I see only the back of falling values

aside from the retinas
As an extension of the values

from which to step off
