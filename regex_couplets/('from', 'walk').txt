('from', 'walk')

Then fall then summer from my face
Before we walk across the wide opening

Falling from this distance
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

from the incoming stream
there was no walking along the pleasure

from which to step off
there was no walking along

promoting from home
walking along the measure

walking from home along the measure
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

I get from here through there
