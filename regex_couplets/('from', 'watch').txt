('from', 'watch')

Then fall then summer from my face
when watching tv

aside from the retinas
in the sense of watching

I get from here through there
I watch a movie

get from here through there
I watch a moving afterimage

And from a weak distance
When I'm watching my tv 

from no one point
where Iâ€™m watching my tv

radiating from housing
