('from', 'were')

Then fall then summer from my face
When we had jobs that were to earn

A person from a distance
I wish my desires were open

out from below the fold
I argued the days were longer

aside from the retinas
I argued that the days were longer

from which to step off
The days were long aligned

promoting from home to a new job
they were on

I get from here through there
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

breaking from my constituents
answered about 

from cables reheated travels
formerly a long time they were on

from no one point
I answered about

radiating from housing
in the long time they were on

shone from the housing
I answered while interfaced
