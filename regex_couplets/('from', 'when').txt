('from', 'When')

Then fall then summer from my face
When I want something

from the incoming stream
When we had jobs that were to earn

A person from a distance
When they really take hold of my finger

out from below the fold
When closed to my knowing

And from a weak distance
When I'm watching my tv 

from no one point
