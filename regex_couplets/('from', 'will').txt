('from', 'will')

Then fall then summer from my face
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

Falling from this distance
will not be the same

I get from here through there
would only willingly break

from my constituents
would only speak willingly

with latency from constituents
would speak willingly 

from no one point
my daughter will learn
