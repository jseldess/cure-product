('from', 'work')

Then fall then summer from my face
nor work in this way daily

A person from a distance
Having transitioned from leisure to work

Itâ€™s the third letter from the end
your bid to the next highest ranked network

aside from the retinas
I need the work

I get from here through there
nor envy honest work

breaking from my constituents
