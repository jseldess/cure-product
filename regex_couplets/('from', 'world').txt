('from', 'world')

Then fall then summer from my face
off the edge of the world

Falling from this distance
Which can be pronounced to the world

A person from a distance
off the end of the world

aside from the retinas
hauling off the end of the world

I get from here through there
the opinions in my world

from no one point
