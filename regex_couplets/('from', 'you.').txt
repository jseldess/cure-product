('from', 'you.')

Then fall then summer from my face
Though how can you know without direction

Falling from this distance
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling from my face
if you have providence to excess

A person from a distance
That you can see only the back of

aside from the retinas
since you can imagine movement

from which to step off
where you can earn more 

from home
If you have confidence regardless all else

I get from here through there
a futile joyous white sun

And from a weak distance
I tell you my purposes

And from that great distance
I tell you the weight of my purchases

breaking from my constituents
the young ripples inaudibly
