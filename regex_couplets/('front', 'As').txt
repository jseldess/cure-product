('front', 'As')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
As though stationary and a destination

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
Aspirational strategy

in front of the set afternoon
As an extension of the values

And need out in front purchase
As a clone, illegally conceived

behind or out front or up above
