('front', 'For')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
Forecasting the story before dawn

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
For an ungraspable time

And need out in front purchase
For an ungraspable purchase

behind or out front or up above
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
