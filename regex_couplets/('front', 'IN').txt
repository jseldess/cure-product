('front', 'IN')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON

in front of the set afternoon
ASPIRATING VISIONS

in front of the set of regulations
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

And need out in front purchase
