('front', 'It')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
It has been since

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
Its strategy comes before morning goals

in front of the set afternoon
It’s not marshal exactly

behind or out front or up above
