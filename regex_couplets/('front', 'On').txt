('front', 'On')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
One day there is direction

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
On the bandwidth I was on

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
On the other hand

And need out in front purchase
One was up where it should be down

behind or out front or up above
