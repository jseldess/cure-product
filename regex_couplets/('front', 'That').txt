('front', 'That')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
That’s exaclty what I want for them

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
That’s when they really take

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
That you can see only the back of

in front of the set afternoon
That company creates a life

And need out in front purchase
That I captured an afterimage

behind or out front or up above
