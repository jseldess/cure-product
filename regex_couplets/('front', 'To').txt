('front', 'To')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
To my children Walt Whitman

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
To that impossible place

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
Tomorrow 

in front of the set afternoon
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

And need out in front purchase
To neither study

behind or out front or up above
