('front', 'We')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
We can wrestle them with their goals

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
We had to say goodbye there

And need out in front purchase
We had to buy there

And read out in front
We had inhabited actually

behind or out front or up above
We ask say in that case
