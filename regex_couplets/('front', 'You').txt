('front', 'You')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
You can hear it also through your leisure

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
You use the most essential parts

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

And need out in front purchase
You can have seen offering
