('front', 'air')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Puffs of air

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
and key value pairs

in front of the set of regulations
with key value pairs

in front of the set afternoon
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

behind or out front or up above
