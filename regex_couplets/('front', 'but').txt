('front', 'but')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
but not impart cynicism

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
but the sun isnâ€™t up

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
but it continued

And need out in front purchase
that decisions can be attributable

behind or out front or up above
decisions that can be attributable
