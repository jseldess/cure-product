('front', 'come')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Strategy comes before morning

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
Its strategy comes before morning goals

in front of the set afternoon
and that man comes on to tell me 

behind or out front or up above
and come home to remind inflections
