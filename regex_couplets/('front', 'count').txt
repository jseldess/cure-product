('front', 'count')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Then I constellate my time family country

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
I brought my count down

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
without the long time I was accounting

And need out in front purchase
So I constellate the time family country

behind or out front or up above
