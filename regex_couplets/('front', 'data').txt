('front', 'data')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
I’ll pull my data higher up

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
I’ll pull my data

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
The days of private data

And need out in front purchase
trackers collecting data on users

behind or out front or up above
