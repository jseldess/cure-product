('front', 'day')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
One day there is direction

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
I argued the days felt longer

in front of the set afternoon
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

in front of the set of regulations
The days long aligned

And need out in front purchase
The day

behind or out front or up above
