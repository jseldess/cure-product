('front', 'directly')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
if not directly on my skin

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
But not to me directly

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
The sun high enough to enter directly 

And need out in front purchase
The sun high enough to strike directly
