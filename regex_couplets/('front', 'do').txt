('front', 'do')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
does not feel an exception

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
I brought my qualities down

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
What I do in my liesure

And need out in front purchase
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

behind or out front or up above
I only think I donâ€™t listen
