('front', 'earn')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
When we had jobs that were to earn

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
I spend time online learning to code

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
where you can earn more 

And need out in front purchase
decisioned to learn 

behind or out front or up above
I learned my location
