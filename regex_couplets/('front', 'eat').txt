('front', 'eat')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
Where I put it beating

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
of the habits I create

in front of the set afternoon
of the habits they create

in front of the set of regulations
they create

And need out in front purchase
And from that great distance

behind or out front or up above
