('front', 'goal')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Though there are quarters goals

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
before morning goals

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
Its strategy comes before morning goals

in front of the set afternoon
not goals

in front of the set of regulations
Not goals or tactics

And need out in front purchase
