('front', 'he')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
Some disease effecting the tree out front

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
but the sun isnâ€™t up

in front of the set afternoon
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

in front of the set of regulations
I tried to feel the key values extending 

And need out in front purchase
Under the last principle

And read out in front
Even the children

behind or out front or up above
to the right marking

out front
the right of possessions

in the space out front
in the fill space out front

waiting out front or up above 
the right of surcharge
