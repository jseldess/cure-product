('front', 'head')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Without a head

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
I brought my head down

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
into the next level head

in front of the set of regulations
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

behind or out front or up above
