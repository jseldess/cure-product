('front', 'high')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
way high up in the inter

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
higher up in the results

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
your bid to the next highest ranked network

in front of the set of regulations
The sun high enough to enter directly 

And need out in front purchase
The sun high enough to strike directly
