('front', 'if')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
if not directly on my skin

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
out of the fifth page ruins

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
That company creates a life

And need out in front purchase
if there is anything 

behind or out front or up above
if only on the way to the trash
