('front', 'inter')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
interjecting on a day ambition

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
hold at intervals riding forward

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
with internally regulated climate

in front of the set afternoon
Then I saw them interview

And need out in front purchase
my interfaced stand data

behind or out front or up above
