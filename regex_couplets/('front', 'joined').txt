('front', 'joined')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
I was enjoined to act again myself

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
I was enjoined to act again

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
I was enjoined to act

And need out in front purchase
joined in my television

behind or out front or up above
