('front', 'mine')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Theyâ€™re just not mine

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
The third letter from the end is mine

in front of the set afternoon
The ads in mine

And need out in front purchase
To the right of determined elections

behind or out front or up above
