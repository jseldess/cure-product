('front', 'nor')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
into the minority proportion of time

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
over the long line I would honor

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
the simple act of honoring an accountant

And need out in front purchase
nor work in this way daily

behind or out front or up above
