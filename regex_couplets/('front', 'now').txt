('front', 'now')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
on a snow day with my children

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
out in the snow

in front of the set afternoon
out in the snow fall

in front of the set of regulations
I take it out in the snow fall

And need out in front purchase
knowing the constituents

behind or out front or up above
that their knowing
