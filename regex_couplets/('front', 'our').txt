('front', 'our')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Of course there is a direction

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
or an available resource

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
with four key value pairs

in front of the set of regulations
your bid to the next highest ranked network

in front of the set afternoon
You can hear it also through your leisure

And need out in front purchase
or alter of course the time anyway

behind or out front or up above
phrase them of our possessions
