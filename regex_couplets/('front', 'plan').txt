('front', 'plan')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
and is relentlessly planned

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
The planning process for visions

in front of the set afternoon
The planning process is for visionaries only

in front of the set of regulations
and for which the plan agreed

behind or out front or up above
