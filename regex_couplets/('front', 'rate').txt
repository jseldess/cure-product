('front', 'rate')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
and my heart rate

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
and my heartrate

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
Its strategy comes before morning goals

in front of the set afternoon
and strategies not tactics

in front of the set of regulations
Aspirational strategy

And need out in front purchase
