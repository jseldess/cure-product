('front', 'ring')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
interferring 

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
hovering above standing water

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
actually considering the end

And need out in front purchase
firing and connecting somewhere

behind or out front or up above
The prospect for veering healthily
