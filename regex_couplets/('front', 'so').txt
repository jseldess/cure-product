('front', 'so')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
When I want something

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
A person from a distance

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

in front of the set of regulations
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

And need out in front purchase
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

behind or out front or up above
buy in the sound privacy
