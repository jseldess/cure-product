('front', 'space')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
in rotating directionless space

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
in the space that it had

behind or out front or up above
in the fill space

out front
in the space out front

waiting out front or up above or behind
in the fill space out front

waiting out front or up above
