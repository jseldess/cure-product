('front', 'tell')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Then I constellate my time family country

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
The CEO tells me to embody values

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
I had to tell them the news

And need out in front purchase
I tell you my purposes

behind or out front or up above
