('front', 'their')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
We can wrestle them with their goals

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
I am not allowed to see their face

in front of the set afternoon
their economic value

in front of the set of regulations
increasingly that their economic value

And need out in front purchase
without their agreement

behind or out front or up above
that their knowing
