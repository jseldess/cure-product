('front', 'time.')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
only fragments of time with my children

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
I spend time online learning to code

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

in front of the set afternoon
The long time I had a vision

And need out in front purchase
or alter of course the time anyway

behind or out front or up above
in the long time they were on
