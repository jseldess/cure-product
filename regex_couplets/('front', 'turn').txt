('front', 'turn')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
in a sharp downward turn 

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
I keep turning back

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
who knows how to turn it off

behind or out front or up above
I returned not sad exactly

out front
I returned to location
