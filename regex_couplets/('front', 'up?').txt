('front', 'up?')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
Some disease effecting the tree out front

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
but the sun isnâ€™t up

in front of the set afternoon
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

in front of the set of regulations
with internally regulated climate

And need out in front purchase
For an ungraspable time

And read out in front
Until my purpose 

behind or out front or up above
I returned not sad exactly

out front
waiting out front or up above 

in the space out front
waiting out front or up above or behind

in the fill space out front
sung reflexing
