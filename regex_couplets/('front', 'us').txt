('front', 'us')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
in a continuous vertiginous dream

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
I just got a letter

in front of the set afternoon
So stay with us

And need out in front purchase
Articles all around us

And read out in front
I wear suspenders

behind or out front or up above
I have them trust in me
