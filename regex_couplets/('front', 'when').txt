('front', 'When')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
When I want something

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
When they really take hold of my finger

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
When closed to my knowing

And need out in front purchase
When I'm watching my tv 

behind or out front or up above
