('front', 'work')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
nor work in this way daily

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
your bid to the next highest ranked network

in front of the set of regulations
I need the work

And need out in front purchase
nor envy honest work

behind or out front or up above
