('front', 'you.')

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Though how can you know without direction

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
That you can see only the back of

in front of the set afternoon
your bid to the next highest ranked network

in front of the set of regulations
since you can imagine movement

And need out in front purchase
I tell you my purposes

behind or out front or up above
the young ripples inaudibly
