('full', 'he')

It keeps coming down thankfully
Then fall then summer

I am full of potential
The days are long

with full potential to movement
that I was the arm of this

full of aspirations
The days were long aligned

full of potential
And as an extension of the values

full of the missing words
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

still carefully
Where in me pre-worn
