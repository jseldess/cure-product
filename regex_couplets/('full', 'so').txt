('full', 'so')

It keeps coming down thankfully
When I want something

I am full of potential
with little reason to move

with full potential to movement
my associations

full of aspirations
with little reason to aspiration

full of potential
embodied with little reason

full of the missing words
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

still carefully
so still them
