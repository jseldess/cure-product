('full', 'tire')

It keeps coming down thankfully
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I am full of potential
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

with full potential to movement
until I could not tire 

full of the missing words
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

still carefully
