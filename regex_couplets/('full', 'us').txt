('full', 'us')

It keeps coming down thankfully
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

I am full of potential
So stay with us

full of aspirations
but it continued rippling muscle

full of potential
I reuse unassimilable visions

full of the missing words
a futile joyous white sun

still carefully
in the form filled offered trust
