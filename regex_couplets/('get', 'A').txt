('get', 'A')

I’ll get there eventually
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

and is relentlessly budgeted
And as an extension of the values

I’ll get there ruins
And make myself a visible

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON

I get through there
COPY DREAM 

in traversing get through there
As a clone, illegally conceived

forgetting decisions 
CONTRACT

forgettable
