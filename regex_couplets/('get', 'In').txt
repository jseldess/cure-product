('get', 'IN')

I’ll get there eventually
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

I’ll get there ruins
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON

I get through there
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

forgetting decisions 
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

forgettable
