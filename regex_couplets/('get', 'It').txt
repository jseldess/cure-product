('get', 'It')

I’ll get there eventually
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

and is relentlessly budgeted
It has been since

I’ll get there ruins
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
Its strategy comes before morning goals

I get through there
It’s not marshal exactly

forgetting decisions
