('get', 'That')

I’ll get there eventually
That’s exaclty what I want for them

and is relentlessly budgeted
That’s where I sleep at times

I’ll get there ruins
That you can see only the back of

I get through there
That I captured an afterimage

forgetting decisions 
That are my right to say

forgettable
