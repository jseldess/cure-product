('get', 'There')

I’ll get there eventually
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

and is relentlessly budgeted
There are quarterly goals

I’ll get there ruins
There was very little physical activity

I get through there
There are spots waiting

forgetting decisions 
There are constant ways

forgettable
