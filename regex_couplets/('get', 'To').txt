('get', 'To')

I’ll get there eventually
To my children Walt Whitman

and is relentlessly budgeted
To my chidren

I’ll get there ruins
Tomorrow

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

I get through there
To neither study

forgetting decisions 
To the ends of transactions

forgettable
