('get', 'Which')

I’ll get there eventually
Which is a measure to never live out

and is relentlessly budgeted
Which can be pronounced to the world

I’ll get there ruins
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I get through there
Which can be called confidence

forgetting decisions 
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

forgettable
