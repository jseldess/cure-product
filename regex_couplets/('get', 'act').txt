('get', 'act')

I’ll get there eventually
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

and is relentlessly budgeted
I was enjoined to act again myself

I’ll get there ruins
and strategies not tactics

I get through there
we had inhabited actually

forgetting decisions 
to the ends of my transactions

forgettable
before I act on them

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
