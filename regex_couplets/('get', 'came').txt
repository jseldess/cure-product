('get', 'came')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
I invited most of what came next

I get through there
I came back to me

in traversing get through there
I came after my past

get from here through there
until the bill came

forgetting decisions 
and came home to rewind inflections

forgettable
and came home to rewind

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
