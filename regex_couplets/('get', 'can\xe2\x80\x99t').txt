('get', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

I’ll get there eventually
I can’t fix them without direction

and is relentlessly budgeted
Then I can’t presume to need others

I’ll get there ruins
That can’t be glimpsed

I get through there
Though we can’t help waiting

forgetting decisions 
I can’t remember them

forgettable
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

and maybe forgettable
