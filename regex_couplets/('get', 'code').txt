('get', 'code')

I’ll get there eventually
as long as I have access to the code

and is relentlessly budgeted
May I have your zip code

I’ll get there ruins
learned without too much difficulty to code

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
falling off the encoded end

I get through there
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

forgetting decisions 
zipcode

forgettable
