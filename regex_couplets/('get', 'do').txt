('get', 'do')

I’ll get there eventually
in a sharp downward turn 

and is relentlessly budgeted
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I’ll get there ruins
the dogs and lillies

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
What I do in my liesure

I get through there
here is the site of the battle of maldon

forgetting decisions 
latency which doesn’t mean anything

forgettable
