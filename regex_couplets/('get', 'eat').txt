('get', 'eat')

I’ll get there eventually
too sunny to eat ice cream

and is relentlessly budgeted
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I’ll get there ruins
executive breath

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
of the habits I create

I get through there
And from that great distance

forgetting decisions 
for the creation of the universe

forgettable
