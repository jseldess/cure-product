('get', 'feel')

I’ll get there eventually
conversations with our feelings

and is relentlessly budgeted
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I’ll get there ruins
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I get through there
But my not feeling the memory aside

forgetting decisions 
which feels most comfortable

forgettable
