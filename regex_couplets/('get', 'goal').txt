('get', 'goal')

I’ll get there eventually
Though there are quarters goals

and is relentlessly budgeted
and without quartely goals

and without a proposed budget
There are quarterly goals

I’ll get there ruins
before morning goals

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
Its strategy comes before morning goals

I get through there
