('get', 'he')

I’ll get there eventually
Then I constellate my time family country

and is relentlessly budgeted
In the right sense

Without a proposed budget
Without a head

and without a proposed budget
where I sleep at times

I’ll get there ruins
Then the sun isn’t up 

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
but the sun isn’t up

I get through there
in the sense of watching

I get from here through there
I get here through there

in traversing get through there
under the last seen principle

get from here through there
even when close to my knowing

forgetting decisions 
I presume to others

forgettable
I assume the offers revisitable

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
The sun high enough to strike directly

and maybe forgettable
I assume the offers divisible
