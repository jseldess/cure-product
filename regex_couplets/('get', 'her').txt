('get', 'her')

I’ll get there eventually
where I sleep at times

and is relentlessly budgeted
I’ll pull myself another personality type

I’ll get there ruins
where I can lay claim to ruins

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
there was no promotion

I get through there
I get from here through there

I get here through there
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

in traversing get through there
get from here through there

forgetting decisions 
I presume to others

forgettable
I assume possession to others

and maybe forgettable
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
