('get', 'here')

I’ll get there eventually
where I sleep at times

and is relentlessly budgeted
There are quarterly goals

I’ll get there ruins
where I can lay claim to ruins

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
there was no promotion

I get through there
I get from here through there

I get here through there
in traversing get through there

get from here through there
here is the site of the battle of maldon

forgetting decisions 
Where in me did I host

forgettable
