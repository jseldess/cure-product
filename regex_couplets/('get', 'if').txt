('get', 'if')

I’ll get there eventually
drifting away

and is relentlessly budgeted
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I’ll get there ruins
out of the fifth page ruins

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
That company creates a life

I get through there
If I take a different measure

I get from here through there
If I take some different measure

in traversing get through there
if there is anything 

forgetting decisions 
if that has anything

forgettable
