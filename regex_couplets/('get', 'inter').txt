('get', 'inter')

I’ll get there eventually
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

and is relentlessly budgeted
way high up in the inter

I’ll get there ruins
high up in the internet

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
with internally regulated climate

I get through there
Then I saw them interview

forgetting decisions 
my interfaced stand data

forgettable
