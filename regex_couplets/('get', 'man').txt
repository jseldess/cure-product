('get', 'man')

I’ll get there eventually
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

and is relentlessly budgeted
To my children Walt Whitman

I’ll get there ruins
not many face up

I get through there
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

forgetting decisions 
and that man comes on to tell me 

forgettable
