('get', 'now')

I’ll get there eventually
On a snow day with my children

and is relentlessly budgeted
Right now I’m the cart

I’ll get there ruins
out in the snow

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
out in the snow fall

I get through there
even when close to my knowing

in traversing get through there
When closed to my knowing

forgetting decisions 
who knows the way

forgettable
