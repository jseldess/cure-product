('get', 'others')

I’ll get there eventually
others desires

and is relentlessly budgeted
Then I can’t presume to need others

I’ll get there ruins
I presume to others

forgetting decisions 
Cereal and others’ health

forgettable
I assume possession to others

and maybe forgettable
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
