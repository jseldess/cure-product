('get', 'over')

I’ll get there eventually
I step over the edge

and is relentlessly budgeted
over the long time up in the sky

I’ll get there ruins
hovering above standing water

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
oddly grown over with historic bark

I get through there
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

forgetting decisions 
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

and maybe forgettable
