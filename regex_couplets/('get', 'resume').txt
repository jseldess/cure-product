('get', 'resume')

I’ll get there eventually
and can’t presume to need

and is relentlessly budgeted
Then I can’t presume to need others

I’ll get there ruins
I resume unassimilable visions

I get through there
I resume attributable visions

I get from here through there
I continue to presume

I get here through there
I presume to others

forgetting decisions 
So I presume the offers already

forgettable
I presume the offers

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

and maybe forgettable
