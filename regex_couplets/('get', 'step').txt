('get', 'step')

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
I step off the edge

and is relentlessly budgeted
What the next step

I get through there
step in by the prospect

forgetting decisions 
phase decision step in

forgettable
stepping in the middle

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
stepping off into the middle

and maybe forgettable
