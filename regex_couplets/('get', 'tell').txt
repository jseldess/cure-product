('get', 'tell')

I’ll get there eventually
Then I constellate my time family country

and is relentlessly budgeted
So I constellate the time family country

I’ll get there ruins
I had to tell them the news

I get through there
I tell you my purposes

forgetting decisions 
and that man comes on to tell me 

forgettable
