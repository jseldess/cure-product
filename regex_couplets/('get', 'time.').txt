('get', 'time.')

I’ll get there eventually
Then I constellate my time family country

and is relentlessly budgeted
where I sleep at times

I’ll get there ruins
On the timeline I was on

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

I get through there
the long time I was on

I get from here through there
or alter of course the time anyway

forgetting decisions 
formerly a long time they were on

forgettable
