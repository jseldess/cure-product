('get', 'up?')

I’ll get there eventually
Then I constellate my time family country

and is relentlessly budgeted
Without a proposed budget

and without a proposed budget
But not to impart cynicism

I’ll get there ruins
Then the sun isn’t up 

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
but the sun isn’t up

I get through there
If I take a different measure

I get from here through there
I get here through there

in traversing get through there
under the last seen principle

get from here through there
In conversing of my purpose

forgetting decisions 
I presume to others

forgettable
I assume the offers revisitable

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
that decisions can be attributable

and maybe forgettable
I assume the offers divisible
