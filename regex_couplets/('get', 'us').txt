('get', 'us')

I’ll get there eventually
asynchronous 

and is relentlessly budgeted
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I’ll get there ruins
The ventillation rushes on

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
I just got a letter

I get through there
I have them trust in me

I get from here through there
a futile joyous white sun

forgetting decisions 
in the form filled offered in trust

forgettable
