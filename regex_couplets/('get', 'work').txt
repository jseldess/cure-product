('get', 'work')

I’ll get there eventually
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

and is relentlessly budgeted
nor work in this way daily

I’ll get there ruins
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
your bid to the next highest ranked network

I get through there
nor envy honest work

forgetting decisions
