('goals', 'It')

Though there are quarters goals
It has been since

before morning goals
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
It’s morning 

Its strategy comes before morning goals
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

not goals
It’s not marshal exactly
