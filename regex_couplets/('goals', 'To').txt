('goals', 'To')

Though there are quarters goals
To my children Walt Whitman

and without quartely goals
To my chidren

There are quarterly goals
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

before morning goals
Tomorrow

Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
Toward the start informally given my reasons
