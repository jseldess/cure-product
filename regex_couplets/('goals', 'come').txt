('goals', 'come')

Though there are quarters goals
Strategy comes before morning

Before morning goals
after having been contented Strategy comes before morning

Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
Its strategy comes before morning goals

Strategy comes before goals
and that man comes on to tell me
