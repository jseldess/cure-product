('goals', 'goal')

Though there are quarters goals
We can wrestle them with their goals

We can rest there in them with their goals
with goals

though there are quarters with goals
with goals I find there

and without quartely goals
There are quarterly goals

before morning goals
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

Its strategy comes before morning goals
Strategy comes before goals

not goals
Not goals or tactics
