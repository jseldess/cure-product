('goals', 'he')

Though there are quarters goals
They’re just not mine

We can wrestle them with their goals
We can rest there in them with their goals

with goals
I step over the edge

though there are quarters with goals
with goals I find there

and without quartely goals
Then I constellate my time family country

There are quarterly goals
There are performance reviews

before morning goals
Then I cannot see face value

Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
Then the sun isn’t up

Its strategy comes before morning goals
but the sun isn’t up

Strategy comes before goals
out in the snow

not goals
What the next step

Not goals or tactics
The planning process is for visionaries only
