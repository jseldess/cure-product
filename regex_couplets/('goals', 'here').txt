('goals', 'here')

Though there are quarters goals
Actually one day there is direction

We can wrestle them with their goals
We can rest there in them with their goals

with goals
though there are quarters with goals

with goals I find there
what I find there

and without quartely goals
where I sleep at times

There are quarterly goals
There are performance reviews

before morning goals
there was no promotion
