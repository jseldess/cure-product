('goals', 'rate')

Though there are quarters goals
and my heart rate

before morning goals
Strategy comes before morning

Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
Its strategy comes before morning goals

Strategy comes before goals
and strategies not tactics

not goals
Aspirational strategy

Not goals or tactics
I aspirate with little vision
