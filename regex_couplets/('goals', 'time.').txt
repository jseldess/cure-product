('goals', 'time.')

Though there are quarters goals
where I sleep at times

and without quartely goals
Then I constellate my time family country

There are quarterly goals
at any time it can drift again

before morning goals
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

not goals
The long time I had a vision
