('goals', 'up?')

Though there are quarters goals
They’re just not mine

We can wrestle them with their goals
there are quarters 

We can rest there in them with their goals
Though how can you know without direction

With goals 
though there are quarters with goals

with goals I find there
for how can you know without direction

and without quartely goals
and without a proposed budget

There are quarterly goals
And as an extension of the values

before morning goals
barely outlines

Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
Then the sun isn’t up

Its strategy comes before morning goals
but the sun isn’t up

Strategy comes before goals
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

not goals
of my economic value

Not goals or tactics
your bid to the next highest ranked network
