('going', 'All')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
All of the time

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
All that I can think I want

The way that she is going
All parties would be held for my own purchases

The way that I am going
All that I own messageable
