('going', 'For')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
For an ungraspable time

The way that she is going
For my own purchases

The way that I am going
Formerly a way like this one

The way that I was going
Formerly away there are constant ways

way I was going 
Forty-one seconds in

A way I was going
For a while I think I don’t listen
