('going', 'Having')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Having transitioned from leisure to work

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
Having been purchased out of you

The way that she is going
Having seen more than 

The way that I am going
Having seen more than I can remember
