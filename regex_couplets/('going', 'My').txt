('going', 'My')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
My associations

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
My purpose up in the sky

The way that she is going
My daughter with her way

The way that I am going
My daughter helps too

the way that I was going
My say to the elections
