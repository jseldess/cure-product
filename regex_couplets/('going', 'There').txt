('going', 'There')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

The way that she is going
There are constant ways

The way that I was going
There are no constant waves

way I was going
