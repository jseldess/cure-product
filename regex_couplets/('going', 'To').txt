('going', 'To')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
To my children Walt Whitman

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
Tomorrow

The way that she is going
To the ends of transactions

The way that I am going
To the ends of my transactions

the way that I was going
To the other end of transactions

way I was going 
To the right of determined elections
