('going', 'Which')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Which is a measure to never live out

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
Which is a pleasure to never live out

The way that she is going
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

The way that I am going
