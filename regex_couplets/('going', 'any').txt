('going', 'any')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
not many face up

The way that she is going
latency which doesn’t mean anything

The way that I am going
The many transparent pixel calls

The way that I was going
or imagined anyway
