('going', 'battery')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
battery dawn nights 

the way that I was going
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

way I was going 
battery dawn nights ending themselves
