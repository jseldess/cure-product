('going', 'blend')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
walking into percents blending themselves

The way that she is going
where I blend and relive

The way that I am going
where lights blended themselves
