('going', 'but')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
but they are black spots

The way that she is going
that decisions can be attributable

The way that I am going
but for memory elsewhere
