('going', 'call')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
not calling or echoing for once

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
though it was most emphatically that

The way that she is going
to take the call

The way that I am going
The many transparent pixel calls

The way that I was going
recalling aside
