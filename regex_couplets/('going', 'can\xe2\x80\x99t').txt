('going', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I can’t fix them without direction

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
Though we can’t help waiting

The way that I was going
Though we can’t help waiting for her

way I was going 
I can’t remember them
