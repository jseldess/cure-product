('going', 'case')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
only in the case

The way that she is going
I ask say in that case

The way that I am going
we ask say in that case
