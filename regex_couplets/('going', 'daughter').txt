('going', 'daughter')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I love my daughter still

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
with my daughter

The way that I am going
My daughter with her way

The way that I was going
My daughter helps too

way I was going 
my daughter will learn
