('going', 'decisions')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
the planning process for decisions

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
attributable decisions

The way that she is going
forgetting decisions 

The way that I am going
that decisions can be attributable
