('going', 'do')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
What I do in my liesure

The way that she is going
and it doesn’t take long

The way that I am going
I only think I don’t listen
