('going', 'eat')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
too sunny to eat ice cream

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
it was not just a defeat

The way that she is going
for the creation of the universe

The way that I am going
burrowed about from repeated travels
