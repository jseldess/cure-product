('going', 'else')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
If you have confidence regardless all else

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

The way that she is going
elsewhere by my memory

The way that I am going
By my memory elsewhere
