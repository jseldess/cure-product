('going', 'ending')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
talking into pheasants bending themselves

The way that she is going
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

The way that I am going
battery dawn nights ending themselves
