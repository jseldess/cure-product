('going', 'he')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
talking into pheasants bending themselves

The way that she is going
The constituents would be helped

The way that I am going
But my not feeling the memory inside

The way that I was going
Though we are waiting for her

way I was going 
with constant ways to the other end

A way I was going
to the other end of actions
