('going', 'here')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Of course there is a direction

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
Where I take my liesure

The way that she is going
where I send and relive would be held

The way that I am going
Is there a baby and a bear

The way that I was going
There are constant ways

way I was going 
where rights ended themselves
