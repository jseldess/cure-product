('going', 'man')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
not many face up

The way that she is going
and that man comes on to tell me 

The way that I am going
The many transparent pixel calls

The way that I was going
