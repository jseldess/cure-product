('going', 'mean')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
What does it mean to drift

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
My means without gravity

The way that she is going
latency which doesn’t mean anything

The way that I am going
The other end of means

The way that I was going
To the other end of means like this one

way I was going
