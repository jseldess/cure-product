('going', 'move')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
since I can imagine movement

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

The way that she is going
myself moved literally as it is

The way that I am going
not literally moved about
