('going', 'pulse')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
impulse control

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
I send and retrieve the impulse

The way that she is going
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

The way that I am going
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

The way that I was going
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

way I was going 
I stand and retrieve and pulse around
