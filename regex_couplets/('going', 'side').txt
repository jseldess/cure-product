('going', 'side')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
actually considering the end

The way that she is going
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

The way that I am going
But my not feeling the memory inside

The way that I was going
By my feeling the memory inside

way I was going 
44 seconds inside
