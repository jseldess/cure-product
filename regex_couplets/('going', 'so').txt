('going', 'so')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
If I take some different measure

The way that she is going
sound inundated for my own purchases

The way that I am going
by in the sound privacy
