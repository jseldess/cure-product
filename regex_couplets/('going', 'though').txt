('going', 'though')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
As though stationary and a destination

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
though not many freeze up

The way that she is going
though we are breaking in the space that it had

The way that I am going
I thought
