('going', 'time.')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
The long time I had a vision

The way that she is going
until a happier time found

The way that I am going
formerly along time they were on
