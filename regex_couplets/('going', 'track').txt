('going', 'track')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I reuse indelible tracks 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
and other types of tracking technology

The way that she is going
which as tracked befitted 

The way that I am going
which as tracked befitted phased
