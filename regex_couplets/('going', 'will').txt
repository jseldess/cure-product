('going', 'will')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
will not be the same

The way that she is going
would only willingly break

The way that I am going
my daughter will learn
