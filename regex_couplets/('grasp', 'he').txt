('grasp', 'he')

having been graspable
I get through there

having been an ungraspable time
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

Under the grasp principle
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

for an ungraspable purchase
My purpose up in the sky

For an ungraspable time
Under the past prinicple

And for an ungraspable time
they can be waived
