('grasp', 'here')

having been graspable
I get through there

having been an ungraspable time
And we had to say goodbye to her there

for an ungraspable purchase
We had to say goodbye there

under the grasp principle
We had to buy there

For an ungraspable time
 of those gathered

And for an ungraspable time
Or in some imaginary elsewhere
