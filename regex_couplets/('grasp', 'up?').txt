('grasp', 'up?')

having been graspable
that can be attributable

having been an ungraspable time
I continue to consume

Under the grasp principle
I could in effect credit

for an ungraspable purchase
My purpose up in the sky

For an ungraspable time
articles all around us

And for an ungraspable time
I have supporters
