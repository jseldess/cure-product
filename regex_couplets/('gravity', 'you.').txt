('gravity', 'you.')

and testing the edge and gravity
That you can see only the back of

where I need gravity
I tell you my purposes

Where I lead gravity
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I tell you where I need gravity
I tell you the weight of my purposes

that nothing had gravity
a futile joyous white sun
