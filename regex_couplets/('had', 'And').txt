('had', 'And')

If he had not carried one virtue
And as an extension of the values

I had me a vision
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

we had to say goodbye
And we had to say goodbye to her there

We had to say goodbye there
And need out in front purchase

We had to buy there
And read out in front

that nothing had gravity
And we could inhabit the room easy

in the space that it had
