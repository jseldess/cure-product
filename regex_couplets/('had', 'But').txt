If he had not carried one virtue
Attributable or

I had me a vision
but the sun isnâ€™t up

Since I had to hold the entire company
but it continued

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
but it continued rippling muscle

I had to tell them the news
but would I love her the same

The long time I had a vision
but they are black spots

I had a vision
I resume attributable visions

we had to say goodbye
that decisions can be attributable

I had entered my phone
but for memory elsewhere
