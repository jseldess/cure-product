('had', 'For')

If he had not carried one virtue
Forecasting the story before dawn

I had me a vision
For an ungraspable time

We had to say goodbye there
For an ungraspable purchase

And we had to say goodbye to her there
For Mitt Romney

in the face that I had
For my own purchases

in the space that it had
Formerly a way like this one

I had entered my phone
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
