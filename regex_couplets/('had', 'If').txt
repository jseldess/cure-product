('had', 'if')

If he had not carried one virtue
if you have providence to excess

When we had jobs that were to earn
out of the fifth page ruins

I had me a vision
learned without too much difficulty to code

Since I had to hold the entire company
That company creates a life

I had to tell them the news
Life is with people

The long time I had a vision
If I take a different measure

I had a vision
If I take some different measure

we had to say goodbye
if there is anything 

We had inhabited actually
if you have providence

in the face that I had
if that has anything

in the space that it had
if only on the way to the trash
