('had', 'so')

If he had not carried one virtue
I want to cite a poem so usual

When we had jobs that were to earn
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

when we had jobs that was to churn some bread
A person from a distance

I had me a vision
or an available resource

Since I had to hold the entire company
My associations

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
with little reason to move

I had to tell them the news
with little reason to aspiration

The long time I had a vision
no solid ground to continue along

I had a vision
If I take some different measure

we had to say goodbye
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

that nothing had gravity
so that nothing had gravity

we had inhabited actually
You can hear it also through your leisure

in the face that I had
sound inundated for my own purchases

in the space that it had
and sound redundant

which had on honor to be told
for not paying sound overwhelmed

in the face that it had
so still watch them

I had entered my phone
buy in the sound privacy
