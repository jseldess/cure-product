('had', 'THE')

If he had not carried one virtue
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

When we had jobs that were to earn
THE SNOW

I had me a vision
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

Since I had to hold the entire company
THE OFFERS

The long time I had a vision
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

we had to say goodbye
