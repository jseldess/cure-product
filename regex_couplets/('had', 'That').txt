('had', 'That')

If he had not carried one virtue
Thatâ€™s when they really take

I had me a vision
That you can see only the back of

Since I had to hold the entire company
That company creates a life

I had to tell them the news
That I captured an afterimage

so that nothing had gravity
That are my right to say
