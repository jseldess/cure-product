('had', 'There')

If he had not carried one virtue
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

When we had jobs that were to earn
There was very little physical activity

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
There are spots waiting

that nothing had gravity
There are constant ways

I had entered my phone
