('had', 'Thou')

If he had not carried one virtue
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

The long time I had a vision
Though in not many acts

I had a vision
Though we are waiting for her

We had inhabited actually
Though we are breaking 

in the space that it had
Though we are waiting 

I had me a vision
Though we can’t help waiting

I had entered my phone
