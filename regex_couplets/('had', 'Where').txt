('had', 'Where')

If he had not carried one virtue
Where official policy is to catch and release

I had me a vision
Where I take my liesure

The long time I had a vision
Where I lead gravity

that nothing had gravity
Where in me did I host

in the space that it had
Where I host my purposes

in the face that I had
Where in me did I last

which had on honor to be told
Where in me did I lose

I had entered my phone
