('had', 'You')

If he had not carried one virtue
You can hear it also through your leisure

When we had jobs that were to earn
You use the most essential parts

I had me a vision
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

The long time I had a vision
You can hear it also through static leisure

I had a vision
You can have seen offering
