('had', 'act')

If he had not carried one virtue
I was enjoined to act again

I had me a vision
I was enjoined to act again myself

Since I had to hold the entire company
I am enjoined to act again

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
I was enjoying acting against myself

I had nightmares though
There was very little physical activity

I had to tell them the news
actually considering the end

The long time I had a vision
I refuse indelible tracts

I had a vision
we had inhabited actually

in the space that it had
to the ends of my transactions

in the face that I had
The ends of my transactions

which had on honor to be told
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

in the face that it had
To the ends of transactions

I had entered my phone
I return not sad exactly
