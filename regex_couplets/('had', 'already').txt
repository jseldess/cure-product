('had', 'already')

If he had not carried one virtue
already formerly a long time

We had inhabited actually
dawn already formerly nights 

in the face that I had
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

in the space that it had
already formely a long time

which had on honor to be told
with dawn already formerly nights 

I had me a vision
So I presume the offers already
