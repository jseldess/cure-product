('had', 'also')

If he had not carried one virtue
You can hear it also through your leisure

When we had jobs that were to earn
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

The long time I had a vision
I cannot clear it also through investiture

I had a vision
also didnâ€™t really move

I had entered my phone
