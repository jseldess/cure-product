('had', 'any')

If he had not carried one virtue
Or the company

I had me a vision
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

Since I had to hold the entire company
The days aligned for company

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
The days aligned long company

I had to tell them the news
That company creates a life

The long time I had a vision
there wasn’t any television 

I had a vision
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

we had to say goodbye
without any further damage

so that nothing had gravity
without any longer damage

we had inhabited actually
or alter of course the time anyway

in the space that it had
if there is anything 

in the face that I had
latency which doesn’t mean anything

in the face that it had
The many transparent pixel calls

I had entered my phone
or imagined anyway
