('had', 'are')

If he had not carried one virtue
barely outlines

I had me a vision
The days are long

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
I had nightmares though

I had to tell them the news
but they are black spots

The long time I had a vision
I believe I can prepare for it

I had a vision
There are spots waiting

that nothing had gravity
Though we are waiting for her

We had inhabited actually
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

in the face that I had
though we are still breaking in

though we are breaking in the space that it had
Though we are breaking 

in the space that it had
Though we are waiting 

in the face that it had
still carefully

I had entered my phone
That are my right to say
