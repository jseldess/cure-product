('had', 'argued')

If he had not carried one virtue
I argued the days felt longer

I had me a vision
I argued the days were longer

Since I had to hold the entire company
or argued for them at least

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
I argued that the days were longer

I had to tell them the news
