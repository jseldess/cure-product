('had', 'around')

If he had not carried one virtue
Spinning around the heart

I had me a vision
around my country 

The long time I had a vision
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

we had to say goodbye
articles all around us

We had to say goodbye there
articles all around storming around

We had to buy there
around the dogs and lillies

that nothing had gravity
More reasons around my country 

in the face that I had
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

which had on honor to be told
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

I had entered my phone
