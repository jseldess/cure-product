('had', 'aside')

If he had not carried one virtue
aside from the retinas

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
But my not feeling the memory aside

in the face that I had
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

in the space that it had
where I send and relive aside

which had on honor to be told
where I send and retrieve aside

I had entered my phone
