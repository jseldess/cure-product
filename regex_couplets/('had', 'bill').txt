('had', 'bill')

If he had not carried one virtue
I hear it between bills and stuff

I had me a vision
I can hear it between bills and stuff

The long time I had a vision
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I had a vision
billowing in the cloud

we had to say goodbye
until the bill came

we had inhabited actually
the bill my detuning
