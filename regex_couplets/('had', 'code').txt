('had', 'code')

If he had not carried one virtue
May I have your zip code

I had me a vision
learned without too much difficulty to code

Since I had to hold the entire company
falling off the encoded end

The long time I had a vision
encoded off the end

I had a vision
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

that nothing had gravity
zipcode

I had entered my phone
