('had', 'company')

If he had not carried one virtue
Or the company

I had me a vision
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

Since I had to hold the entire company
The days aligned for company

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
The days aligned long company

I had to tell them the news
That company creates a life

The long time I had a vision
