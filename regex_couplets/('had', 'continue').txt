('had', 'continue')

If he had not carried one virtue
but it continued

Since I had to hold the entire company
but it continued rippling muscle

I had me a vision
no solid ground to continue along

The long time I had a vision
I continue to presume

we had to say goodbye
Then I continue to dream then

that nothing had gravity
I continued to dream then

so that nothing had gravity
