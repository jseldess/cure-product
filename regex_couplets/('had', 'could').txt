('had', 'could')

If he had not carried one virtue
and could be mapped and weighed

I had me a vision
until I could not tire 

The long time I had a vision
until I could not be tired

I had a vision
I could in effect credit

we had to say goodbye
I could consume the dream

that nothing had gravity
and we could inhabit the room easy

We had inhabited actually
and could be inflected with reasons
