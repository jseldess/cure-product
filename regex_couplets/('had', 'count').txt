('had', 'count')

If he had not carried one virtue
So I constellate the time family country

When we had jobs that were to earn
I brought my count down

I had me a vision
without the long time I was accounting

The long time I had a vision
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I had a vision
without the long time I was on accounting

we had to say goodbye
More reasons around my country 

in the face that I had
