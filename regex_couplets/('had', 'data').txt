('had', 'data')

If he had not carried one virtue
Iâ€™ll pull my data higher up

I had me a vision
The days of private data

I had to tell them the news
The days of public data

The long time I had a vision
trackers collecting data on users

in the face that I had
my interfaced stand data

I had entered my phone
my standing in data
