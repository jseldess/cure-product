('had', 'dawn')

If he had not carried one virtue
Forecasting the story before dawn

I had me a vision
battery dawn nights blending themselves

we had to say goodbye
dawn already formerly nights 

We had inhabited actually
dawn formerly

which had on honor to be told
with dawn already formerly nights 

in the space that it had
battery dawn nights 

I had entered my phone
battery dawn nights ending themselves
