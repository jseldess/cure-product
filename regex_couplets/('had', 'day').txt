('had', 'day')

If he had not carried one virtue
I argued the days felt longer

I had me a vision
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

Since I had to hold the entire company
The days long aligned

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
The days are long

I had to tell them the news
The days were long aligned

The long time I had a vision
The day

we had inhabited actually
between that day

in the space that it had
I have a memory between the day

in the face that I had
at least most days

I had entered my phone
