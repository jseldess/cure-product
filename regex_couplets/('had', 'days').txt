('had', 'days')

If he had not carried one virtue
I argued the days felt longer

I had me a vision
The days long aligned

Since I had to hold the entire company
I argued the days were longer

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
The days are long

I had to tell them the news
The days were long aligned

The long time I had a vision
at least most days

I had entered my phone
