('had', 'do')

If he had not carried one virtue
I brought my head down

I had me a vision
the dogs and lillies

Since I had to hold the entire company
What I do in my liesure

The long time I had a vision
Undoubtedly 

I had a vision
here is the site of the battle of maldon

we had to say goodbye
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

that nothing had gravity
and it doesn’t take long

which had on honor to be told
latency which doesn’t mean anything

in the space that it had
I only think I don’t listen
