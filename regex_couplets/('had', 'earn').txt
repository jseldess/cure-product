('had', 'earn')

If he had not carried one virtue
When we had jobs that were to earn

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
I spend time online learning to code

I had me a vision
learned without too much difficulty to code

Since I had to hold the entire company
where you can earn more 

The long time I had a vision
decisioned to learn 

in the space that it had
decisioned to learn back

I had entered my phone
I learned my location
