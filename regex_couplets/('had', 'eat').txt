('had', 'eat')

If he had not carried one virtue
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

When we had jobs that were to earn
was not just a defeat

I had me a vision
executive breath

Since I had to hold the entire company
That company creates a life

I had to tell them the news
it was not just a defeat

The long time I had a vision
And from that great distance

that nothing had gravity
for the creation of the universe

which had on honor to be told
burrowed about from repeated travels

I had entered my phone
