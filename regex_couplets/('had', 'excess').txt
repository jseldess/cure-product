('had', 'excess')

If he had not carried one virtue
if you have providence to excess

When we had jobs that were to earn
not one virtue to excess

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
Did he carry one virtue to excess

I had me a vision
If articles can storm in excess

we had to say goodbye
