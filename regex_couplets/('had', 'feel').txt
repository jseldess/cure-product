('had', 'feel')

If he had not carried one virtue
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I had me a vision
I tried to feel the extension of key values

Since I had to hold the entire company
What would I feel without that goal

The long time I had a vision
But my not feeling the memory aside

in the face that I had
But my not feeling the memory inside

which had on honor to be told
which feels most comfortable

in the space that it had
which feels more comfortable

in the face that it had
which is what feels most comfortable

I had entered my phone
which I feel formerly about for
