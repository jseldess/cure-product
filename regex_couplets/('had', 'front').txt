('had', 'front')

If he had not carried one virtue
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

I had me a vision
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Since I had to hold the entire company
And need out in front purchase

We had to say goodbye there
And read out in front

And we had to say goodbye to her there
behind or out front or up above
