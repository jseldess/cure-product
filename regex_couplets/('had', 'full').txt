('had', 'full')

If he had not carried one virtue
I am full of potential

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
with full potential to movement

I had nightmares though
full of aspirations

I had to tell them the news
full of potential

I had me a vision
full of the missing words

we had inhabited actually
still carefully

I had entered my phone
