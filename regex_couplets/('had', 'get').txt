('had', 'get')

If he had not carried one virtue
I’ll get there eventually

When we had jobs that were to earn
I’ll get there ruins

I had me a vision
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Since I had to hold the entire company
I get through there

we had to say goodbye
forgetting decisions 

in the space that it had
forgettable
