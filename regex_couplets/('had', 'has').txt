('had', 'has')

If he had not carried one virtue
It has been since

When we had jobs that were to earn
in traversing my purchase

The long time I had a vision
purchased out

we had to say goodbye
Under the last principle of purchasing power

And we had to say goodbye to her there
for an ungraspable purchase

We had to say goodbye there
And need out in front purchase

We had to buy there
Having been purchased out of you

I had me a vision
until I purchase up the sky

that nothing had gravity
if that has anything

We had inhabited actually
I have entered my purchases

in the face that I had
for my own purchases

though we are breaking in the space that it had
found dated for my own purchases

in the space that it had
impulse for my own purchases

which had on honor to be told
phase decisioned by the prospect

I had entered my phone
at the site of a purchase
