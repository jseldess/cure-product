('had', 'have')

If he had not carried one virtue
if you have providence to excess

When we had jobs that were to earn
If you have confidence regardless all else

I had me a vision
I have them lost

we had to say goodbye
I have supporters

that nothing had gravity
I have a memory between the day

We had inhabited actually
I have entered my purposes

in the face that I had
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

in the space that it had
I have entered my phone

I had entered my phone
I have them trust in me
