('had', 'he')

If he had not carried one virtue
The world 

When we had jobs that were to earn
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

when we had jobs that was to churn some bread
Did he carry one virtue to excess

I had me a vision
there was no promotion

Since I had to hold the entire company
The days long aligned

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
that I was the arm of this

I had to tell them the news
And as an extension of the values

The long time I had a vision
without the long time I was accounting

I had a vision
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

we had to say goodbye
Under the last principle of purchasing power

And we had to say goodbye to her there
she lay under the grass

We had to say goodbye there
under the grasp principle

We had to buy there
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

that nothing had gravity
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

so that nothing had gravity
without any further damage

we had inhabited actually
and we could inhabit the room easy

in the space that it had
all parties would be held

in the face that I had
people would be helped

though we are breaking in the space that it had
where I send and relive would be held

which had on honor to be told
for not paying sound overwhelmed

in the face that it had
Where in me did I lose

I had entered my phone
battery dawn nights blending themselves
