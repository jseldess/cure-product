('had', 'hear')

If he had not carried one virtue
You can hear it also through your leisure

When we had jobs that were to earn
and my heart rate

I had me a vision
I hear it between bills and stuff

Since I had to hold the entire company
I can hear it between bills and stuff

The long time I had a vision
that I can hear

I had a vision
In my heart did I lose trust

I had entered my phone
