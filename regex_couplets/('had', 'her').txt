('had', 'her')

If he had not carried one virtue
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

When we had jobs that were to earn
To neither study

I had me a vision
there was no promotion

Since I had to hold the entire company
There was very little physical activity

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
that potential is there for you

I had to tell them the news
but would I love her the same

The long time I had a vision
Where I take my liesure

I had a vision
I get through there

we had to say goodbye
And we had to say goodbye to her there

We had to say goodbye there
We had to buy there

that nothing had gravity
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

so that nothing had gravity
without any further damage

we had inhabited actually
Though we are waiting for her

in the space that it had
if there is anything 

in the face that I had
where I send and relive would be held

which had on honor to be told
Where in me did I host

in the face that it had
Where in me did I lose

I had entered my phone
By my memory elsewhere
