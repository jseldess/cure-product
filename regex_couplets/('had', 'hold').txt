('had', 'hold')

If he had not carried one virtue
I take hold of my finger

When we had jobs that were to earn
When they really take hold of my finger

I had me a vision
Since I had to hold the entire company

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
and hold and wish to hold

we had to say goodbye
designed to hold up my underwear

that nothing had gravity
