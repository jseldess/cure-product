('had', 'impulse')

If he had not carried one virtue
impulse control

I had me a vision
I send and retrieve the impulse

in the face that I had
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

in the space that it had
I stand and retrieve the impulse

which had on honor to be told
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

I had entered my phone
