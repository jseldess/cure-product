('had', 'learn')

If he had not carried one virtue
I spend time online learning to code

I had me a vision
learned without too much difficulty to code

Since I had to hold the entire company
decisioned to learn 

in the space that it had
decisioned to learn back

I had entered my phone
I learned my location
