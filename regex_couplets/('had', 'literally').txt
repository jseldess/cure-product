('had', 'literally')

If he had not carried one virtue
and literally moved

We had inhabited actually
as it was designed literally

in the space that it had
and literally unproved

which had on honor to be told
myself moved literally as it is

I had me a vision
literally moved

in the face that it had
what literally moved

I had entered my phone
not literally moved
