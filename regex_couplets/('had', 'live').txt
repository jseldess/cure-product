('had', 'live')

If he had not carried one virtue
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

When we had jobs that were to earn
Which is a pleasure to never live out

The long time I had a vision
where I send and relive aside

in the face that I had
where I send and relive would be held

in the space that it had
where I stand and relive

which had on honor to be told
where I send and relive

I had entered my phone
