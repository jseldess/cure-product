('had', 'longer')

If he had not carried one virtue
I argued the days felt longer

I had me a vision
I argued the days were longer

Since I had to hold the entire company
I argued that the days were longer

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
without longer damage

so that nothing had gravity
without any longer damage

we had inhabited actually
