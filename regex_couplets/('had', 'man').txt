('had', 'man')

If he had not carried one virtue
not many face up

The long time I had a vision
though not many facts up in the sky

I had a vision
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

we had inhabited actually
They have very many choices

in the face that I had
and that man comes on to tell me 

I had me a vision
The many transparent pixel calls

I had entered my phone
