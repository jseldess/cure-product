('had', 'move')

If he had not carried one virtue
since I can imagine movement

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
with full potential to movement

I had nightmares though
since you can imagine movement

I had to tell them the news
with little reason to move

I had me a vision
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

we had to say goodbye
and literally moved

We had inhabited actually
myself moved literally as it is

in the space that it had
I move

in the face that it had
what literally moved

I had entered my phone
not literally moved
