('had', 'movement')

If he had not carried one virtue
since I can imagine movement

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
with full potential to movement

I had nightmares though
since you can imagine movement

I had to tell them the news
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

we had to say goodbye
