('had', 'myself')

If he had not carried one virtue
I keep turning back again myself

I had me a vision
I was enjoined to act again myself

Since I had to hold the entire company
off the end myself

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
I was enjoying acting against myself

I had nightmares though
myself

in the space that it had
the least productive of myself

I had entered my phone
So I find myself at home
