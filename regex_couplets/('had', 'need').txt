('had', 'need')

If he had not carried one virtue
I need the work

The long time I had a vision
I need an explicit statement

I had a vision
And need out in front purchase

We had to say goodbye there
where I need gravity

I had me a vision
I tell you where I need gravity

that nothing had gravity
not needing to wait

which had on honor to be told
without really needing

in the space that it had
in need one in that best own

I had entered my phone
need one in best own
