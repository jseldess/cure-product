('had', 'night')

If he had not carried one virtue
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

When we had jobs that were to earn
blue and sun again a second, then night

I had me a vision
I had nightmares though

I had to tell them the news
battery dawn nights blending themselves

we had to say goodbye
dawn already formerly nights 

We had inhabited actually
last night

which had on honor to be told
with dawn already formerly nights 

in the space that it had
battery dawn nights 

I had entered my phone
battery dawn nights ending themselves
