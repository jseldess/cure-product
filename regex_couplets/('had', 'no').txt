('had', 'no')

If he had not carried one virtue
which can be pronounced 

When we had jobs that were to earn
not one virtue to excess

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
for not voting for him

when we had jobs that was to churn some bread
Which can be pronounced to the world

I had me a vision
there was no promotion

Since I had to hold the entire company
I take it out in the snow fall

The long time I had a vision
may not be ingrained

I had a vision
even when close to my knowing

we had to say goodbye
I used my technology

that nothing had gravity
so that nothing had gravity

we had inhabited actually
The sun high enough to enter directly

in the face that I had
not speaking

though we are breaking in the space that it had
But my not feeling the memory aside

in the space that it had
But my not feeling the memory inside

which had on honor to be told
for not paying redundant

in the face that it had
who knows the way

I had entered my phone
between cereal and economic
