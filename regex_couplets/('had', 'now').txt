('had', 'now')

If he had not carried one virtue
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

I had me a vision
I take it out in the snow fall

The long time I had a vision
I even know what I would find

I had a vision
even when close to my knowing

we had to say goodbye
knowing the constituents

which had on honor to be told
who knows the way

I had entered my phone
that their knowing
