('had', 'other')

If he had not carried one virtue
I’ll pull myself another personality type

I had me a vision
On the other hand

The long time I had a vision
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

we had to say goodbye
and other types of tracking technology

in the face that I had
I presume to others

in the space that it had
to the other end

I had entered my phone
Cereal and others’ health
