('had', 'our')

If he had not carried one virtue
You can hear it also through your leisure

When we had jobs that were to earn
Two hours and

I had me a vision
or an available resource

Since I had to hold the entire company

or alter of course the time anyway

We had inhabited actually
This is your voice 

in the face that I had
Who throws contours away

I had entered my phone
phrase them of our possessions
