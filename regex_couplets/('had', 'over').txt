('had', 'over')

If he had not carried one virtue
hovering above standing water

I had me a vision
over the long time up in the sky

Since I had to hold the entire company
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

The long time I had a vision
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

we had to say goodbye
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

in the face that I had
for not paying sound overwhelmed

in the space that it had
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
