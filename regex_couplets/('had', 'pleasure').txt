('had', 'pleasure')

If he had not carried one virtue
Which is a pleasure to never live out

When we had jobs that were to earn
there was no walking along the pleasure

I had me a vision
up in the television pleasure

The long time I had a vision
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I had a vision
