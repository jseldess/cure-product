('had', 'principle')

If he had not carried one virtue
under the last seen principle

we had to say goodbye
Under the last principle of purchasing power

And we had to say goodbye to her there
under the grasp principle

We had to say goodbye there
under the past principle

We had to buy there
Under the grass principle

I had me a vision
