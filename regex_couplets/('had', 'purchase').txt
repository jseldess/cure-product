('had', 'purchase')

If he had not carried one virtue
in traversing my purchase

The long time I had a vision
purchased out

we had to say goodbye
Having been purchased out of you

And we had to say goodbye to her there
for an ungraspable purchase

We had to say goodbye there
And need out in front purchase

We had to buy there
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I had me a vision
until I purchase up the sky

that nothing had gravity
I have entered my purchases

in the face that I had
for my own purchases

though we are breaking in the space that it had
found dated for my own purchases

in the space that it had
impulse for my own purchases

which had on honor to be told
converting sight into a purchase

I had entered my phone
at the site of a purchase
