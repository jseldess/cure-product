('had', 'purchases')

If he had not carried one virtue
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I had me a vision
Is the weight of my purchases

that nothing had gravity
I have entered my purchases

in the face that I had
for my own purchases

though we are breaking in the space that it had
found dated for my own purchases

in the space that it had
impulse for my own purchases

which had on honor to be told
the impulse for my own purchases

I had entered my phone
