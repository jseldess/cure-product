('had', 'purpose')

If he had not carried one virtue
by no ventillation my purpose

I had me a vision
until I purpose the horizon

I had a vision
of my purpose in versing

we had to say goodbye
My purpose up in the sky

We had to say goodbye there
Until my purpose 

And we had to say goodbye to her there
I tell you my purposes

that nothing had gravity
Where I host my purposes

in the face that I had
the impulse for my own purposes

in the space that it had
the impulse to my purpose

which had on honor to be told
to the other end of my purpose

I had entered my phone
for my own purposes
