('had', 'really')

If he had not carried one virtue
When they really take hold of my finger

I had me a vision
without really agreeing

We had inhabited actually
without really speaking

though we are breaking in the space that it had
without really breaking

which had on honor to be told
without really branding 

in the space that it had
without really binding

in the face that it had
also didnâ€™t really move

I had entered my phone
