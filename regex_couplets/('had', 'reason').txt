('had', 'reason')

If he had not carried one virtue
reasons resources

When we had jobs that were to earn
with little reason to move

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
with little reasons to aspiration

I had to tell them the news
with little reason to aspiration

I had me a vision
Toward the start informally given my reasons

The long time I had a vision
More reasons around my country 

in the face that I had
and could be inflected with reasons
