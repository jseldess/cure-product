('had', 'ring')

If he had not carried one virtue
ring

When we had jobs that were to earn
hovering above standing water

I had me a vision
actually considering the end

The long time I had a vision
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I had a vision
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

we had to say goodbye
storing in surfeit

We had to say goodbye there
firing and connecting somewhere

which had on honor to be told
The prospect for veering healthily
