('had', 'side')

If he had not carried one virtue
aside from the retinas

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
actually considering the end

The long time I had a vision
But my not feeling the memory aside

in the face that I had
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

in the space that it had
where I send and relive aside

which had on honor to be told
by the side of the hosting service

I had entered my phone
