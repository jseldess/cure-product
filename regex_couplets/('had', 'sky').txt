If he had not carried one virtue
Blue sky or

I had me a vision
over the long time up in the sky

Since I had to hold the entire company
though not many facts up in the sky

The long time I had a vision
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

Up in the sky

We had to say goodbye there
My purpose up in the sky

And we had to say goodbye to her there
While theyâ€™re up in the sky

that nothing had gravity
