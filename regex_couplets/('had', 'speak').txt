('had', 'speak')

If he had not carried one virtue
not speaking

though we are breaking in the space that it had
without really speaking

in the space that it had
I speak to them

which had on honor to be told
I speak to them my possessions

I had me a vision
I speak them of my possessions

I had entered my phone
speak them of my possessions
