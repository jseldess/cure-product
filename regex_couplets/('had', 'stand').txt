('had', 'stand')

If he had not carried one virtue
hovering above standing water

I had me a vision
I stand and retrieve the impulse

in the face that I had
where I stand and relive

in the space that it had
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

which had on honor to be told
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

I had entered my phone
my standing in data
