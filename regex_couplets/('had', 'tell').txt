('had', 'tell')

If he had not carried one virtue
So I constellate the time family country

When we had jobs that were to earn
The CEO tells me to embody values

I had me a vision
I had to tell them the news

The long time I had a vision
I tell you my purposes

that nothing had gravity
and that man comes on to tell me 

in the space that it had
