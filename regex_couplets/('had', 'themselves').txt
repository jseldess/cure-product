('had', 'themselves')

If he had not carried one virtue
talking into pheasants bending themselves

The long time I had a vision
talking into percents bending themselves

we had to say goodbye
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

which had on honor to be told
battery dawn nights blending themselves

I had entered my phone
battery dawn nights ending themselves
