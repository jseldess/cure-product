('had', 'through')

If he had not carried one virtue
You can hear it also through your leisure

When we had jobs that were to earn
Back up through the results

I had me a vision
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

The long time I had a vision
I cannot clear it also through investiture

I had a vision
I get through there

we had to say goodbye
