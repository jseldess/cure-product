('had', 'time.')

If he had not carried one virtue
So I constellate the time family country

When we had jobs that were to earn
 and time in the train

I had me a vision
On the timeline I was on

Since I had to hold the entire company
The long time I had a vision

I had a vision
without the long time I was accounting

we had to say goodbye
or alter of course the time anyway

We had inhabited actually
formerly a long time they were on

in the face that I had
until a happier time found

in the space that it had
formerly along time they were on

I had entered my phone
in the long time they were on
