('had', 'tire')

If he had not carried one virtue
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I had me a vision
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

Since I had to hold the entire company
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

I had nightmares though
until I could not tire 

The long time I had a vision
until I could not be tired

I had a vision
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

we had inhabited actually
