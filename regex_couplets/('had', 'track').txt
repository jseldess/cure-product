('had', 'track')

If he had not carried one virtue
I reuse indelible tracks 

The long time I had a vision
The first track

I had a vision
and other types of tracking technology

in the face that I had
which as tracked befitted 

in the space that it had
which as tracked befitted phased

I had entered my phone
sizes track for asking sound
