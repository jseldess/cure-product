('had', 'until')

If he had not carried one virtue
until my purpose up in the sky

I had me a vision
until I could not tire 

The long time I had a vision
until I could not be tired

I had a vision
until I purpose up in the sky

that nothing had gravity
until the bill came

we had inhabited actually
until a happier time found

in the space that it had
