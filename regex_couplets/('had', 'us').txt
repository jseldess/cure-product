('had', 'us')

If he had not carried one virtue
I want to cite a poem so usual

When we had jobs that were to earn
was not just a defeat

I had me a vision
The ventillation rushes on

Since I had to hold the entire company
So stay with us

I had to tell them the news
but it continued rippling muscle

The long time I had a vision
because there was no solid ground to continue along

I had a vision
I have them trust in me

we had to say goodbye
articles all around us

We had to say goodbye there
I wear suspenders

that nothing had gravity
a futile joyous white sun

we had inhabited actually
in the form filled offered in trust

in the space that it had
trackers collecting data on users

in the face that I had
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

which had on honor to be told
useless for not having paid

in the face that it had
about the sight hosting trusting

I had entered my phone
radiating from housing
