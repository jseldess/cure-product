('had', 'use')

If he had not carried one virtue
You use the most essential parts

I had me a vision
I reuse unassimilable visions

The long time I had a vision
because there was no solid ground to continue along

I had a vision
I used my technology

that nothing had gravity
trackers collecting data on users

in the face that I had
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

in the space that it had
useless for not having paid

in the face that it had
