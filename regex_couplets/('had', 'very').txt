('had', 'very')

If he had not carried one virtue
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I had me a vision
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

Since I had to hold the entire company
There was very little physical activity

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
embodied everyday

I had to tell them the news
They have very many choices

in the face that I had
