('had', 'vision')

If he had not carried one virtue
I had me a vision

Since I had to hold the entire company
aspirating with visions

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
embodied with little visions

I had to tell them the news
aspirating with little visions

The long time I had a vision
there wasnâ€™t any television 

I had a vision
I resume attributable visions

we had to say goodbye
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

we had inhabited actually
joined in my television

I had entered my phone
visions that can be attainable
