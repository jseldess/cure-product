('had', 'visions')

If he had not carried one virtue
The planning process for visions

I had me a vision
aspirating visions

Since I had to hold the entire company
aspirating with visions

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
embodied with little visions

I had to tell them the news
aspirating with little visions

The long time I had a vision
I resume unassimilable visions

I had a vision
I resume attributable visions

we had to say goodbye
visions that can be attainable
