('had', 'wait')

If he had not carried one virtue
There are spots waiting

that nothing had gravity
Though we are waiting for her

We had inhabited actually
not needing to wait

which had on honor to be told
Though we are waiting 

in the space that it had
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

I had entered my phone
waiting out front or up above
