('had', 'were')

If he had not carried one virtue
When we had jobs that were to earn

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
my desires were open

I had me a vision
I argued the days were longer

Since I had to hold the entire company
The days were long

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
I argued that the days were longer

I had to tell them the news
The days were long aligned

The long time I had a vision
they were on

we had to say goodbye
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

we had inhabited actually
formerly a long time they were on

in the face that I had
answered about 

which had on honor to be told
by the sight of the hosting answered about

I had entered my phone
I answered about
