('had', 'will')

If he had not carried one virtue
will not be the same

The long time I had a vision
that will spur me on

we had to say goodbye
would only willingly break

which had on honor to be told
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

in the space that it had
my daughter will learn 

I had entered my phone
