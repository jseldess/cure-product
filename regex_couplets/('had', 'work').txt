('had', 'work')

If he had not carried one virtue
nor work in this way daily

I had me a vision
Having transitioned from leisure to work

Since I had to hold the entire company
I need the work

The long time I had a vision
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

I had a vision
nor envy honest work

in the face that I had
