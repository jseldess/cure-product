('had', 'world')

If he had not carried one virtue
The world 

When we had jobs that were to earn
Which can be pronounced to the world

I had me a vision
off the edge of the world

Since I had to hold the entire company
off the end of the world

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
hauling off the end of the world

The long time I had a vision
falling off the end of the world

I had a vision
the opinions in my world

which had on honor to be told
