('had', 'you.')

If he had not carried one virtue
if you have providence to excess

When we had jobs that were to earn
If you have confidence regardless all else

I had me a vision
That you can see only the back of

Since I had to hold the entire company
since you can imagine movement

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
where you can earn more 

The long time I had a vision
You can hear it also through your leisure

I had a vision
a futile joyous white sun

we had to say goodbye
I tell you my purposes

that nothing had gravity
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

we had inhabited actually
This is your voice 

in the face that I had
the young ripples inaudibly
