('has', 'Having')

conversations with our purchase
Having transitioned from leisure to work

in traversing my purchase
Having been purchased out of you

Under the last principle of purchasing power
Having seen more than 

if that has anything
Having seen more than I can remember 

converting sight into a purchase
