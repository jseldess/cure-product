('has', 'That')

conversations with our purchase
That’s exaclty what I want for them

Before anyone has walked across the field
That is itself not still

It has been since
That’s where I sleep at times

in traversing my purchase
That I captured an afterimage

if that has anything
That are my right to say

at the site of a purchase
