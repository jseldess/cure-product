('has', 'Thou')

conversations with our purchase
Though there are quarters goals

It has been since
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

in traversing my purchase
Though in not many acts

purchased out
Though we are waiting for her

if that has anything
Though we are breaking 

For my own purchases
Though we are waiting 

phase decisioned by the prospect
Though we can’t help waiting

He has turned it off
