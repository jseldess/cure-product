('has', 'buy')

conversations with our purchase
Before anyone buys up the opening

Before anyone has walked across the opening
We had to buy there

And need out in front purchase
buy in the surrounded privacy

converting sight into a purchase
buy in the sound privacy

phase decisioned by the prospect
