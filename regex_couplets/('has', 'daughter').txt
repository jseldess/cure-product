('has', 'daughter')

conversations with our purchase
I love my daughter still

in traversing my purchase
with my daughter

phase decisioned by the prospect
my daughter will learn 

converting sight into a purchase
My daughter with her way

He has turned it off
my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me

at the site of a purchase
