('has', 'directly')

conversations with our purchase
if not directly on my skin

Before anyone has walked across the opening
of not directly from my skin

It has been since
But not to me directly

in traversing my purchase
The sun high enough to enter directly 

purchased out
The sun high enough to strike directly
