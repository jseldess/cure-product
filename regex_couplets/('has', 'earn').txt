('has', 'earn')

conversations with our purchase
in light of learning what we see

Before anyone has walked across the opening
When we had jobs that were to earn

in traversing my purchase
where you can earn more 

purchased out
decisioned to learn 

if that has anything
decisioned to learn back

phase decisioned by the prospect
phase decision for learning

phase decision step in
for learning by the prospect

converting sight into a purchase
a precision for learning

for my own purchases
I learned my location

at the site of a purchase
I learned my point

phase decisioned
my daughter will learn
