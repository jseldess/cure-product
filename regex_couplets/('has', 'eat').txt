('has', 'eat')

conversations with our purchase
I reach repeated expressions first

Before anyone has walked across the opening
But I can’t let myself treat 

It has been since
Then I can’t presume to treat others

in traversing my purchase
it was not just a defeat

purchased out
And from that great distance

until I purchase up the sky
And from a great distance

until I purchase the sky
was not just a defeat

I have entered my purchases
for the creation of the universe

if that has anything
burrowed about from repeated travels

at the site of a purchase
