('has', 'he')

conversations with our purchase
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Before anyone has walked across the opening
I can find a way to block it in the incoming stream

Before anyone has walked across the field
from the incoming stream

It has been since
here described

in traversing my purchase
talking into pheasants bending themselves

purchased out
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

having been purchased out
Under the grasp principle

having been purchased out of you
Under the grass principle

Under the last principle of purchasing power
And we had to say goodbye to her there

for an ungraspable purchase
My purpose up in the sky

And need out in front purchase
Under the last principle

I tell you the weight of my purchases
until I purpose up in the sky

my purchase up in the sky
until my purpose up in the sky

until I purchase up in the sky
While theyâ€™re up in the sky

until I purchase up the sky
around the dogs and lillies

until I purchase the sky
all the spots

until my purchase up in the sky
my purchse up in the sky

Is the weight of my purchases
Is the weight of my click or zipcode

if that has anything
I have a memory between the day

I have entered my purchases
Then I saw into you

the impulse for my own purchases
where I stand aside

washed my purchases
elsewhere my purposes

for my own purchases
all parties would be helped

found dated for my own purchases
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

sound inundated for my own purchases
All parties would be held for my own purchases

impulse for my own purchases
where I end

phase decisioned by the prospect
by in the sound privacy

phase decisioned
by in the sounded privacy

phase decision for learning
for learning by the prospect

converting sight into a purchase
the way was water

He has turned it off
But my not feeling the memory inside

which as tracked befitted phased
step by into the prospect

at the site of a purchase
as the right of a surcharge

I ask say in that phase decisioned
stopping into the prospect
