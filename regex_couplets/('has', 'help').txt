('has', 'help')

conversations with our purchase
people would be helped

washed my purchases
The constituents would be helped

for my own purchases
all parties would be helped

found dated for my own purchases
in the form help sale offered

phase decisioned by the prospect
Bach helps turn it off

He has turned it off
