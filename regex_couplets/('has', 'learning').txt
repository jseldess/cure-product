('has', 'learning')

conversations with our purchase
in light of learning what we see

Before anyone has walked across the opening
I spend time online learning to code

in traversing my purchase
phase decision for learning

phase decision step in
for learning by the prospect

converting sight into a purchase
a precision for learning

for my own purchases
