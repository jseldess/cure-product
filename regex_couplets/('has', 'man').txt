('has', 'man')

conversations with our purchase
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

It has been since
not many face up

in traversing my purchase
though not many facts up in the sky

purchased out
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

if that has anything
They have very many choices

washed my purchases
and that man comes on to tell me 

phase decisioned by the prospect
The many transparent pixel calls

phase decisioned
