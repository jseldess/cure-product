('has', 'so')

conversations with our purchase
When I want something

Before anyone has walked across the opening
You can hear it also through your leisure

It has been since
soft paper

in traversing my purchase
If I take some different measure

purchased out
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

until I purchase up the sky
so that nothing had gravity

if that has anything
I want to cite a poem so usual

I have entered my purchases
sound inundated for my own purchases

All parties would be held for my own purchases
and sound redundant

for my own purchases
firing and connecting somewhere

phase decisioned by the prospect
by in the sound privacy

phase decisioned
by in the sounded privacy

phase decision for learning
sizes track for asking sound

converting sight into a purchase
sizes asking for tracking sound

impulse for my own purchases
also didnâ€™t really move

at the site of a purchase
buy in the sound privacy

which as tracked befitted phased
bought in the sounded privacy
