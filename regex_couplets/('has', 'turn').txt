('has', 'turn')

conversations with our purchase
in a sharp downward turn 

It has been since
sudden downward turn

in traversing my purchase
who knows how to turn it off

He has turned it off
I have turned it off

phase decisioned by the prospect
I turn not sad exactly

at the site of a purchase
I returned to location

phase decisioned
