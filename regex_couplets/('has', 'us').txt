('has', 'us')

conversations with our purchase
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Before anyone has walked across the opening
Theyâ€™re just not mine

It has been since
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

in traversing my purchase
I reuse unassimilable visions

purchased out
Articles all around us

Having been purchased out of you
I wear suspenders

until I purchase up the sky
suspenders

until I purchase the sky
a futile joyous white sun

if that has anything
I want to cite a poem so usual

I have entered my purchases
trackers collecting data on users

washed my purchases
in the form filled offered in trust

For my own purchases
useless for not having paid

phase decisioned by the prospect
radiating from housing

at the site of a purchase
I have them trust in me

phase decisioned
