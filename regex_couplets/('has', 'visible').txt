('has', 'visible')

conversations with our purchase
Iâ€™ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

It has been since
And make myself a visible

in traversing my purchase
I assume the offers divisible

phase decisioned by the prospect
that they were divisible

converting sight into a purchase
I assumed that they were divisible
