('has', 'wait')

conversations with our purchase
There are spots waiting

until I purchase up in the sky
Though we are waiting for her

if that has anything
not needing to wait

phase decisioned by the prospect
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

He has turned it off
waiting out front or up above 

at the site of a purchase
