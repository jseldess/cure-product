('has', 'you.')

conversations with our purchase
Though how can you know without direction

It has been since
You can hear it also through your leisure

in traversing my purchase
where you can earn more 

purchased out
I tell you my purposes

I tell you the weight of my purchases
I tell you the weight of my purposes

Is the weight of my purchases
I tell you where I need gravity

if that has anything
This is your voice 

I have entered my purchases
This is your chance

the impulse for my own purchases
the young ripples inaudibly

phase decisioned by the prospect
