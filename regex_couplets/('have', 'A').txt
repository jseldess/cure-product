('have', 'A')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Arrayed out in such a nested way

I have entered my phone
All of the time

as long as I have access to the code
Actually one day there is direction

if you have providence to excess
BREAK

If you have confidence regardless all else
Attributable or

May I have your zip code
A turtle fished out of the lake

I have them lost
COPY DREAM 

I have supporters
And reached up the screen

I have a memory between the day
And we could inhabit the room easy

I have entered my purposes
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

They have very many choices
A baby and a bear

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
CONTRACT

I have turned it off
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

and have no way
Aligned or not with my interests

I have them trust in me
3 [PASSWORDS]

I have seen more than I can remember
