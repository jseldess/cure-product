('have', 'As')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Ask who I am to suspend

I have entered my phone
As though stationary and a destination

if you have providence to excess
Assimilable or

May I have your zip code
Aspirational strategy

If you have confidence regardless all else
As a clone, illegally conceived

I have supporters
