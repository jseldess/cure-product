('have', 'For')

We’ll have coffee this morning
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

if you have providence to excess
Forecasting the story before dawn

If you have confidence regardless all else
For an ungraspable time

I have supporters
For Mitt Romney

I have entered my purposes
For my own purchases

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Formerly a way like this one

I have turned it off
Formerly away there are constant ways

and have no way
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

I have entered my phone
For a while I think I don’t listen

I have seen more than I can remember
