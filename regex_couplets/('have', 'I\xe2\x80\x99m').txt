('have', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

We’ll have coffee this morning
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

I have entered my phone
I’m simply inside

if you have providence to excess
Right now I’m the cart

If you have confidence regardless all else
where I’m watching my tv

I have them lost
