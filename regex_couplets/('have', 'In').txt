('have', 'IN')

We’ll have coffee this morning
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

if you have providence to excess
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

If you have confidence regardless all else
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

I have supporters
By NATASHA SINGER

I have entered my phone
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

I have turned it off
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

and have no way
