('have', 'It')

We’ll have coffee this morning
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

I have entered my phone
It keeps coming down thankfully

before we can have a retroactive
It has been since

if you have providence to excess
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

If you have confidence regardless all else
It’s not marshal exactly

I have turned it off
It’s not marshall exactly

and have no way
