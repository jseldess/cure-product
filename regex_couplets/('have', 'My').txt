('have', 'My')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
My live connections to you

I have entered my phone
My associations

If you have confidence regardless all else
My purpose up in the sky

I have supporters
My means without gravity

I have a memory between the day
My daughter with her way

I have turned it off
My say to the elections

I have them lost
My state kept loaned impression

I have them trust in me
