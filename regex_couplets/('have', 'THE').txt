('have', 'THE')

We’ll have coffee this morning
THE SNOW

if you have providence to excess
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

If you have confidence regardless all else
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

I have them lost
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

I have supporters
THE OFFERS

I have seen more than I can remember
