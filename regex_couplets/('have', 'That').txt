('have', 'That')

We’ll have coffee this morning
That’s exaclty what I want for them

as long as I have access to the code
That is itself not still

if you have providence to excess
That’s when they really take

If you have confidence regardless all else
That I captured an afterimage

I have a memory between the day
That are my right to say

I have them lost
