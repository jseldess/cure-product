('have', 'There')

We’ll have coffee this morning
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

as long as I have access to the code
There are quarterly goals

if you have providence to excess
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

If you have confidence regardless all else
There was very little physical activity

I have them lost
There are spots waiting

I have a memory between the day
There are constant ways

and have no way
