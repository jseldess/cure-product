('have', 'Thou')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Though there are quarters goals

if you have providence to excess
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

If you have confidence regardless all else
Though we are waiting for her

I have a memory between the day
Though we are breaking 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Though we can’t help waiting

I have turned it off
