('have', 'though')

We’ll have coffee this morning
As though stationary and a destination

if you have providence to excess
though it was most emphatically that

If you have confidence regardless all else
I had nightmares though

I have them lost
I thought

I have a memory between the day
though we are still breaking in

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
after though there’s no memory

I have turned it off
I answered what I thought

I have entered my phone
I answered what I thought about

I have them trust in me
