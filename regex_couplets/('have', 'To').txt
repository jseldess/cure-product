('have', 'To')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
To my children Walt Whitman

if you have providence to excess
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

If you have confidence regardless all else
To neither study

May I have your zip code
To that impossible place

I have them lost
To substitute neither study

I have entered my purposes
To the ends of transactions

I have turned it off
To the ends of my transactions

and have no way
To the other end of transactions like this

I have entered my phone
To the right of determined elections

I have them trust in me
