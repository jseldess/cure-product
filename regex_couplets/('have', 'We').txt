('have', 'We')

We’ll have coffee this morning
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

I have entered my phone
We can wrestle them with their goals

if you have providence to excess
We had to say goodbye there

I have supporters
We had inhabited actually

I have a memory between the day
We got paid one way by a voice

If you have confidence regardless all else
We ask say in that case

I have seen more than I can remember
