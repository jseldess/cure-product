('have', 'Where')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Where I sleep at times

I have entered my phone
Where official policy is to catch and release

If you have confidence regardless all else
Where I lead gravity

I have supporters
Where I need gravity

I have a memory between the day
Where in me did I host

I have entered my purposes
Where I host my purposes

I have entered my purchases
Where in me did I last

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Where in me did I lose

I have turned it off
