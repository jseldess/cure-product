('have', 'Which')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Which is a measure to never live out

if you have providence to excess
Which is a pleasure to never live out

If you have confidence regardless all else
Which can be called confidence

May I have your zip code
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

I have entered my phone
