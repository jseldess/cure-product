('have', 'while')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Looking back while I should be sleeping

If you have confidence regardless all else
while wrapped in explicit static

I have them lost
while consuming damage

I have supporters
I answered while interfaced

I have them trust in me
for a while to listen already

I have seen more than I can remember
