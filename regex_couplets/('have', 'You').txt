('have', 'You')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
You should ask who I am

I have entered my phone
You can hear it also through your leisure

if you have providence to excess
You use the most essential parts

If you have confidence regardless all else
You need history

I have them lost
You can have seen offering

Or can have seen offering possession
