('have', 'about')

We’ll have coffee this morning
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

I have entered my phone
about my children’s consumption

before we can have a retroactive
burrowed about from repeated travels

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
answered about 

I have turned it off
I answered about

I have them lost
