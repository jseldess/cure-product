('have', 'across')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Before we walk across the wide field

I have entered my phone
Before we walk across the wide opening

before we can have a retroactive
Before anyone walks across the opening

as long as I have access to the code
across the retinas

If you have confidence regardless all else
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

I have entered my purposes
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

Or can have seen offering possession
