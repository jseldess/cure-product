('have', 'act')

We’ll have coffee this morning
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

I have entered my phone
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light

before we can have a retroactive
One day was actually

if you have providence to excess
I was enjoined to act again

If you have confidence regardless all else
we had inhabited actually

I have a memory between the day
to the ends of my transactions

I have entered my purposes
The ends of my transactions

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

I have turned it off
It’s not marshal exactly

and have no way
of my actions

I have them lost
before I act on them

I have seen more than I can remember
