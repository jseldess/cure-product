('have', 'agreed')

We’ll have coffee this morning
and to which I’ve agreed

I have a memory between the day
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
that agreed one of rest

I have turned it off
that agreed home

I have seen more than I can remember
