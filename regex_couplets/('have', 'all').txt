('have', 'All')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
All of the time

as long as I have access to the code
All that I can think I want

If you have confidence regardless all else
All parties would be held for my own purchases

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
All that I own messageable

I have seen more than I can remember
