('have', 'along')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
bring your child along

if you have providence to excess
The days lined along company

If you have confidence regardless all else
formerly along time they were on

I have turned it off
formerly along my say to the elections

I have entered my phone
along cables

I have them lost
