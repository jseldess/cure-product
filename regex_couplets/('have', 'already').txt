('have', 'already')

We’ll have coffee this morning
So I presume the offers already

I have entered my phone
already formerly a long time

I have a memory between the day
dawn already formerly nights 

If you have confidence regardless all else
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
already brought into privacy

I have seen more than I can remember
