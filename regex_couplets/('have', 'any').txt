('have', 'any')

We’ll have coffee this morning
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

I have entered my phone
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

before we can have a retroactive
Before anyone buys up the opening

as long as I have access to the code
at any time it can drift again

if you have providence to excess
Or the company

If you have confidence regardless all else
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I have supporters
there wasn’t any television 

I have a memory between the day
Or alter of course the time anyway

I have entered my purposes
They have very many choices

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
latency which doesn’t mean anything

I have turned it off
The many transparent pixel calls

and have no way
or imagined anyway

I have them lost
