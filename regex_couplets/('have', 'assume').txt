('have', 'assume')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I assumed it was visible

I have entered my phone
I assumed 

I have a memory between the day
I assumed what I draw

I have them lost
I assume the offers reliable

I have seen more than I can remember
I assumed that they were divisible

Or can have seen offering possession
I assume possession to others

can have seen offering possession
