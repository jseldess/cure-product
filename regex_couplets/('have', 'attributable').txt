('have', 'attributable')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I resume attributable visions

If you have confidence regardless all else
attributable visions

I have supporters
that decisions can be attributable

I have turned it off
decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
in that decisions can be attributable

Or can have seen offering possession
