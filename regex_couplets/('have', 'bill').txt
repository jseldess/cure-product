('have', 'bill')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
between bills and stuffed animals

I have entered my phone
I hear it between bills and stuff

If you have confidence regardless all else
billowing in the cloud

I have them lost
until the bill came

I have a memory between the day
the bill my detuning 

I have them trust in me
bills and stuffed animals

I have seen more than I can remember
