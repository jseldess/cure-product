('have', 'blend')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
battery dawn nights blending themselves

before we can have a retroactive
walking into percents blending themselves

I have them lost
where I blend and relive

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
where lights blended themselves

I have entered my phone
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

I have them trust in me
