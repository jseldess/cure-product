('have', 'but')

We’ll have coffee this morning
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

I have entered my phone
but not impart cynicism

if you have providence to excess
Attributable or

May I have your zip code
but the sun isn’t up

If you have confidence regardless all else
I resume attributable visions

I have them lost
attributable visions

I have supporters
that decisions can be attributable

I have turned it off
but for memory elsewhere

I have them trust in me
decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
in that decisions can be attributable

Or can have seen offering possession
