('have', 'call')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
not calling or echoing for once

I have entered my phone
though it was most emphatically that

if you have providence to excess
Which can be called confidence

May I have your zip code
They are called aspirational

If you have confidence regardless all else
to take the call

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
The many transparent pixel calls

and have no way
recalling aside

I have them lost
