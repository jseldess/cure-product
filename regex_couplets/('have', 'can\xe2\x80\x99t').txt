('have', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

We’ll have coffee this morning
I can’t fix them without direction

if you have providence to excess
That can’t be glimpsed

If you have confidence regardless all else
Though we can’t help waiting

I have turned it off
I can’t remember them

I have them lost
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

Or can have seen offering possession
