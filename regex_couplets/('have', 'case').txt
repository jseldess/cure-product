('have', 'case')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

I have entered my phone
only in the case

May I have your zip code
I ask say in that case

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
we ask say in that case

I have turned it off
