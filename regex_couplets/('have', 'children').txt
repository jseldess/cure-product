('have', 'children')

We’ll have coffee this morning
On a snow day with my children

I have entered my phone
about my children’s consumption

before we can have a retroactive
only fragments of time with my children

if you have providence to excess
Even the children

I have supporters
my possession of my children

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
speech my possession of my children

I have turned it off
