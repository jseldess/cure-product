('have', 'come')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

I have entered my phone
Strategy comes before morning

If you have confidence regardless all else
and that man comes on to tell me 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
and come home to remind inflections

Or can have seen offering possession
