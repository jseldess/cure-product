('have', 'could')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
and could be mapped and weighed

If you have confidence regardless all else
until I could not be tired

I have them lost
I could consume the dream

I have supporters
I could in effect credit

I have a memory between the day
And we could inhabit the room easy

I have entered my purposes
and could be inflected with reasons

I have seen more than I can remember
