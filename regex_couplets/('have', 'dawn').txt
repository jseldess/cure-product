('have', 'dawn')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
battery dawn nights blending themselves

before we can have a retroactive
Forecasting the story before dawn

If you have confidence regardless all else
dawn already formerly nights 

I have a memory between the day
dawn formerly

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
battery dawn nights 

and have no way
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

I have entered my phone
battery dawn nights ending themselves

I have them lost
