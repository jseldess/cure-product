('have', 'day')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
On a snow day with my children

I have entered my phone
One day there is direction

as long as I have access to the code
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

if you have providence to excess
I argued the days felt longer

If you have confidence regardless all else
The day

I have a memory between the day
at least most days

I have them lost
