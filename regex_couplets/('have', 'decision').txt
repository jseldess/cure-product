('have', 'decision')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
the planning process for decisions

If you have confidence regardless all else
attributable decisions

I have supporters
forgetting decisions 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
decisioned to learn 

I have turned it off
decisioned to learn back

I have entered my phone
decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
that decisions can be attributable

Or can have seen offering possession
