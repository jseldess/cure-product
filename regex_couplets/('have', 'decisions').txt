('have', 'decisions')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
the planning process for decisions

If you have confidence regardless all else
attributable decisions

I have supporters
forgetting decisions 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
that decisions can be attributable

I have turned it off
decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
in that decisions can be attributable

Or can have seen offering possession
