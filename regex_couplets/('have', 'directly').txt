('have', 'directly')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
if not directly on my skin

as long as I have access to the code
But not to me directly

If you have confidence regardless all else
The sun high enough to enter directly

I have entered my purposes
The sun high enough to strike directly

Or can have seen offering possession
