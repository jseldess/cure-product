('have', 'do')

We’ll have coffee this morning
The dogs and lillies

I have entered my phone
In a sharp downard turn

before we can have a retroactive
does not feel an exception

if you have providence to excess
I brought my head down

If you have confidence regardless all else
What I do in my liesure

I have them lost
here is the site of the battle of maldon

I have supporters
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I have a memory between the day
and it doesn’t take long

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
latency which doesn’t mean anything

I have turned it off
I only think I don’t listen

I have seen more than I can remember
