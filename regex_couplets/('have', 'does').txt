('have', 'does')

We’ll have coffee this morning
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

I have entered my phone
does not feel an exception

if you have providence to excess
and it doesn’t take long

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
latency which doesn’t mean anything

I have turned it off
