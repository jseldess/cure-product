('have', 'down')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
in a sharp downward turn 

I have entered my phone
In a sharp downard turn

before we can have a retroactive
to the down arrow

if you have providence to excess
I brought my head down

If you have confidence regardless all else
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

I have a memory between the day
