('have', 'eat')

We’ll have coffee this morning
too sunny to eat ice cream

I have entered my phone
I reach repeated expressions first

before we can have a retroactive
I propogated repeated expressions first

as long as I have access to the code
But I can’t let myself treat 

if you have providence to excess
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

If you have confidence regardless all else
was not just a defeat

May I have your zip code
Where I put it beating

I have them lost
And from that great distance

I have supporters
And from a great distance

I have a memory between the day
for the creation of the universe

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
burrowed about from repeated travels

I have them trust in me
