('have', 'edge')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I step off the edge

I have entered my phone
Face falling off the edge of the face

before we can have a retroactive
The edge is put in place

if you have providence to excess
off the edge of the world

If you have confidence regardless all else
Falling off the edge of the face

I have them lost
