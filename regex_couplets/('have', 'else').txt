('have', 'else')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
If you have confidence regardless all else

May I have your zip code
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I have supporters
and elsewhere my memory

I have entered my purposes
and elsewhere my memory of you

I have entered my purchases
elsewhere my purposes

I have entered my phone
elsewhere by my memory

I have turned it off
By my memory elsewhere

I have them lost
