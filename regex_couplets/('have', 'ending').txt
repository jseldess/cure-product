('have', 'ending')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
battery dawn nights blending themselves

before we can have a retroactive
I tried to feel the key values extending 

If you have confidence regardless all else
talking into percents bending themselves

I have them lost
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
battery dawn nights ending themselves

I have them trust in me
