('have', 'enter')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I have entered my phone

before we can have a retroactive
The sun high enough to enter directly 

If you have confidence regardless all else
I enter the flattening mirror

I have them lost
I have entered my purposes

I have entered my purchases
entered into my purposes

They have very many choices
I had entered my phone

I have them trust in me
