('have', 'feel')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
conversations with our feelings

before we can have a retroactive
conversation with our feelings

as long as I have access to the code
does not feel an exception

if you have providence to excess
I tried to feel the key values extending 

If you have confidence regardless all else
But my not feeling the memory aside

I have entered my purposes
But my not feeling the memory inside

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
which feels more comfortable

I have entered my phone
which I feel formerly about for

I have turned it off
By my feeling the memory inside

and have no way
But my feeling the memory aside

I have them lost
