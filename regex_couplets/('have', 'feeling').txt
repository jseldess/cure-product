('have', 'feeling')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
conversations with our feelings

before we can have a retroactive
conversation with our feelings

as long as I have access to the code
But my not feeling the memory aside

I have entered my purposes
But my not feeling the memory inside

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
By my feeling the memory inside

and have no way
But my feeling the memory aside

I have them lost
