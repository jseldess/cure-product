('have', 'field')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Before we walk across the wide field

I have entered my phone
stopped light with validated variegated fields

before we can have a retroactive
Before anyone has walked across the field

as long as I have access to the code
stopped light with validated fields

I have turned it off
