('have', 'form')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
There are performance reviews

if you have providence to excess
Toward the start informally given my reasons

If you have confidence regardless all else
already formerly a long time

I have a memory between the day
in the form filled offered in trust

I have entered my purposes
A way formerly like this one

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
in the form filled offered trust

I have entered my phone
which I feel formerly about for

I have turned it off
formerly a way

and have no way
formerly away

I have them lost
own best form

I have seen more than I can remember
