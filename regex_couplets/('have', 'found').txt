('have', 'found')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

They have very many choices
found dated for my own purchases

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
So I found myself at home

I have seen more than I can remember
