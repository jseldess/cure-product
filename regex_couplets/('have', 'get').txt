('have', 'get')

We’ll have coffee this morning
I’ll get there eventually

I have entered my phone
and is relentlessly budgeted

if you have providence to excess
I’ll get there ruins

If you have confidence regardless all else
I get through there

I have them lost
I get from here through there

I have supporters
forgetting decisions 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
forgettable

I have seen more than I can remember
and maybe forgettable

Or can have seen offering possession
