('have', 'going')

We’ll have coffee this morning
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

I have entered my phone
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

If you have confidence regardless all else
The way that she is going

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
The way that I am going

I have turned it off
the way that I was going

and have no way
way I was going 

I have them lost
