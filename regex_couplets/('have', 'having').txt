('have', 'Having')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Having transitioned from leisure to work

If you have confidence regardless all else
Having been purchased out of you

I have supporters
Having seen more than 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Having seen more than I can remember 

I have seen more than I can remember
