('have', 'he')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Where I sleep at times

I have entered my phone
Before we walk across the wide opening

before we can have a retroactive
Before anyone buys up the opening

as long as I have access to the code
or the incoming stream

if you have providence to excess
The world 

If you have confidence regardless all else
only in the case

May I have your zip code
Then I cannot see face value

I have them lost
I have them trust in me

I have supporters
While they’re up in the sky

I have a memory between the day
And we could inhabit the room easy

I have entered my purposes
and elsewhere my memory of you

I have entered my purchases
Then I saw into you

if you have providence
I send and retrieve the impulse

They have very many choices
The trackers on users

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

I have turned it off
the way that I was going

and have no way
to the other end

I have seen more than I can remember
I presume to others

Or can have seen offering possession
The sun high enough to strike directly

can have seen offering possession
I assume possession to others

You can have seen offering
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
