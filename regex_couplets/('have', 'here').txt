('have', 'here')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Where I sleep at times

I have entered my phone
Of course there is a direction

before we can have a retroactive
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

as long as I have access to the code
One day there is direction

if you have providence to excess
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

If you have confidence regardless all else
I’ll get there eventually

I have them lost
I get through there

I have supporters
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I have a memory between the day
Where in me did I host

I have entered my purposes
and elsewhere my memory of you

I have entered my purchases
where I send and relive aside

They have very many choices
elsewhere my purposes

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Elsewhere by my memory

I have turned it off
There are constant ways

and have no way
Formerly away there are constant ways

I have them trust in me
I learned the point where I am

I have seen more than I can remember
