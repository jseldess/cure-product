('have', 'high')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
way high up in the inter

if you have providence to excess
higher up in the results

If you have confidence regardless all else
The sun high enough to enter directly

I have entered my purposes
The sun high enough to strike directly

Or can have seen offering possession
