('have', 'hold')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I take hold of my finger

if you have providence to excess
When they really take hold of my finger

If you have confidence regardless all else
and hold and wish to hold

I have them lost
designed to hold up my underwear

I have supporters
I designed them to hold up my underwear

I have a memory between the day
