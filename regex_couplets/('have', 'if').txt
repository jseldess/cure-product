('have', 'if')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
drifting away

I have entered my phone
if not directly on my skin

as long as I have access to the code
drifting does not feel an exception

if you have providence to excess
if he had not carried one virtue 

May I have your zip code
out of the fifth page ruins

If you have confidence regardless all else
If I take a different measure

I have them lost
If I take some different measure

I have supporters
if there is anything 

I have a memory between the day
if you have providence

I have entered my purposes
if that has anything

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
if only on the way to the trash

I have seen more than I can remember
