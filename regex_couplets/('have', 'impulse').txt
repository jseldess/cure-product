('have', 'impulse')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
impulse control

If you have confidence regardless all else
I send and retrieve the impulse

I have entered my purposes
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

I have entered my phone
I stand and retrieve the impulse

I have them lost
