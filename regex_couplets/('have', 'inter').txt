('have', 'inter')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

I have entered my phone
interjecting on a day ambition

as long as I have access to the code
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

if you have providence to excess
hold at intervals riding forward

If you have confidence regardless all else
Then I saw them interview

if you have providence
my interfaced stand data

I have them lost
