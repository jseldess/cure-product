('have', 'joy')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

I have entered my phone
I was enjoying acting against myself

If you have confidence regardless all else
a futile joyous white sun

I have supporters
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

I have a memory between the day
