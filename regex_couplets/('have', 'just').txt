('have', 'just')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

as long as I have access to the code
They’re just not mine

if you have providence to excess
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

If you have confidence regardless all else
was not just a defeat

May I have your zip code
I just got a letter

I have them lost
