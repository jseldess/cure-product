('have', 'know')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
who knows the way

before we can have a retroactive
how can I know without direction

if you have providence to excess
I even know what I would find

If you have confidence regardless all else
even when close to my knowing

I have supporters
knowing the constituents

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
who knows how to turn it off

I have turned it off
who know the ways to their other end

and have no way
that their knowing

I have them lost
