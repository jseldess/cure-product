('have', 'learn')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
in light of learning what we see

before we can have a retroactive
I spend time online learning to code

If you have confidence regardless all else
decisioned to learn 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
decisioned to learn back

I have turned it off
phase decision for learning

I have entered my phone
I learned my location

I have them lost
I learned my point

I have them trust in me
for learning by the prospect

I have seen more than I can remember
