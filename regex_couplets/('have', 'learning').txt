('have', 'learning')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
in light of learning what we see

before we can have a retroactive
I spend time online learning to code

If you have confidence regardless all else
phase decision for learning

I have turned it off
for learning by the prospect

I have entered my phone
a precision for learning

I have seen more than I can remember
