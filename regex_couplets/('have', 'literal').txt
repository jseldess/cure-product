('have', 'literal')

We’ll have coffee this morning
and literally moved

I have a memory between the day
as it was designed literally

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
literally moved

I have entered my phone
not literally moved about

I have turned it off
not literally moved

I have them lost
