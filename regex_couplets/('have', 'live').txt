('have', 'live')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I suspend live connections to you

I have entered my phone
Which is a measure to never live out

if you have providence to excess
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

If you have confidence regardless all else
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I have them lost
where I send and relive aside

I have entered my purposes
where I send and relive would be held

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
where I send and relive

I have them trust in me
