('have', 'man')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

I have entered my phone
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

if you have providence to excess
not many face up

If you have confidence regardless all else
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

I have a memory between the day
They have very many choices

I have entered my purposes
and that man comes on to tell me 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
The many transparent pixel calls

and have no way
