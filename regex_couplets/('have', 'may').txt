('have', 'may')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
may not be ingrained

If you have confidence regardless all else
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

I have entered my phone
and maybe regrettable 

I have seen more than I can remember
and maybe forgettable

Or can have seen offering possession
