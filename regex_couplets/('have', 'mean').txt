('have', 'mean')

We’ll have coffee this morning
What does it mean to drift

if you have providence to excess
My means without gravity

I have a memory between the day
latency which doesn’t mean anything

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
The other end of means

and have no way
To the other end of means like this one

I have entered my phone
