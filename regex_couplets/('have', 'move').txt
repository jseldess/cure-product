('have', 'move')

We’ll have coffee this morning
since I can imagine movement

If you have confidence regardless all else
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

I have supporters
and literally moved

I have a memory between the day
myself moved literally as it is

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
literally moved

I have entered my phone
not literally moved about

I have turned it off
also didn’t really move

I have them lost
