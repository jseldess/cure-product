('have', 'moved')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
and literally moved

I have a memory between the day
myself moved literally as it is

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
literally moved

I have entered my phone
not literally moved about

I have turned it off
not literally moved

I have them lost
