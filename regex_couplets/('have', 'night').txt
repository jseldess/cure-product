('have', 'night')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I have entered my phone
battery dawn nights blending themselves

before we can have a retroactive
blue and sun again a second, then night

If you have confidence regardless all else
dawn already formerly nights 

I have a memory between the day
last night

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
battery dawn nights 

and have no way
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

I have them lost
