('have', 'no')

We’ll have coffee this morning
into the minority proportion of time

I have entered my phone
who knows the way

before we can have a retroactive
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

as long as I have access to the code
on a snow day with my children

if you have providence to excess
which can be pronounced 

If you have confidence regardless all else
if he had not carried one virtue 

May I have your zip code
Then I cannot see face value

I have them lost
even when close to my knowing

I have supporters
I used my technology

I have a memory between the day
The sun high enough to enter directly

I have entered my purposes
which we can pronounce

I have entered my purchases
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

They have very many choices
not speaking

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
not literally moved about

I have turned it off
It’s not marshal exactly

and have no way
But my not feeling the memory inside

I have them trust in me
that their knowing

I have seen more than I can remember
The sun high enough to strike directly

Or can have seen offering possession
in that I cannot remember 

can have seen offering possession
