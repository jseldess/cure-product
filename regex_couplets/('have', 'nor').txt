('have', 'nor')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
into the minority proportion of time

I have entered my phone
over the long line I would honor

if you have providence to excess
nor work in this way daily

May I have your zip code
the simple act of honoring an accountant

If you have confidence regardless all else
nor envy honest work

I have entered my purposes
which had on honor to be told

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

I have them lost
