('have', 'offer')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
So I presume the offers already

I have entered my phone
in the form filled offered in trust

I have a memory between the day
in the form filled offered trust

I have turned it off
in track as offer asked 

I have them lost
I assume the offers reliable

I have seen more than I can remember
Or can have seen offering possession

can have seen offering possession
You can have seen offering
