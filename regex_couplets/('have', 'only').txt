('have', 'only')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
only fragments of time with my children

if you have providence to excess
only in the case

May I have your zip code
So that I notice I am the only one

If you have confidence regardless all else
would only willingly break

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
if only on the way to the trash

I have seen more than I can remember
