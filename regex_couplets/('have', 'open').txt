('have', 'open')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Before we walk across the wide opening

I have entered my phone
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

before we can have a retroactive
Before anyone buys up the opening

as long as I have access to the code
my desires were open

If you have confidence regardless all else
