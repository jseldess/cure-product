('have', 'opening')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Before we walk across the wide opening

I have entered my phone
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

before we can have a retroactive
Before anyone buys up the opening

as long as I have access to the code
The simple act opening surmounted

If you have confidence regardless all else
