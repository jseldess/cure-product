('have', 'other')

We’ll have coffee this morning
I’ll pull myself another personality type

I have entered my phone
others desires

if you have providence to excess
On the other hand

If you have confidence regardless all else
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

I have supporters
and other types of tracking technology

I have entered my purposes
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

They have very many choices
I presume to others

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
to the other end

I have turned it off
the other end transactions

and have no way
the other end of actions

I have them lost
I assume possession to others

Or can have seen offering possession
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
