('have', 'others')

We’ll have coffee this morning
others desires

if you have providence to excess
I presume to others

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Cereal and others’ health

I have them lost
I assume possession to others

Or can have seen offering possession
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
