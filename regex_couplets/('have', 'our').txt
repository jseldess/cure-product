('have', 'our')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
reasons resources

I have entered my phone
conversations with our purchase

before we can have a retroactive
conversation with our feelings

as long as I have access to the code
You can hear it also through your leisure

if you have providence to excess
Two hours and

May I have your zip code
I would like your zip code

If you have confidence regardless all else
or alter of course the time anyway

I have a memory between the day
This is your voice 

I have entered my purposes
This is your chance

if you have providence
Who throws contours away

and have no way
phrase them of our possessions

I have seen more than I can remember
