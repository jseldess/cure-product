('have', 'over')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I step over the edge

if you have providence to excess
hovering above standing water

If you have confidence regardless all else
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

I have supporters
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

I have entered my purposes
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

They have very many choices
for not paying sound overwhelmed

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

Or can have seen offering possession
