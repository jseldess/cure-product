('have', 'possession')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I speak to them my possessions

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
my possession of my children

I have turned it off
I speak them of my possessions

I have entered my phone
I stay the right of my possessions 

I have them lost
possessions people

I have them trust in me
phrase them of our possessions

I have seen more than I can remember
Or can have seen offering possession

can have seen offering possession
I assume possession to others

You can have seen offering
