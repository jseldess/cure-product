('have', 'presume')

We’ll have coffee this morning
So I presume the offers already

I have entered my phone
and can’t presume to need

if you have providence to excess
I continue to presume

I have supporters
I presume to others

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
I presume the offers

I have seen more than I can remember
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

Or can have seen offering possession
