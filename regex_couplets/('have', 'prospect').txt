('have', 'prospect')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
The prospects there already

I have entered my phone
the impulse for my own prospects

I have entered my purposes
the impulse my own prospects

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
stopping into the prospect

I have turned it off
speech that is of by prospects

I have them lost
decisioned by the prospect

I have seen more than I can remember
