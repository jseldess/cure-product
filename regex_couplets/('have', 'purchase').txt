('have', 'purchase')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
conversations with our purchase

before we can have a retroactive
in traversing my purchase

If you have confidence regardless all else
purchased out

I have supporters
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I have a memory between the day
I have entered my purchases

if you have providence
the impulse for my own purchases

I have entered my purposes
washed my purchases

I have entered my phone
for my own purchases

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
converting sight into a purchase

I have turned it off
impulse for my own purchases

I have them lost
at the site of a purchase

I have them trust in me
