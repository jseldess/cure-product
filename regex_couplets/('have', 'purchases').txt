('have', 'purchases')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I have supporters
Is the weight of my purchases

I have a memory between the day
I have entered my purchases

if you have providence
the impulse for my own purchases

I have entered my purposes
washed my purchases

I have entered my phone
for my own purchases

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
impulse for my own purchases

I have them lost
