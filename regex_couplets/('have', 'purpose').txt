('have', 'purpose')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
by no ventillation my purpose

if you have providence to excess
until my purpose up in the sky

If you have confidence regardless all else
until I purpose the horizon

I have them lost
in conversing of my purpose

I have supporters
until I purpose up in the sky

I have a memory between the day
Where I host my purposes

I have entered my purposes
the impulse for my own purposes

I have entered my purchases
entered into my purposes

They have very many choices
elsewhere my purposes

I have entered my phone
the impulse to my purpose

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
to the other end of my purpose

and have no way
aside the impulse to my purpose

I have them trust in me
for my own purposes

I have seen more than I can remember
