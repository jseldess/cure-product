('have', 'purposes')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I tell you my purposes

I have supporters
I tell you the weight of my purposes

I have a memory between the day
Where I host my purposes

If you have confidence regardless all else
I have entered my purposes

I have entered my purchases
the impulse for my own purposes

They have very many choices
elsewhere my purposes

I have entered my phone
for my own purposes

I have them lost
