('have', 'really')

We’ll have coffee this morning
because it was really dark

I have entered my phone
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

as long as I have access to the code
When they really take hold of my finger

If you have confidence regardless all else
without really agreeing

I have a memory between the day
without really speaking

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
also didn’t really move

I have them lost
