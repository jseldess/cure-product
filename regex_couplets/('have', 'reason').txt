('have', 'reason')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
reasons resources

I have entered my phone
with reasons

if you have providence to excess
with little reason to move

If you have confidence regardless all else
More reasons around my country 

I have entered my purposes
and could be inflected with reasons

I have seen more than I can remember
