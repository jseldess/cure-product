('have', 'repeated')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I reach repeated expressions first

before we can have a retroactive
I propogated repeated expressions first

as long as I have access to the code
burrowed about from repeated travels

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
deep into pathways from repeated travels

I have them lost
