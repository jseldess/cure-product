('have', 'rest')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
wrestling to stay still

if you have providence to excess
that agreed one of rest

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Aligned or not with my interests

I have them lost
home rest form to ourselves 

I have seen more than I can remember
