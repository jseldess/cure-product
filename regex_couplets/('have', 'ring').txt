('have', 'ring')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
interferring 

if you have providence to excess
ring

If you have confidence regardless all else
hovering above standing water

I have them lost
storing in surfeit

I have supporters
firing and connecting somewhere

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
The prospect for veering healthily

I have seen more than I can remember
Or can have seen offering possession

can have seen offering possession
You can have seen offering
