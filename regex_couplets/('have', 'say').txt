('have', 'say')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
we had to say goodbye

I have supporters
I ask say in that case

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
we ask say in that case

I have turned it off
formerly along my say to the elections

I have entered my phone
My say to the elections

I have them lost
I ask say in that phase decisioned

I have seen more than I can remember
