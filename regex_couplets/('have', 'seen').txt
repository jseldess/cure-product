('have', 'seen')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
under the last seen principle

I have supporters
Having seen more than 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
being seen by me

I have seen more than I can remember
Or can have seen offering possession

can have seen offering possession
You can have seen offering
