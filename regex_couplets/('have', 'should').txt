('have', 'should')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
You should ask who I am

I have entered my phone
While I should be sleeping

If you have confidence regardless all else
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

I have a memory between the day
they should rise up

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
