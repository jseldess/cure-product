('have', 'side')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Whereas direction is beside the point

I have entered my phone
I’m simply inside

if you have providence to excess
aside from the retinas

If you have confidence regardless all else
But my not feeling the memory aside

I have entered my purposes
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
by the side of the hosting service

I have turned it off
But my not feeling the memory inside

and have no way
By my feeling the memory inside

I have them lost
