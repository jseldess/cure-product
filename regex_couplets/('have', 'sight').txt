('have', 'sight')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
In my sight 

If you have confidence regardless all else
in pursuit of the sight

I have supporters
converting sight

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
my sight hosting

I have entered my phone
converting sight into a purchase

I have turned it off
