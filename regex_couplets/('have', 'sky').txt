('have', 'sky')

We’ll have coffee this morning
over the long time up in the sky

if you have providence to excess
Blue sky or

May I have your zip code
over the long line up in the sky

If you have confidence regardless all else
Up in the sky

I have supporters
While they’re up in the sky

I have a memory between the day
