('have', 'sleep.')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Where I sleep at times

I have entered my phone
That’s where I sleep at times

if you have providence to excess
Interrupted sleep or

May I have your zip code
While I should be sleeping

If you have confidence regardless all else
like flattening sleep 

I have them lost
