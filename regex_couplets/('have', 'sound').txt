('have', 'sound')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
sound inundated for my own purchases

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
by in the sound privacy

I have turned it off
by in the sounded privacy

I have entered my phone
buy in the sound privacy

I have seen more than I can remember
