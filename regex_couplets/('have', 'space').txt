('have', 'space')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
in rotating directionless space

if you have providence to excess
in the space that it had

I have a memory between the day
though we are breaking in the space that it had

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
in the fill space 

I have them lost
