('have', 'stand')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
hovering above standing water

If you have confidence regardless all else
I stand and retrieve the impulse

I have entered my purposes
where I stand and relive

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

I have turned it off
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

and have no way
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

I have entered my phone
where I stand aside

I have them lost
I learned the point of standing

I have them trust in me
