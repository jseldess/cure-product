('have', 'state')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
explicit statements

If you have confidence regardless all else
for an explicit state

I have them lost
I swayed a little in my state

I have supporters
in my state

I have them trust in me
state kept owned impression

I have seen more than I can remember
