('have', 'stay')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
wrestling to stay still

if you have providence to excess
So stay with us

If you have confidence regardless all else
own stays brought loyal

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
own that stays brought loyal

I have turned it off
that stays brought loyal

I have entered my phone
I stay the right of my elections

I have them lost
home stays brought loyal

I have seen more than I can remember
