('have', 'step')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I step off the edge

I have entered my phone
I step over the edge

if you have providence to excess
What the next step

If you have confidence regardless all else
step in by the prospect

I have turned it off
phase decision step in

I have them lost
step by into the prospect

I have seen more than I can remember
stepping off into the middle

Or can have seen offering possession
