('have', 'still')

We’ll have coffee this morning
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

I have entered my phone
That is itself not still

if you have providence to excess
I love my daughter still

If you have confidence regardless all else
though we are still breaking in

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
still wash conserving

I have turned it off
