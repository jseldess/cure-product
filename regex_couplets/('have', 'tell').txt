('have', 'tell')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Then I constellate my time family country

I have entered my phone
So I constellate the time family country

if you have providence to excess
I constellate the time

If you have confidence regardless all else
The CEO tells me to embody values

I have them lost
I tell you my purposes

I have supporters
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I have a memory between the day
and that man comes on to tell me 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
