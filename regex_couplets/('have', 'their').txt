('have', 'their')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
We can wrestle them with their goals

if you have providence to excess
I am not allowed to see their face

If you have confidence regardless all else
without their agreement

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
to their other end

and have no way
that their knowing

I have them lost
