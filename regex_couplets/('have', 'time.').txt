('have', 'time.')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Where I sleep at times

I have entered my phone
only fragments of time with my children

if you have providence to excess
So I constellate the time family country

If you have confidence regardless all else
 and time in the train

May I have your zip code
I spend time online learning to code

I have them lost
in the long time they were on

I have supporters
or alter of course the time anyway

I have a memory between the day
formerly a long time they were on

I have entered my purposes
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

They have very many choices
until a happier time found

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
formerly along time they were on

I have turned it off
time they were on

I have them trust in me
