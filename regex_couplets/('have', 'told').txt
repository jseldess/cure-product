('have', 'told')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I told her a story, she drew waves.

I have entered my phone
I am told ventillation

if you have providence to excess
I am told by no ventillation

If you have confidence regardless all else
which ran to be told

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
