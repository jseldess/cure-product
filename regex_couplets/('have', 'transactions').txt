('have', 'transactions')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
to the ends of my transactions

I have a memory between the day
The ends of my transactions

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
To the ends of transactions

I have turned it off
the other end transactions

and have no way
The other end of transactions like this

I have entered my phone
