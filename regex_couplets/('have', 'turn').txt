('have', 'turn')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
in a sharp downward turn 

I have entered my phone
In a sharp downard turn

before we can have a retroactive
sudden downward turn

if you have providence to excess
I keep turning back again myself

If you have confidence regardless all else
who knows how to turn it off

I have turned it off
I turn not sad exactly

I have them lost
I returned

I have them trust in me
