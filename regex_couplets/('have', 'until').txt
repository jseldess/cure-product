('have', 'until')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
until my purpose up in the sky

if you have providence to excess
until I could not tire 

If you have confidence regardless all else
until I could not be tired

I have them lost
until I purpose up in the sky

I have supporters
until I purchase up the sky

I have a memory between the day
until a happier time found

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
