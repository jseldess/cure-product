('have', 'up?')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Arrayed out in such a nested way

I have entered my phone
In a sharp downard turn

before we can have a retroactive
conversation with our feelings

as long as I have access to the code
The sun isn’t up 

if you have providence to excess
which can be pronounced 

If you have confidence regardless all else
upset by Gingrich

May I have your zip code
I would like your zip code

I have them lost
I have them trust in me

I have supporters
While they’re up in the sky

I have a memory between the day
We had inhabited actually

I have entered my purposes
and elsewhere my memory of you

I have entered my purchases
Then I saw into you

if you have providence
which we can pronounce

They have very many choices
The trackers on users

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

I have turned it off
I end up Bach

and have no way
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

I have seen more than I can remember
I presume to others

Or can have seen offering possession
The sun high enough to strike directly

can have seen offering possession
You can have seen offering
