('have', 'us')

We’ll have coffee this morning
I suspend live connections to you

I have entered my phone
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

as long as I have access to the code
They’re just not mine

if you have providence to excess
I want to cite a poem so usual

If you have confidence regardless all else
was not just a defeat

May I have your zip code
In a vertiginous dream

I have them lost
I have them trust in me

I have supporters
I wear suspenders

I have a memory between the day
in the form filled offered in trust

I have entered my purposes
trackers collecting data on users

They have very many choices
The trackers on users

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

I have turned it off
radiating from housing

I have seen more than I can remember
