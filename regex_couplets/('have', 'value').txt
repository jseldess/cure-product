('have', 'value')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Then I cannot see face value

I have entered my phone
value falling off the edge of the face

before we can have a retroactive
And as an extension of the values

if you have providence to excess
The CEO tells me to embody values

If you have confidence regardless all else
