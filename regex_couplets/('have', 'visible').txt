('have', 'visible')

We’ll have coffee this morning
I assumed it was visible

I have entered my phone
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

if you have providence to excess
Divisible or

May I have your zip code
And make myself a visible

If you have confidence regardless all else
I assume the offers divisible

I have seen more than I can remember
I assumed that they were divisible

Or can have seen offering possession
