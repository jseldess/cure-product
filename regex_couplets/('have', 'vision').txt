('have', 'vision')

We’ll have coffee this morning
I had me a vision

If you have confidence regardless all else
The long time I had a vision

I have them lost
I resume attributable visions

I have supporters
there wasn’t any television 

I have a memory between the day
joined in my television

I have them trust in me
visions that can be attainable

I have seen more than I can remember
