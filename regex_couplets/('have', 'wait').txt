('have', 'wait')

We’ll have coffee this morning
There are spots waiting

I have a memory between the day
Though we are waiting for her

If you have confidence regardless all else
not needing to wait

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Though we can’t help waiting

I have turned it off
waiting out front or up above 

I have them lost
