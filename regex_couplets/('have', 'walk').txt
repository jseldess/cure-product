('have', 'walk')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Before we walk across the wide field

I have entered my phone
Before we walk across the wide opening

before we can have a retroactive
Before anyone walks across the opening

as long as I have access to the code
there was no walking along the pleasure

If you have confidence regardless all else
walking into percents blending themselves

I have them lost
