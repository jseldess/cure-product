('have', 'want')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
When I want something

before we can have a retroactive
I want to find a way to block it incoming

as long as I have access to the code
I want but not to impart cynicism

if you have providence to excess
I want to cite a poem so usual

If you have confidence regardless all else
all that I can think I want

I have them lost
