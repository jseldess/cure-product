('have', 'ways')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

I have entered my phone
always watching

I have them lost
deep into pathways from repeated travels

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
with constant ways 

I have turned it off
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

and have no way
There are constant ways

I have them trust in me
