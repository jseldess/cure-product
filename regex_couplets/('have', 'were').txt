('have', 'were')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
When we had jobs that were to earn

if you have providence to excess
my desires were open

If you have confidence regardless all else
they were on

I have them lost
in the long time they were on

I have supporters
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

I have a memory between the day
formerly a long time they were on

I have entered my purposes
answered about 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
by the sight of the hosting answered about

I have entered my phone
I answered about

I have turned it off
I answered what I thought

I have them trust in me
that they were visible

I have seen more than I can remember
I assumed that they were divisible

Or can have seen offering possession
