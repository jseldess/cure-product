('have', 'When')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
When I woke up in the morning

I have entered my phone
When I want something

before we can have a retroactive
When we had jobs that were to earn

if you have providence to excess
When they really take hold of my finger

If you have confidence regardless all else
When closed to my knowing

I have supporters
When I'm watching my tv 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
