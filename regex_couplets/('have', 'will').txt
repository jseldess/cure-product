('have', 'will')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

if you have providence to excess
will not be the same

If you have confidence regardless all else
that will spur me on

I have supporters
would only willingly break

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
my daughter will learn 

I have turned it off
