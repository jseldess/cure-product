('have', 'world')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
off the edge of the world

I have entered my phone
Which can be pronounced to the world

if you have providence to excess
The world 

If you have confidence regardless all else
off the end of the world

I have them lost
the opinions in my world

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
