('have', 'you.')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Though how can you know without direction

if you have providence to excess
You can hear it also through your leisure

If you have confidence regardless all else
May I have your zip code

I have them lost
a futile joyous white sun

I have supporters
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I have a memory between the day
This is your voice 

I have entered my purposes
This is your chance

if you have providence
the young ripples inaudibly

I have them trust in me
