('having', 'A')

After having been contented
BREAK

that having been after content
UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON

and continue along having 
All that I can think I want

having been graspable
As a clone, illegally conceived

having been an ungraspable time
COPY DREAM 

having been purchased out
Articles all around us

having supporters 
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

useless for not having paid
CONTRACT

seen having or offering possession
