('having', 'so')

After having been contented
reasons resources

that having been after content
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

and continue along having 
than solid ground

having been graspable
If I take some different measure

having been an ungraspable time
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

having supporters 
so that nothing had gravity

useless for not having paid
so still watch them

seen having or offering possession
