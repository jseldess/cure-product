('having', 'To')

After having been contented
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

that having been after content
Tomorrow 

and continue along having 
Toward the start informally given my reasons

having been graspable
To neither study

useless for not having paid
To the ends of transactions

seen having or offering possession
