('having', 'any')

After having been contented
Or the company

that having been after content
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

and continue along having 
there wasn’t any television 

having been graspable
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

having been an ungraspable time
without any further damage

useless for not having paid
latency which doesn’t mean anything

seen having or offering possession
