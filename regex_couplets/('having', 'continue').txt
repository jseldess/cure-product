('having', 'continue')

After having been contented
but it continued

and continue along having 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

that having been after content
I continue to presume

having been graspable
I continue to subsume

having been an ungraspable time
I continue to consume

having been purchased out
Then I continue to dream then

having been purchased out of you
I continued to dream then

having supporters
