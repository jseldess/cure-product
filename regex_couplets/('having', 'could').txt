('having', 'could')

After having been contented
and could be mapped and weighed

that having been after content
until I could not tire 

having been graspable
I could consume the dream

having been an ungraspable time
I could in effect credit

having been purchased out
and we could inhabit the room easy

useless for not having paid
and could be inflected with reasons

seen having or offering possession
