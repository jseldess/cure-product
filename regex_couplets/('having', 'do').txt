('having', 'do')

After having been contented
The dogs and lillies

that having been after content
What I do in my liesure

and continue along having 
I walk up and don’t work anymore

having been graspable
here is the site of the battle of maldon

having been an ungraspable time
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

having supporters 
around the dogs and lillies

useless for not having paid
latency which doesn’t mean anything

seen having or offering possession
