('having', 'has')

After having been contented
It has been since

that having been after content
in traversing my purchase

and continue along having 
purchased out

having been purchased out
having been purchased out of you

having supporters 
until I purchase up the sky

useless for not having paid
if that has anything

seen having or offering possession
