('having', 'here')

After having been contented
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

that having been after content
there was no promotion

and continue along having 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

having been graspable
I get through there

having been an ungraspable time
And we had to say goodbye to her there

having supporters 
where I need gravity

useless for not having paid
Where in me did I host

seen having or offering possession
