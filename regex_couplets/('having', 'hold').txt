('having', 'hold')

After having been contented
I take hold of my finger

that having been after content
Since I had to hold the entire company

and continue along having 
and hold and wish to hold

having been graspable
designed to hold up my underwear

having supporters 
that hold and wish to hold

useless for not having paid
