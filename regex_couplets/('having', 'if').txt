('having', 'if')

After having been contented
if you have providence to excess

that having been after content
That company creates a life

and continue along having 
If I take a different measure

having been graspable
If I take some different measure

having been an ungraspable time
if there is anything 

useless for not having paid
if that has anything

seen having or offering possession
