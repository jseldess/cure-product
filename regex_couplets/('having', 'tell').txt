('having', 'tell')

After having been contented
So I constellate the time family country

that having been after content
I had to tell them the news

and continue along having 
I tell you my purposes

having supporters 
I tell you the weight of my purchases

useless for not having paid
and that man comes on to tell me 

seen having or offering possession
