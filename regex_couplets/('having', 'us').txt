('having', 'us')

After having been contented
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

that having been after content
I just got a letter

and continue along having 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

having been graspable
a futile joyous white sun

having been an ungraspable time
Articles all around us

having supporters 
suspenders

useless for not having paid
uses for the attention of the brand

seen having or offering possession
