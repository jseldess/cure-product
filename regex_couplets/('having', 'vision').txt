('having', 'vision')

After having been contented
I had me a vision

that having been after content
The planning process for visions

and continue along having 
there wasnâ€™t any television 

having been graspable
of attributable visions

having been an ungraspable time
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

useless for not having paid
joined in my television

seen having or offering possession
