('he', 'As')

But that is beside the point
Ask who I am to suspend

Where I sleep at times
Ask who I am

Whereas direction is beside the point
As though stationary and a destination

The edge isnâ€™t even there
Assimilable or

 and time in the train
Aspirational strategy

I can see only the back of falling values
As an extension of the values

that potential is there for you
As a clone, illegally conceived

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
