('he', 'Thou')

But that is beside the point
Though there are quarters goals

They’re just not mine
Though how can you know without direction

I step over the edge
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Though in not many acts

Though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

not the simple act
Though it is not a simple act

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
Though we are waiting for her

to the ends of my transactions
Though we are breaking 

I stand and retrieve the impulse
Though we are waiting 

all parties would be held
Though we can’t help waiting

The way that I was going
Though we can’t help waiting for her

with her way to the ends
