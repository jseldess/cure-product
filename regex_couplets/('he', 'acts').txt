('he', 'acts')

But that is beside the point
I refuse indelible tracts

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I refuse indelible contracts

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
though not many facts up in the sky

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Though in not many acts

Though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

not the simple act
