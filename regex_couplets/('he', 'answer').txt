('he', 'answer')

But that is beside the point
for the duration of the answer

for the creation of the universe
answered about 

from cables reheated travels
the duration of answers

But my not feeling the memory aside
for the duration of answers

where I blend and relive
by the sight of the hosting answered about

by the side of the hosting service
I answered about

washed
washed I answered about

washed by my memory
I answered what I thought

formerly my way to the elections
at least for the duration of the answer

where I am aside at least
I answered while interfaced

battery dawn nights ending themselves
I answered what I thought about

in the long time they were on
