('he', 'aspiration')

But that is beside the point
They are called aspirational

your bid to the next highest ranked network
with little reasons to aspiration

And as an extension of the values
embodied aspirations

off the end myself
full of aspirations

The days were long aligned
with little reason to aspiration

As an extension of the values
embodied with little aspirations

that potential is there for you
