('he', 'bill')

But that is beside the point
between bills and stuffed animals

by the private preambles
I hear it between bills and stuff

off the edge of the world
I can hear it between bills and stuff

The ads in mine
I can hear them between bills and stuff

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

in not many tracks up in the sky
I cannot hear it between bills

and stuff up in the sky
billowing in the cloud

without the long time I was on accounting
until the bill came

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
the bill my detuning 

abjure them with determining 
bills and stuffed animals

I presume the offers
