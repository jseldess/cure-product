('he', 'blend')

But that is beside the point
battery dawn nights blending themselves

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
walking into percents blending themselves

talking into the cents
where I blend and relive

The ends of my transactions
where lights blended themselves

where rights ended themselves
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

drawn formerly rights blended themselves
