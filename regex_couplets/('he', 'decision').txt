('he', 'decision')

But that is beside the point
the planning process for decisions

I see the back of falling values
attributable decisions

I get through there
forgetting decisions 

I presume to others
decisioned to learn 

speak them of my possessions
decisioned to learn back

stopping into the prospect
decisioned by the prospect

by in the sounded privacy
phase decisioned by the prospect

by in the sound privacy
phase decisioned

for learning by the prospect
that decisions can be attributable

the way was water
I ask say in that phase decisioned

step by into the prospect
decisions that can be attributable

phrase them
phase decision for learning

I speak them of my possessions
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

The sun high enough to strike directly
