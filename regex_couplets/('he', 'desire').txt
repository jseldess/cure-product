('he', 'desire')

But that is beside the point
others desires

The dogs and lillies
If I let myself see others desires

where I sleep at times
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I canâ€™t presume to need others
Others desires as legitimate

Then I cannot see face value
my desires were open

Out of the remnants 
I wish my desires were open

and could be mapped and weighed
a similar desire against me

not back in the results
