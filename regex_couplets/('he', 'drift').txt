('he', 'drift')

But that is beside the point
drifting away

Before we walk across the wide field
drifting does not feel an exception

The dogs and lillies
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I canâ€™t presume to need others
at any time it can drift again

others desires
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I constellate my time family country
For whom drifting is not an exception

without imparting the cynicism
What does it mean to drift

the drifting is not something special
Walt Whitman drifted

Then I cannot see face value
drifting away needs

There are quarterly goals
drifting away from the task

in a moment of drifting away from the task
