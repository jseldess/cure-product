('he', 'eat')

But that is beside the point
too sunny to eat ice cream

Then fall then summer from my face
I reach repeated expressions first

The sun isn’t up 
I propogated repeated expressions first

Before anyone buys up the opening
skin smile repeated expressions

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
But I can’t let myself treat 

others desires
Then I can’t presume to treat others

In the right sense
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

here described
I let myself treat

Then I constellate my time family country
executive breath

Face falling off the edge of the face
execute breath

Falling off the edge of the face
was not just a defeat

 and time in the train
Where I put it beating

Out of the remnants 
of the habits I create

upsent in the afternoon
of the habits they create

I can see only the back of their economic value
they create

increasingly that their economic value
of the habits they create.

What’s the next step
That company creates a life

And as an extension of the values
it was not just a defeat

advancing the time
And from that great distance

around the dogs and lillies
And from a great distance

While we’re up in the sky
for the creation of the universe

for the duration of the universe
burrowed about from repeated travels

from cables reheated travels
deep into pathways from repeated travels

where I send and relive
