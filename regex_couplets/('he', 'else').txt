('he', 'else')

But that is beside the point
If you have confidence regardless all else

only in the case
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

While weâ€™re up in the sky 
and elsewhere my memory

and other types of tracking technology
and elsewhere my memory of you

Then I saw into you
elsewhere my purposes

washed my purchases
elsewhere by my memory

washed by my memory
By my memory elsewhere

washed I answered about
in memory elsewhere

in the long time they were on
but for memory elsewhere

in memory persisting elsewhere
