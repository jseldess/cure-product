('he', 'ending')

But that is beside the point
battery dawn nights blending themselves

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I argued the days felt longer
talking into pheasants bending themselves

The long time I had a vision
talking into percents bending themselves

without the long time I was accounting
walking into percents blending themselves

talking into the cents
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

But my not feeling the memory aside
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in memory elsewhere
