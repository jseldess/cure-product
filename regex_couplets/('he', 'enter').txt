('he', 'enter')

But that is beside the point
I have entered my phone

Before we walk across the wide opening
The sun high enough to enter directly 

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I enter the flattening mirror

the cloud
I have entered my purposes

and elsewhere my memory of you
I have entered my purchases

Then I saw into you
entered into my purposes

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
I had entered my phone

battery dawn nights blending themselves
