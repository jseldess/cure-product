('he', 'graspable')

But that is beside the point
having been graspable

I get through there
having been an ungraspable time

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
for an ungraspable purchase

My purpose up in the sky
For an ungraspable time

under the grasp principle
And for an ungraspable time

they can be waived
