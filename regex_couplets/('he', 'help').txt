('he', 'help')

But that is beside the point
people would be helped

They have very many choices
The constituents would be helped

all parties would be helped
in the form help sale offered

in help in the form of a sale offered
in being offered help

In my heart did I lose trust
Bach helps turn it off

Selma helps too
Though we can’t help waiting

The way that I was going
Though we can’t help waiting for her

to the ends of my transactions
My daughter helps too

Though we are waiting for her
