('he', 'how')

But that is beside the point
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
how can I know without direction

The edge is put in place
Though how can you know without direction

I step over the edge
for how can you know without direction

If I step over the edge
who knows how to turn it off

Though we are waiting for her
