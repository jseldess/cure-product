('he', 'joined')

But that is beside the point
I was enjoined to act again myself

The South Carolina primary 
I was enjoined to act again

before the sunâ€™s deflections
I was enjoined to act

I argued the days were longer
I am enjoined to act again

off the end myself
I was enjoined to act against

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
joined in my television

By my memory elsewhere
