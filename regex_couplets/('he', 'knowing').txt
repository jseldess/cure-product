('he', 'knowing')

But that is beside the point
even when close to my knowing

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
When closed to my knowing

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
knowing the constituents

the opinions in my world
that their knowing

The weight kept moaned impression
