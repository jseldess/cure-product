('he', 'literal')

But that is beside the point
and literally moved

if there is anything 
as it was designed literally

where I send and relive would be held
and literally unproved

I stand and retrieve the impulse
literally unproved 

they should rise up
myself moved literally as it is

and for which the plan agreed
when it is not literal

Where in me did I host
I literally moved

when I move
and itâ€™s not literal

in the form filled offered in trust
and move them literally with me

I literally move them
literally move

The floor slanted in places
and literally moved about

and to which the plan agreed
literally moved

in the space that it had
what literally moved

in the face that it had
not literally moved about

washed I answered about
not literally moved

I stay the right of my elections
