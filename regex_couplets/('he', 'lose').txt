('he', 'lose')

But that is beside the point
even when close to my owning

I get from here through there
even when close to my knowing

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
even when closed

When closed to my knowing
Where in me did I lose

in the form filled offered in trust
Where in me did I lose trust

in the form filled offered
In my heart did I lose trust

Where did I lose trust in me
Where did we lose trust

To the ends of transactions
