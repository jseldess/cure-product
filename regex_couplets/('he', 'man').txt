('he', 'man')

But that is beside the point
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

The dogs and lillies
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

The sun isn’t up
To my children Walt Whitman

Then fall then summer
Walt Whitman

without imparting the cynicism
Walt Whitman drifted

Then I cannot see face value
There are performance reviews

And as an extension of the values
not many face up

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
though not many freeze up

up in the television pleasure
though not many facts up in the sky

talking into pheasants bending themselves
in not many tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
Though in not many acts

Though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

not the simple act
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
They have very many choices

The trackers on users
and that man comes on to tell me 

– The Rolling Stones
The many transparent pixel calls

who know the way to their other end
The many transparent pixels call

to the other end
of the many transparent pixel calls

But my not feeling the memory inside
