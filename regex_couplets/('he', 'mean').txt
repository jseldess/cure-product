('he', 'mean')

But that is beside the point
What does it mean to drift

the drifting is not something special
My means without gravity

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

the resemblance
The other end of means

The way that I was going
To the other end of means like this one

Like this one the other end of means
