('he', 'mine')

But that is beside the point
They’re just not mine

Actually one day there is direction
The third letter from the end is mine

It’s the third letter from the end
The ads in mine

off the end of the world
To the right of determined elections

To the right of interned possessions
determined by elections

To the right of deterred elections
