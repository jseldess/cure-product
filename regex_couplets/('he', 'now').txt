('he', 'now')

But that is beside the point
On a snow day with my children

Before we walk across the wide field
who knows the way

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

interjecting into the stream of pictures
how can I know without direction

The edge is put in place
Though how can you know without direction

I step over the edge
for how can you know without direction

If I step over the edge
Right now I’m the cart

Face falling off the edge of the face
out in the snow

Then the sun isn’t available
out in the snow fall

out in the snow falling face value
I take it out in the snow fall

I can hear it between bills and stuff
I even know what I would find

will not be the same
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

talking into pheasants bending themselves
even when close to my knowing

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
When closed to my knowing

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
knowing the constituents

the opinions in my world
who knows how to turn it off

Though we are waiting for her
who know the ways to their other end

But my not feeling the memory inside
who know the way to their other end

The many transparent pixels call
that their knowing

The weight kept moaned impression
