('he', 'offer')

But that is beside the point
So I presume the offers already

The prospects there already
in the form filled offered in trust

Elsewhere by my memory
in the form filled offered trust

washed by my memory
in the form filled offered must

pre-worn and still wash them
in the form filled offered

in the form help sale offered
in help in the form of a sale offered

in being offered help
in track as offer asked 

bought in the surrounded privacy 
I assume the offers reliable

I assume the offers revisitable
I assume the offers divisible

that they were visible
I presume the offers

by the private preambles
The offers there already

The prospects being seen by me
So I resume the offers already

So I presume the offers
So I presume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home

presume the offers at 
Or can have seen offering possession

I presume to others
and can see offering

The sun high enough to strike directly
seen having or offering possession

I assume possession to others
in school and can see offering

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
can have seen offering possession
