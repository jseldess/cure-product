('he', 'open')

But that is beside the point
Before we walk across the wide opening

who knows the way
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

In the light of retroactive
Before anyone buys up the opening

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the opening
my desires were open

Out of the remnants 
I wish my desires were open

and could be mapped and weighed
The simple act opening surmounted

The simple act of opening surmounted
in the simple act of opening a book

in the simple act of opening an accountant
