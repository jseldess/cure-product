('he', 'plan')

But that is beside the point
and is relentlessly planned

In the right sense
The planning process for visions

upsent in the afternoon
I see the back of the planning process

blue and sun again a second, then night
The planning process is for visionaries only

What the next step
the planning process for decisions

I see the back of falling values
and for which the plan agreed

when it is not literal
and to which the plan agreed

when I move
