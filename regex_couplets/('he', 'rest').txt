('he', 'rest')

But that is beside the point
wrestling to stay still

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
We can wrestle them with their goals

We can rest there in them with their goals
that agreed one of rest

speak them of my possessions
Aligned or not with my interests

battery dawn nights blending themselves
 as points which are my interest 

I stay the right of my elections
home rest form to ourselves 

the people in own form
