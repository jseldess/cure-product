('he', 'ring')

But that is beside the point
interferring 

interjecting into the stream of pictures
bring your child along

without imparting the cynicism
bearing children along

the drifting is not something special
ring

Then I can’t presume to need others
hovering above standing water

I’ll get there eventually
actually considering the end

falling off the encoded end
the simple act of honoring an accountant

the simple act of opening surmounted
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

talking into percents bending themselves
wearing trying talking into it

I enter the flattening mirror
storing in surfeit

Under the last principle of purchasing power
firing and connecting somewhere

where I send and receive
The prospect for veering healthily

between the preambles
The prospect for steering healthily

stepping in the middle
Or can have seen offering possession

I presume to others
and can see offering

The sun high enough to strike directly
seen having or offering possession

I assume possession to others
in school and can see offering

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
can have seen offering possession
