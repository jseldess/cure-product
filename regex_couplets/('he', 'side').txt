('he', 'side')

But that is beside the point
Whereas direction is beside the point

Where I sleep at times
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
I’m simply inside

The sun isn’t up 
aside from the retinas

I argued that the days were longer
actually considering the end

falling off the encoded end
But my not feeling the memory aside

I stand and retrieve the impulse
where I send and relive aside

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
where I send and retrieve aside

the impulse for my own purposes
where I stand aside

the impulse to my purpose
aside the impulse to my purpose

where I stand aside and retrieve
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

I stand and retrieve the impuse
But my not feeling the memory inside

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
where I am aside at least

for the duration of the answer
where I am aside

the duration of answers
by the side of the hosting service

by the side of the road
By my feeling the memory inside

There are constant ways
44 seconds inside

on the other end
But my feeling the memory aside

firing and connecting somewhere
where I am aside increased

where I am decided least
recalling aside

By my memory elsewhere
