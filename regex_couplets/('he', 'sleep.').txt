('he', 'sleep.')

But that is beside the point
Where I sleep at times

Whereas direction is beside the point
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
That’s where I sleep at times

to the pillow
Interrupted sleep or

 and time in the train
While I should be sleeping

I’ll get there eventually
Looking back while I should be sleeping

with my head
While I should sleep not back in the results

Back in the results pages
like flattening sleep 

talking into percents bending themselves
