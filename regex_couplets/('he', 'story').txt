('he', 'story')

But that is beside the point
I told her a story, she drew waves.

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
Forecasting the story before dawn

The sun shielding 
as far back as my history heard

What was the last time
You need history

The long time I had a vision
for to tire as far back as my history

The long time I was a vision
for as far back as my history

until I purpose the horizon
