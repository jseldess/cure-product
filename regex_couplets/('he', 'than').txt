('he', 'than')

But that is beside the point
It keeps coming down thankfully

Then fall then summer
than in the incoming stream

before anyone has walked across the opening
than solid ground

because there was no solid ground to continue along
Having seen more than 

I speak them of my possessions
Having seen more than I can remember 

I presume to others
