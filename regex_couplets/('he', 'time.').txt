('he', 'time.')

But that is beside the point
Where I sleep at times

Whereas direction is beside the point
Then I constellate my time family country

Before we walk across the wide field
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
only fragments of time with my children

Then fall then summer
at any time it can drift again

others desires
over the long time up in the sky

I’ll get there eventually
That’s where I sleep at times

to the pillow
So I constellate the time family country

The South Carolina primary 
on the time line I was on

way high up in the internet
over the time line I was on

I am the first in the office
 and time in the train

Then I cannot see face value
I spend time online learning to code

Spinning around the heart
On the timeline I was on

The timeline
over the long time I was on

until my purpose up in the sky
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

It’s the third letter from the end
The long time I had a vision

without the long time I was accounting
The long time I was a vision

until I purpose the horizon
which is the long time I was on

talking into percents bending themselves
without the long time I was on accounting

without accounting the long time I was on
the long time I was on

they were on
in the long time they were on

I have them lost
or alter of course the time anyway

Though we are waiting for her
formerly a long time they were on

if there is anything 
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

washed my memory
until a happier time found

the resemblance
formerly along time they were on

I speak them of my possessions
time they were on

on a way to the elections
formerly along the time they were on

My say to the elections
