('he', 'tire')

But that is beside the point
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

there was no promotion
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

I agrued the days were longer
The entire company

off the end myself
Since I had to hold the entire company

The days long aligned
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

that I was the arm of this
until I could not tire 

What was the last time
until I could not be tired

as far back as my history heard
for to tire as far back as my history

The long time I had a vision
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
