('he', 'up?')

But that is beside the point
Ask who I am to suspend

Where I sleep at times
I upend my connections to you

Whereas direction is beside the point
I suspend my connections to you

The dogs and lillies
I assumed it was visible

into the stream of pictures
The sun isn’t up 

I step off the edge
So I presume the offers already

The prospects there already
between bills and stuffed animals

by the private preambles
Then I cannot see face value

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

off the edge of the world
I’ll get there eventually

Then I constellate my time family country
reasons resources

Before we walk across the wide field
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

into the minority proportion of time
because it was really dark

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

What is an impure product

When I woke up in the morning
it was really sunny

Then fall then summer from my face
my children’s consumption

Before we walk across the wide opening
In a sharp downard turn

Face falling off the edge of the face
value falling off the edge of the face

Then fall then summer
such as I see

In the light of retroactive conversations
conversations with our purchase

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
conversations with our reactions

In the light of retroactive 
conversations with our feelings

Of course there is a direction
conversation with our feelings

Before anyone buys up the opening
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

When I want something
interjecting into the stream of pictures

One day there is direction
One day was actually

Though there are quarters goals
They’re just not mine

Actually one day there is direction
Put in place as stationary destinations

The edge is put in place
As though stationary and a destination

The edge isn’t even there
And put in place as though stationary

I can’t fix them without direction
there are quarters 

We can wrestle them with their goals
Though how can you know without direction

I step over the edge
though there are quarters with goals

with goals I find there
for how can you know without direction

If I step over the edge
slow asynchronous

others desires
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

You can hear it also through your leisure
Which is a measure to never live out

Then I can’t presume to need others
as an impure product

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
as a pure product

In the right sense
Without a proposed budget

Without a head
and without quartely goals

without imparting the cynicism
Puffs of air

I am first in the office 
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

over the long time up in the sky
in a sharp downward turn 

There are quarterly goals
And as an extension of the values

The South Carolina primary 
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

here described
But I can’t let myself treat 

to the down arrow
sudden downward turn

Others desires as legitimate
executive breath

So I constellate the time family country
way high up in the inter

Falling off the edge of the face
The value falling off the edge of the face

Right now I’m the cart
I’ll pull my data higher up

higher up in the internet
I’ll pull myself higher up

high up in the internet
way high up in the internet

Then
by no ventillation my purpose

I am the first in the office
to be before the sun

over the long line up in the sky
over the long line I would honor

until my purpose up in the sky
out in the snow

Then the sun isn’t available
Then the sun isn’t up 

Did he carry one virtue to excess
Which can be pronounced to the world

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
Which is a pleasure to never live out

the latter
upset by Gingrich

If he had not carried one virtue
if you have providence to excess

The world 
I want to cite a poem so usual

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
But in more 

I constellate the time
not one virtue to excess

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
when we had jobs that was to churn some bread

only in the case
To neither study

 and time in the train
May I have your zip code

I brought my head down
I brought my qualities down

and my heart rate
I keep turning back again myself

with my head
In a vertiginous dream

Where official policy is to catch and release
A turtle fished out of the lake

The leaves curdled on the tree out front
Some disease effecting the tree out front

fish pulled out of the lake
in a continuous vertiginous dream

The CEO tells me to embody values
But not to me directly

Or the company
Spinning around the heart

You use the most essential parts
Even before the skills aquired

When they really take hold of my finger
While I should be sleeping 

That’s when they really take
Looking back while I should be sleeping

In a continuous theme
I put my bread down

I put my head down
and could be mapped and weighed

could map to the dimnsions of a graph
I keep turning back

I log in and search with my head
impulse control

not back in the results
While I should sleep not back in the results

Back in the results pages
Back up through the results

On the bandwidth I was on
out of remnant ages

higher up in the results
So I was advised to back up

rewind before the sun
Back up before the sun

back up the results
back up before the results

before the sun’s deflections
out of later results

I’ll get there ruins
Eventually

high in the content architecture
out from below the fold

out of the fifth page ruins
high up in the results

where I can lay claim to ruins
high up in the architecture

where I can claim to see the ruins
to see the ruins

from where I can claim to see the mosquitos
emerging this year from too much standing water

to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water
to see the sunrise

high up in the content architecture
I hear it between bills and stuff

On the timeline I was on

The sun shielding from

I am told by the ventillation
The ventillation rushes on

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

but the sun isn’t up
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

It’s the third letter from the end
I just got a letter

The third letter from the end is mine
I see only the back of falling values

blue and sun again a second, then night
upsent in the afternoon

I see only the back
of my economic value

I see the back of the planning process
I see the back of falling values

The planning process for visions
I can see only values falling back

What the next step
an upsent afternoon

I see only the back of my habits
I can see only the back of falling values

out in the snow fall
out in the snow falling face value

then I can see only the back of values
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I argued the days felt longer
of the economic value my habits

of the habits I create
of the economic value

then I can see only the back values
I can see only the back of their economic value

Their economic value
That you can see only the back of

increasingly that their economic value

is a function of the strength
and key value

I tried to feel the extension of key values

I argued the days were longer

off the end of the world
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

there was no promotion
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

I agrued the days were longer
but it continued

off the end myself
or argued for them at least

The days aligned for company
I am full of potential

The days are long
I argued that the days were longer

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
with full potential to movement

that I was the arm of this
since you can imagine movement

across the retinas
full of aspirations

The days were long aligned
The days of public quantity

The days of private data
So stay with us

As an extension of the values
that potential is there for you

The days were long
but it continued rippling muscle

The days of quantity 
The days of public data

The days of parsing data
full of potential

There was very little physical activity
I can hear it between bills and stuff

The ads in mine
Would I love the same stuff

falling off the encoded end
white spots on a black surface

but would I love her the same
If I take a different measure

talking into pheasants bending themselves
without the long time I was accounting

Where I take my liesure
I take it out in the snow fall

Would I love the same
Undoubtedly 

there was no walking along the pleasure
no solid ground to continue along

there was no walking along
where you can earn more 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
walking along the measure

walking from home along the measure
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

The long time I had a vision
I resume unassimilable visions

The first language
First language

The first falling syllable
hauling off the end of the world

but they are black spots
black spots on a white surface

as far back as my history heard
I reuse indelible tracks

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I even know what I would find

will not be the same
that I hear without trying

falling off the end
actually considering the end

The first track
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

What was the last time
I refuse indelible tracts

On the other hand
though not many freeze up

up in the television pleasure
though not many facts up in the sky

up in the television
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

but I can hear them
in traversing my purchase

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I cannot hear it between bills
and stuff up in the sky

Though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

not the simple act
While we’re up in the sky

in the simple act of reading
Can I clear it through emphatic seizure

The simple act opening surmounted
You can clear it also through static seizure

The simple act of opening surmounted
the simple act of honoring an accountant

in the simple act of opening a book
in the simple act of opening an accountant

You can hear it also through static leisure
You can clear it also through static leisure

The sun high enough to enter directly 
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

advancing the time
around my country 

but where is it
Then I saw into you

Then I saw them interview
If you have confidence regardless all else

The long time I was a vision
until I could not be tired

until I purpose the horizon
the clouds hinged the horizon

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
I resume attributable visions

of my purpose in versing

I get through there
in versing my surfeit

in the sense of watching
I could in effect credit

in the long time they were on
I have them trust in me

in pursuit of the sight
that will spur me on

even when close to my owning
of my purpose in conversing

I get from here through there
I get here through there

even when close to my knowing
in conversing of my purpose

even when closed

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
a futile joyous white sun

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Under the grass principle
having been an ungraspable time

Then I continue to dream then
I could consume the dream

Then I continued to dream then
Then I continued to dream

Under the grasp principle
having been purchased out

Under the last principle 
having been purchased out of you

Under the last principle of purchasing power
she lay under the grass

of those gathered
for an ungraspable purchase

My purpose up in the sky
Sweets and coffee and juice

Under the past prinicple
articles all around storming around

under the past principle
Articles all around us

We had to say goodbye there
For an ungraspable time

We had to buy there
And need out in front purchase

Even the children
Until my purpose 

up in the sky
I tell you my purposes

they can be waived
I have supporters

While they’re up in the sky
I tell you the weight of my purchases

until I purpose up in the sky
my purchase up in the sky

until I purchase up in the sky
And reached up the screen

there wasn’t any television 
I wear suspenders

where I need gravity
And for an ungraspable time

around the dogs and lillies
I spin around

Where I lead gravity
while consuming damage

I continued to dream then
around 

until I purchase up the sky
designed to hold up my underwear

I designed them to hold up my underwear
having supporters 

until I purchase the sky
I spun around trying to touch the spots

There are spots waiting
until my purchase up in the sky

my purchse up in the sky
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

They can be weighed
One was up where it should be down

I tell you the weight of my purposes
weight of my purposes

I tell you where I need gravity
Is the weight of my purchases

Is the weight of my click or zipcode
I captured an afterimage

without any further damage
to any consumer damage

until the bill came
My means without gravity

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
full of the missing words

that of the man with the dyed blond hair
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
