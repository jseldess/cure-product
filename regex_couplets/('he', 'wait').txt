('he', 'wait')

But that is beside the point
There are spots waiting

until I purchase up in the sky
Though we are waiting for her

to the ends of my transactions
not needing to wait

from cables reheated travels
Though we are waiting 

all parties would be held
Though we can’t help waiting

The way that I was going
Though we can’t help waiting for her

with her way to the ends
waiting out front or up above 

the right of possessions
waiting out front or up above or behind

in the fill space out front
