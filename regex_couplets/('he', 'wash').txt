('he', 'wash')

But that is beside the point
washed by my memory

in the space that it had
washed my memory

people would be helped
washed my purchases

elsewhere my purposes
still wash conserving

pre-worn and still wash them
my in-laws still wash conserving

Where in me pre-worn
washed

who knows the way
washed I answered about

so still them
so still washed

 them
