('he', 'you.')

But that is beside the point
Though how can you know without direction

I step over the edge
for how can you know without direction

If I step over the edge
You can hear it also through your leisure

The dogs and lillies
bring your child along

without imparting the cynicism
if you have providence to excess

The world 
If you have confidence regardless all else

only in the case
May I have your zip code

Then I cannot see face value
That you can see only the back of

What the next step
your bid to the next highest ranked network

the next network in your ranking
since you can imagine movement

The days are long
where you can earn more 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
you need history

The long time I was a vision
a futile joyous white sun

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
I tell you my purposes

they can be waived
I tell you the weight of my purchases

until I purpose up in the sky
I tell you the weight of my purposes

They can be weighed
I tell you where I need gravity

Is the weight of my purchases
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

that of the man with the dyed blond hair
This is your voice 

To neither study
This is your choice 

To substitute neither study
This is your chance

I send and retrieve the impulse
the young ripples inaudibly

the void kept owned impression
