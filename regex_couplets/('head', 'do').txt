('head', 'do')

Without a head
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I brought my head down
I brought my qualities down

with my head
the dogs and lillies

I search with my head
which I brought down with qualities

I put my head down
I put my bread down

I log in and search with my head
I brought my count down

into the next level head
What I do in my liesure

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything
