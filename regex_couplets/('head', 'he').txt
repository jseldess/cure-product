('head', 'he')

Without a head
Then I constellate my time family country

I brought my head down
and my heart rate

with my head
Then fall then summer

I search with my head
Thatâ€™s when they really take

I put my head down
and could be mapped and weighed

and the graph ahead of me
When they really take hold of my finger

I log in and search with my head
In a continuous theme

into the next level head
The planning process is for visionaries only

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
