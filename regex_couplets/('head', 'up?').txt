('head', 'up?')

Without a head
and without quartely goals

I brought my head down
I brought my qualities down

with my head
Then fall then summer

I search with my head
While I should be sleeping 

I put my head down
and could be mapped and weighed

and the graph ahead of me
I keep turning back

I log in and search with my head
impulse control

into the next level head
And as an extension of the values

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
