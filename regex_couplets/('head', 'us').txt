('head', 'us')

Without a head
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I brought my head down
In a vertiginous dream

I search with my head
in a continuous vertiginous dream

I put my head down
In a continuous theme

with my head
The ventillation rushes on

into the next level head
So stay with us

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
