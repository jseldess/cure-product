('hear', 'A')

You can hear it also through your leisure
And as an extension of the values

and my heart rate
A turtle fished out of the lake

and my heartrate
A person from a distance

Spinning around the heart
And make myself a visible

I hear it between bills and stuff
As an extension of the values

I can hear it between bills and stuff
All that I can think I want

as far back as my history heard
A defeated

In my heart did I lose trust
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
