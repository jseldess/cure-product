('hear', 'so')

You can hear it also through your leisure
reasons resources

and my heart rate
A person from a distance

Spinning around the heart
Even before the lesson starts

I hear it between bills and stuff
or an available resource

I can hear it between bills and stuff
If I take some different measure

that I can hear
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I cannot clear it also through investiture

but I can hear them
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

You can hear it also through static leisure
You can clear it also through static leisure

as far back as my history heard
I want to cite a poem so usual

In my heart did I lose trust
by in the sound privacy
