('hear', 'That')

You can hear it also through your leisure
That’s where I sleep at times

and my heart rate
That’s when they really take

I hear it between bills and stuff
That you can see only the back of

I can hear it between bills and stuff
That I captured an afterimage

In my heart did I lose trust
That are my right to say
