('hear', 'There')

You can hear it also through your leisure
There are quarterly goals

and my heart rate
There was very little physical activity

I hear it between bills and stuff
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

as far back as my history heard
There are spots waiting

In my heart did I lose trust
There are constant ways
