('hear', 'Thou')

You can hear it also through your leisure
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I can hear it between bills and stuff
Though in not many acts

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
Though in not many facts

You can hear it also through static leisure
Though we are waiting for her

In my heart did I lose trust
Though we can’t help waiting
