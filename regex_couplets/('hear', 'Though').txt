('hear', 'though')

You can hear it also through your leisure
though it was most emphatically that

and my heart rate
I had nightmares though

I hear it between bills and stuff
though not many freeze up

as far back as my history heard
though not many facts up in the sky

I can hear them between bills and stuff
though as for conversing

but I can hear them
though in not many acts up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
though it is not a simple act

You can hear it also through static leisure
I thought

In my heart did I lose trust
though we are waiting for her
