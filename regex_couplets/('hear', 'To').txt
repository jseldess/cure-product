('hear', 'To')

You can hear it also through your leisure
To my children Walt Whitman

and my heart rate
To that impossible place

I hear it between bills and stuff
Tomorrow

I can hear it between bills and stuff
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

In my heart did I lose trust
To the ends of transactions
