('hear', 'You')

You can hear it also through your leisure
You use the most essential parts

I hear it between bills and stuff
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

You can hear it also through static leisure
You can clear it also through static leisure

as far back as my history heard
You need history

In my heart did I lose trust
You can have seen offering
