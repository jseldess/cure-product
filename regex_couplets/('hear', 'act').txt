('hear', 'act')

You can hear it also through your leisure
I was enjoined to act again myself

and my heart rate
I was enjoined to act again

I hear it between bills and stuff
and strategies not tactics

I can hear it between bills and stuff
actually considering the end

as far back as my history heard
I refuse indelible tracts

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I refuse indelible contracts

but I can hear them
Though in not many acts

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
though in not many acts up in the sky

You can hear it also through static leisure
we had inhabited actually

In my heart did I lose trust
To the ends of transactions
