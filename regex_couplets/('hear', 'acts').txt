('hear', 'acts')

You can hear it also through your leisure
I refuse indelible tracts

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I refuse indelible contracts

as far back as my history heard
though not many facts up in the sky

but I can hear them
Though in not many acts

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
though in not many acts up in the sky

You can hear it also through static leisure
