('hear', 'any')

You can hear it also through your leisure
at any time it can drift again

and my heart rate
Or the company

Spinning around the heart
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I hear it between bills and stuff
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I can hear it between bills and stuff
there wasn’t any television 

that I can hear
not many face up

as far back as my history heard
though not many facts up in the sky

I can hear them between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
Though in not many acts

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
though in not many acts up in the sky

You can hear it also through static leisure
I walk up and don’t work anymore

In my heart did I lose trust
The many transparent pixel calls
