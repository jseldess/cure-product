('hear', 'bills')

You can hear it also through your leisure
I hear it between bills and stuff

I can hear it between bills and stuff
I can hear them between bills and stuff

that I can hear
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

there was no television to hear
I cannot hear it between bills

You can hear it also through static leisure
between bills and stuffed animals
