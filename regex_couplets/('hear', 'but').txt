('hear', 'but')

You can hear it also through your leisure
Attributable or

and my heart rate
but the sun isnâ€™t up

I hear it between bills and stuff
but it continued

I can hear it between bills and stuff
but would I love her the same

that I can hear
but they are black spots

as far back as my history heard
but I can hear them

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
I resume attributable visions

You can hear it also through static leisure
but where is it

In my heart did I lose trust
that decisions can be attributable
