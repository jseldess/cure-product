('hear', 'clear')

You can hear it also through your leisure
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I cannot clear it also through investiture

but I can hear them
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

You can hear it also through static leisure
You can clear it also through static leisure

as far back as my history heard
