('hear', 'could')

You can hear it also through your leisure
and could be mapped and weighed

I hear it between bills and stuff
until I could not tire 

I can hear them between bills and stuff
until I could not be tired

as far back as my history heard
until I could not be hired

In my heart did I lose trust
and could be inflected with reasons
