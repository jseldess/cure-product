('hear', 'count')

You can hear it also through your leisure
Then I constellate my time family country

and my heart rate
I brought my count down

I hear it between bills and stuff
without the long time I was accounting

I can hear it between bills and stuff
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can hear it also through static leisure
So I constellate the time family country

In my heart did I lose trust
