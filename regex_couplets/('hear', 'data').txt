('hear', 'data')

You can hear it also through your leisure
I’ll pull my data higher up

and my heart rate
I’ll pull my data

I hear it between bills and stuff
The days of private data

I can hear it between bills and stuff
trackers collecting data on users

In my heart did I lose trust
my interfaced stand data
