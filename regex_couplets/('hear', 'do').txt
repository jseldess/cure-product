('hear', 'do')

You can hear it also through your leisure
The dogs and lillies

and my heart rate
I brought my head down

and my heartrate
which I brought down with qualities

I hear it between bills and stuff
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

I can hear it between bills and stuff
What I do in my liesure

that I can hear
I walk up and don’t work anymore

In my heart did I lose trust
and it doesn’t take long
