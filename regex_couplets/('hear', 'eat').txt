('hear', 'eat')

You can hear it also through your leisure
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

and my heart rate
Where I put it beating

Spinning around the heart
executive breath

I hear it between bills and stuff
of the habits they create.

I can hear it between bills and stuff
it was not just a defeat

In my heart did I lose trust
for the creation of the universe
