('hear', 'fall')

You can hear it also through your leisure
and not falling at all

and my heart rate
Then fall then summer

and my heartrate
Face falling off the edge of the face

I hear it between bills and stuff
falling off the encoded end

I can hear it between bills and stuff
I take it out in the snow fall

that I can hear
The first falling syllable

as far back as my history heard
falling off the end of the world

that I hear without trying
falling off the end

I can hear them between bills and stuff
