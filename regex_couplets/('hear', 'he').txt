('hear', 'he')

You can hear it also through your leisure
The dogs and lillies

and my heart rate
Then I cannot see face value

and my heartrate
Out of the back page ruins

Spinning around the heart
Where I put it beating

I hear it between bills and stuff
off the edge of the world

I can hear it between bills and stuff
The ads in mine

that I can hear
falling off the encoded end

as far back as my history heard
What was the last time

I can hear them between bills and stuff
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

that I hear without trying
The first language

but I can hear them
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
I cannot hear it between bills

You can hear it also through static leisure
The long time I had a vision

In my heart did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me
