('hear', 'head')

You can hear it also through your leisure
Without a head

and my heart rate
with my head

and my heartrate
I search with my head

I hear it between bills and stuff
into the next level head

I can hear it between bills and stuff
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

In my heart did I lose trust
