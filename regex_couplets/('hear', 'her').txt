('hear', 'her')

You can hear it also through your leisure
I’ll get there eventually

and my heart rate
Where official policy is to catch and release

and my heartrate
Where I put it beating

Spinning around the heart
higher up in the results

I hear it between bills and stuff
I’ll pull myself higher up

I can hear it between bills and stuff
but would I love her the same

that I can hear
Where I take my liesure

that I hear without trying
On the other hand

as far back as my history heard
there was no television to hear

I cannot hear it between bills
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

In my heart did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me
