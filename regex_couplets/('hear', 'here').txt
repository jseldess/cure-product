('hear', 'here')

You can hear it also through your leisure
I’ll get there eventually

and my heart rate
Where official policy is to catch and release

and my heartrate
Where I put it beating

Spinning around the heart
I’ll get there ruins

I hear it between bills and stuff
there was no promotion

I can hear it between bills and stuff
Where I take my liesure

that I can hear
there was no television to hear

I cannot hear it between bills
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

as far back as my history heard
but where is it

In my heart did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me
