('hear', 'high')

You can hear it also through your leisure
way high up in the inter

and my heart rate
higher up in the results

I hear it between bills and stuff
Iâ€™ll pull myself higher up

I can hear it between bills and stuff
The sun high enough to enter directly 

In my heart did I lose trust
The sun high enough to strike directly
