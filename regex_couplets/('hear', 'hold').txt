('hear', 'hold')

You can hear it also through your leisure
I take hold of my finger

and my heart rate
When they really take hold of my finger

I hear it between bills and stuff
Since I had to hold the entire company

I can hear it between bills and stuff
and hold and wish to hold

In my heart did I lose trust
