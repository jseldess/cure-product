('hear', 'if')

You can hear it also through your leisure
drifting away needs others presume desires

and my heart rate
out of the fifth page ruins

I hear it between bills and stuff
learned without too much difficulty to code

I can hear it between bills and stuff
If I take a different measure

that I can hear
If I take some different measure

as far back as my history heard
if there is anything 

In my heart did I lose trust
if only on the way to the trash
