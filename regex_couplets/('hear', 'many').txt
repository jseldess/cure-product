('hear', 'many')

You can hear it also through your leisure
not many face up

as far back as my history heard
though not many facts up in the sky

I can hear them between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
Though in not many acts

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
though in not many acts up in the sky

You can hear it also through static leisure
They have very many choices

In my heart did I lose trust
The many transparent pixel calls
