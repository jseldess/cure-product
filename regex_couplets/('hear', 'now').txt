('hear', 'now')

You can hear it also through your leisure
Right now I’m the cart

and my heart rate
out in the snow

I hear it between bills and stuff
I take it out in the snow fall

I can hear it between bills and stuff
I even know what I would find

that I can hear
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

as far back as my history heard
even when close to my knowing

In my heart did I lose trust
who knows how to turn it off
