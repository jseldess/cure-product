('hear', 'over')

You can hear it also through your leisure
over the long time up in the sky

and my heart rate
hovering above standing water

I hear it between bills and stuff
over the time line I was on

I can hear it between bills and stuff
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

In my heart did I lose trust
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
