('hear', 'pleasure')

You can hear it also through your leisure
Which is a pleasure to never live out

and my heart rate
there was no walking along the pleasure

I can hear it between bills and stuff
up in the television pleasure

as far back as my history heard
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I can hear them between bills and stuff
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

You can hear it also through static leisure
