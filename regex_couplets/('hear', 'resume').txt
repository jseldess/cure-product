('hear', 'resume')

You can hear it also through your leisure
and canâ€™t presume to need

and my heart rate
I resume unassimilable visions

I can hear it between bills and stuff
I resume indelible tracks

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

but I can hear them
I resume attributable visions

as far back as my history heard
I continue to presume

In my heart did I lose trust
I presume to others
