('hear', 'ring')

You can hear it also through your leisure
bring your child along

and my heart rate
hovering above standing water

I hear it between bills and stuff
actually considering the end

as far back as my history heard
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can hear it also through static leisure
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

In my heart did I lose trust
firing and connecting somewhere
