('hear', 'set')

You can hear it also through your leisure
upset by Gingrich

and my heart rate
in front of the set afternoon

I hear it between bills and stuff
in front of the set of regulations

I can hear it between bills and stuff
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

In my heart did I lose trust
presets
