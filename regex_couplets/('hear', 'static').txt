('hear', 'static')

You can hear it also through your leisure
wrapped in static and explicit statements

I can hear them between bills and stuff
wrapped in static implicit statements

but I can hear them
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

You can hear it also through static leisure
You can clear it also through static leisure

as far back as my history heard
wrapped in static

In my heart did I lose trust
