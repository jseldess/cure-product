('hear', 'stuff')

You can hear it also through your leisure
I hear it between bills and stuff

I can hear it between bills and stuff
Would I love the same stuff

that I can hear
I can hear them between bills and stuff

that I hear without trying
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

there was no television to hear
and stuff up in the sky

You can hear it also through static leisure
between bills and stuffed animals
