('hear', 'tell')

You can hear it also through your leisure
Then I constellate my time family country

and my heart rate
The CEO tells me to embody values

Spinning around the heart
I had to tell them the news

I hear it between bills and stuff
So I constellate the time family country

In my heart did I lose trust
