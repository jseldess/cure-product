('hear', 'track')

You can hear it also through your leisure
I reuse indelible tracks 

I can hear it between bills and stuff
The first track

that I can hear
I refuse indelible tracks

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I resume indelible tracks

but I can hear them
in not many tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
and other types of tracking technology

In my heart did I lose trust
which as tracked befitted
