('hear', 'up?')

You can hear it also through your leisure
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

and my heart rate
Then I cannot see face value

and my heartrate
of later results

Spinning around the heart
Where I put it beating

I hear it between bills and stuff
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I can hear it between bills and stuff
Running above broadway

that I can hear
white spots on a black surface

as far back as my history heard
I reuse indelible tracks

I can hear them between bills and stuff
black spots on a white surface

that I hear without trying
The first language

but I can hear them
I resume unassimilable visions

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I cannot hear it between bills
and stuff up in the sky

You can hear it also through static leisure
You can clear it also through static leisure

In my heart did I lose trust
In what part did I lose trust
