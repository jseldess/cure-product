('hear', 'us')

You can hear it also through your leisure
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

and my heart rate
In a vertiginous dream

and my heartrate
You use the most essential parts

I hear it between bills and stuff
The ventillation rushes on

I can hear it between bills and stuff
I reuse unassimilable visions

that I can hear
I reuse indelible tracks

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I refuse indelible tracts

as far back as my history heard
I want to cite a poem so usual

In my heart did I lose trust
In what part did I lose trust
