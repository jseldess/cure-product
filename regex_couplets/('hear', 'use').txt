('hear', 'use')

You can hear it also through your leisure
You use the most essential parts

I hear it between bills and stuff
I reuse unassimilable visions

I can hear it between bills and stuff
because there was no solid ground to continue along

that I can hear
I reuse indelible tracks

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I refuse indelible tracts

as far back as my history heard
I used my technology

In my heart did I lose trust
