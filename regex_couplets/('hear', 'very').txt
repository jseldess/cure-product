('hear', 'very')

You can hear it also through your leisure
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I hear it between bills and stuff
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I can hear it between bills and stuff
They have very many choices

In my heart did I lose trust
