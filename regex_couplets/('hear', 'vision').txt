('hear', 'vision')

You can hear it also through your leisure
I had me a vision

I hear it between bills and stuff
The planning process for visions

I can hear it between bills and stuff
I reuse unassimilable visions

that I can hear
I resume unassimilable visions

as far back as my history heard
The long time I had a vision

I can hear them between bills and stuff
up in the television pleasure

but I can hear them
there was no television to hear

I cannot hear it between bills
I resume attributable visions

You can hear it also through static leisure
The long time I was a vision

In my heart did I lose trust
joined in my television
