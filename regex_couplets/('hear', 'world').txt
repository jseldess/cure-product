('hear', 'world')

You can hear it also through your leisure
off the edge of the world

and my heart rate
off the end of the world

I hear it between bills and stuff
hauling off the end of the world

I can hear it between bills and stuff
falling off the end of the world

that I can hear
the opinions in my world

In my heart did I lose trust
