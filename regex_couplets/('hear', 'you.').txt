('hear', 'you.')

You can hear it also through your leisure
bring your child along

and my heart rate
That you can see only the back of

I hear it between bills and stuff
since you can imagine movement

I can hear it between bills and stuff
where you can earn more 

that I can hear
If you have confidence regardless all else

In my heart did I lose trust
the young ripples inaudibly
