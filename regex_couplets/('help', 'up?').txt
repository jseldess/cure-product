('help', 'up?')

people would be helped
The trackers on users

The constituents would be helped
for my own purchases

all parties would be helped
all parties would be held

in the form help sale offered
In my heart did I lose trust

Bach helps turn it off
Though we are waiting for her

Selma helps too
Though we can’t help waiting

Though we can’t help waiting for her
My daughter helps too
