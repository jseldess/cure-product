('her', 'break')

Where I sleep at times
though we are still breaking in

Though we are waiting for her
though we are breaking in the space that it had

where I send and relive would be held
Though we are breaking 

where I send and relive aside
without really breaking

where I send and relive
would only willingly break

Where in me did I host
