('her', 'Bach')

Where I sleep at times
I end up in Bach 

though we are waiting for her
I end up in Bach and Selma

with her way
I end up Bach

with her ways to the ends
Bach helps turn it off

with her way to the ends
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

to the other end of actions
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

to their other end
and end up in Bach

There are no constant ways
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

There are constant ways
I end up Bach forty-one seconds in

with constant ways to the other end
I end up in Bach with no way 

to the other end of transactions
on Bach

on the other end
