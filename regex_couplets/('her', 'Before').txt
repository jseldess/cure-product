('her', 'Before')

Where I sleep at times
Before we walk across the wide field

I’ll get there eventually
Before we walk across the wide opening

Of course there is a direction
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

One day there is direction
Before morning goals

there was no promotion
