('her', 'For')

Where I sleep at times
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Forecasting the story before dawn

I’ll pull myself higher up
For an ungraspable time

We had to say goodbye there
For an ungraspable purchase

 of those gathered
For Mitt Romney

To neither study
For my own purchases

where I send and relive aside
Formerly a way like this one

to the other end
Formerly away there are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

There are constant ways
Forty-one seconds in

to the other end of actions
For a while I think I don’t listen

traffick is there nonetheless
