('her', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

Where I sleep at times
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

I told her a story, she drew waves.
I’m simply inside

One day there is direction
Right now I’m the cart

I’ll get there eventually
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

there was no promotion
where I’m watching my tv

where I am aside
