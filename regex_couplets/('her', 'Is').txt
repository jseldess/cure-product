('her', 'Is')

Where I sleep at times
Why isnâ€™t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

I told her a story, she drew waves.
Is the weight of my purchases

Where I need gravity
Is the weight of my click or zipcode

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
Is there a baby and a bear

Though we are waiting for her
