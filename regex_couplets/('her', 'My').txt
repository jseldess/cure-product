('her', 'My')

Where I sleep at times
My live connections to you

Whereas direction is beside the point
My associations

There was very little physical activity
My purpose up in the sky

We had to say goodbye there
My means without gravity

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
My daughter with her way

Though we are waiting for her
My daughter helps too

to the other end
My say to the elections

Cereal and othersâ€™ health
My interesting politics

I learned the point where I am
My state kept loaned impression

where the tongue rippled
My void

The prospects there already
