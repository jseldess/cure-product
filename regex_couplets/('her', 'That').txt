('her', 'That')

Where I sleep at times
That’s exaclty what I want for them

One day there is direction
That is itself not still

The edge isn’t even there
That’s where I sleep at times

others desires
That’s when they really take

I’ll get there eventually
That you can see only the back of

there was no promotion
That company creates a life

that potential is there for you
That I captured an afterimage

without any further damage
That are my right to say

Cereal and others’ health
