('her', 'There')

Where I sleep at times
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Of course there is a direction
There are quarterly goals

There are performance reviews
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I’ll get there eventually
There was very little physical activity

that potential is there for you
There are spots waiting

or in some imaginary elsewhere
There are constant ways

The other end of means
There are no constant waves

The other ends of my transactions
There are no constant ways

The other end of my transactions
