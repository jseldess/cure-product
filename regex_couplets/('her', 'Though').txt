('her', 'though')

Where I sleep at times
As though stationary and a destination

The edge isn’t even there
And put in place as though stationary

Though there are quarters goals
though there are quarters with goals

with goals I find there
though it was most emphatically that

To neither study
I had nightmares though

There was very little physical activity
though not many freeze up

there was no television to hear
though in not many acts up in the sky

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I thought

Where in me did I host
though we are still breaking in

Though we are waiting for her
though we are breaking in the space that it had

where I send and relive would be held
after though there’s no memory

Where in me did I loose
I answered what I thought

where rights ended themselves
I answered what I thought about

where lights blended themselves
