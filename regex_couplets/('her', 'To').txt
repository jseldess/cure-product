('her', 'To')

Where I sleep at times
To my children Walt Whitman

others desires
To my chidren

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

I’ll get there eventually
To neither study

Where official policy is to catch and release
To that impossible place

Higher up in the results
Tomorrow

there was no promotion
Toward the start informally given my reasons

but where is it
To substitute neither study

Please neither study
To the ends of transactions

though we are waiting for her
To the ends of my transactions

to the other end
To the other end of transactions

There are no constant ways
To the other end of my actions

To the other end of transactions like this
To the other end of means like this one

Like this one the other end of means
To the right of determined elections

I learned the point where I am
