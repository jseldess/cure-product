('her', 'We')

Where I sleep at times
We’ll have coffee this morning

Whereas direction is beside the point
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

I told her a story, she drew waves.
We can wrestle them with their goals

We can rest there in them with their goals
We had to say goodbye there

We had to buy there
We had inhabited actually

Where in me did I host
We got paid one way by a voice

Please neither study
We ask say in that case

The prospects there already
