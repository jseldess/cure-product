('her', 'You')

Where I sleep at times
You should ask who I am

Whereas direction is beside the point
You can hear it also through your leisure

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
You use the most essential parts

higher up in the results
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
You need history

I get through there
You can have seen offering

I assume possession to others
