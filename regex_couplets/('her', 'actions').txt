('her', 'actions')

Where I sleep at times
conversations with our reactions

Of course there is a direction
to the ends of my transactions

Where in me did I host
The ends of my transactions

where I send and relive
To the ends of transactions

though we are waiting for her
to the ends of actions

with her waves
the other end transactions

with her ways to the ends
to the other end of actions

to the other end battery dawn 
of my actions

There are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

to their other end
The other ends of my transactions

There are no constant ways
The other end of my transactions

To the other end of transactions
To the other end of my actions

To the other end of transactions like this
the other end of actions

The other end of means
Like this one other end of transactions

To the other end of means like this one
actions

to the other end
