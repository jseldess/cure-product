('her', 'agreed')

Where I sleep at times
and to which I’ve agreed

Though we are waiting for her
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

where I send and relive would be held
and for which the plan agreed

Where in me did I host
that agreed one of rest

Elsewhere by my memory
and to which the plan agreed

there wasn’t any television 
that agreed home

The prospects there already
that agreed to one the people

The offers there already
