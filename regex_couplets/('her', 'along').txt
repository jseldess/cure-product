('her', 'along')

Where I sleep at times
bring your child along

I’ll pull myself another personality type
The days lined along company

that potential is there for you
there was no walking along the pleasure

there was no promotion
there was no walking along

where you can earn more 
and continue along having 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
walking along the measure

there wasn’t any television 
formerly along time they were on

I presume to others
formerly along my say to the elections

where rights ended themselves
drawn formerly along 

By my memory elsewhere
along cables

where I am aside increased
mostly along cables

where I am aside
shone formerly along time

where lights blended themselves
formerly along the time they were on

Cereal and others’ health
