('her', 'also')

Where I sleep at times
You can hear it also through your leisure

I’ll get there eventually
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

On the other hand
I cannot clear it also through investiture

there was no television to hear
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
also didn’t really move

By my memory elsewhere
