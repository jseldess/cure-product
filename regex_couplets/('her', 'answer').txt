('her', 'answer')

Where I sleep at times
for the duration of the answer

the point where I am
answered about 

where I send and relive
the duration of answers

where I end and relive
for the duration of answers

where I blend and relive
by the sight of the hosting answered about

Where in me did I loose
I answered about

By my memory elsewhere
washed I answered about

after though thereâ€™s no memory
I answered what I thought

where rights ended themselves
at least for the duration of the answer

where I am aside at least
I answered while interfaced

but for memory elsewhere
I answered what I thought about

where lights blended themselves
