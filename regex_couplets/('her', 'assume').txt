('her', 'assume')

Where I sleep at times
I assumed it was visible

Whereas direction is beside the point
I assumed 

if there is anything 
I assumed what I draw

I presume to others
I assume the offers reliable

The prospects there already
I assume the offers revisitable

I assume possession to others
I assume the offers divisible

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
