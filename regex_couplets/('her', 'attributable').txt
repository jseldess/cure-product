('her', 'attributable')

Where I sleep at times
I resume attributable visions

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
attributable visions

I get through there
that decisions can be attributable

with her waves
decisions that can be attributable

The prospects there already
revisions that can be attributable

The offers there already
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I presume to others
in that decisions can be attributable

I assume possession to others
