('her', 'away')

Where I sleep at times
drifting away

I told her a story, she drew waves.
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I canâ€™t presume to need others
drifting away needs

There are quarterly goals
drifting away from the task

others desires
Who throws contours away

to the other end
Formerly away there are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
formerly away

with constant ways to the other end
