('her', 'been')

Where I sleep at times
It has been since

here described
After having been contented

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
that having been after content

there was no promotion
having been graspable

I get through there
having been an ungraspable time

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
having been purchased out

And we had to say goodbye to her there
Having been purchased out of you

where I need gravity
