('her', 'bill')

Where I sleep at times
between bills and stuffed animals

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I hear it between bills and stuff

I’ll pull myself higher up
I can hear it between bills and stuff

but would I love her the same
I can hear them between bills and stuff

Where I take my liesure
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

there was no television to hear
I cannot hear it between bills

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
billowing in the cloud

I get through there
until the bill came

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
the bill my detuning 

I learned the point where I am
bills and stuffed animals

The prospects there already
