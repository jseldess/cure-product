('her', 'blend')

Where I sleep at times
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Of course there is a direction
walking into percents blending themselves

I get through there
where I blend and relive

Where in me did I host
where lights blended themselves

where rights ended themselves
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

Cereal and othersâ€™ health
