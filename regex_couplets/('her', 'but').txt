('her', 'but')

Where I sleep at times
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

I told her a story, she drew waves.
but not impart cynicism

others desires
I want but not to impart cynicism

I’ll get there eventually
Attributable or

Where official policy is to catch and release
but the sun isn’t up

there was no promotion
but it continued

There was very little physical activity
but it continued rippling muscle

that potential is there for you
but would I love her the same

Where I take my liesure
but they are black spots

On the other hand
but I can hear them

there was no television to hear
I resume attributable visions

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
but where is it

I get through there
attributable visions

I get from here through there
that decisions can be attributable

with her waves
but for memory elsewhere

in memory persisting elsewhere
but standing in memory

where rights ended themselves
decisions that can be attributable

The prospects there already
revisions that can be attributable

The offers there already
but I own all that’s messageable

traffick is there nonetheless
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I presume to others
in that decisions can be attributable

I assume possession to others
