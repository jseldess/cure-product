('her', 'came')

Where I sleep at times
I invited most of what came next

There was very little physical activity
I came back to me

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
I came after my past

in traversing get through there
until the bill came

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
and came home to rewind inflections

The prospects there already
and came home to rewind

I presume to others
