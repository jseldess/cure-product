('her', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

Where I sleep at times
I can’t fix them without direction

there are quarters 
and can’t presume to need

others desires
Then I can’t presume to need others

If I let myself see others desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
But I can’t let myself treat 

I’ll pull myself another personality type
But I can’t let myself disregard

Others desires as legitimate
That can’t be glimpsed

there was no promotion
Though we can’t help waiting

with her way to the ends
Though we can’t help waiting for her

with her way
I can’t remember them

where the tongue rippled
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

I presume to others
