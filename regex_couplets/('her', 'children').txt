('her', 'children')

Where I sleep at times
On a snow day with my children

I’ll get there eventually
as pure as my children

I told her a story, she drew waves.
my children’s consumption

Of course there is a direction
only fragments of time with my children

on a day there will be direction
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

others desires
To my children Walt Whitman

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Even the children

We had to say goodbye there
my possession of my children

I presume to others
speech my possession of my children

with her waves
