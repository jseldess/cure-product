('her', 'company')

Where I sleep at times
Or the company

Where I put it beating
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

there was no promotion
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

There was very little physical activity
The days aligned for company

that potential is there for you
That company creates a life

but would I love her the same
