('her', 'constant')

Where I sleep at times
with constant ways 

to the other end
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

to the other end of actions
who throws a constant way

There are constant ways
Formerly away there are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
with no constant way

to their other end
with no constant ways 

who know the ways to their other end
with no constant waves

There are no constant waves
There are no constant ways

The other end of my transactions
with constant ways to the other end

to the other end of transactions
