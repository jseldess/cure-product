('her', 'continue')

Where I sleep at times
but it continued

there was no promotion
but it continued rippling muscle

that potential is there for you
no solid ground to continue along

there was no walking along
and continue along having 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
I continue to presume

I get through there
I continue to subsume

I get from here through there
I continue to consume

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
Then I continue to dream then

And we had to say goodbye to her there
I continued to dream then

where I need gravity
