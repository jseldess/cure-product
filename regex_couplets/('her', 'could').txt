('her', 'could')

Where I sleep at times
and could be mapped and weighed

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

higher up in the results
until I could not tire 

there was no television to hear
until I could not be tired

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
until I could not be hired

I get through there
I could in effect credit

I get from here through there
I could consume the dream

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
and we could inhabit the room easy

Though we are waiting for her
and could be inflected with reasons

The prospects there already
