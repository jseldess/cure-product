('her', 'damage')

Where I sleep at times
without ensuing damage

in traversing get through there
while consuming damage

where I need gravity
without consumer damage

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
without longer damage

without any further damage
to any consumer damage

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
