('her', 'data')

Where I sleep at times
I’ll pull my data higher up

higher up in the internet
I’ll pull my data

I’ll pull myself higher up
The days of private data

that potential is there for you
The days of public data

There was very little physical activity
trackers collecting data on users

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
my interfaced stand data

By my memory elsewhere
my standing in data

but for memory elsewhere
