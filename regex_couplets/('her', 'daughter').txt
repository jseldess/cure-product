('her', 'daughter')

Where I sleep at times
I love my daughter still

but would I love her the same
with my daughter

though we are waiting for her
my daughter will learn 

with her waves
My daughter with her way

with her way
My daughter helps too

to the other end
my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me

By my memory elsewhere
