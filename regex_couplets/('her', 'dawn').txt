('her', 'dawn')

Where I sleep at times
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Of course there is a direction
Forecasting the story before dawn

Iâ€™ll pull myself higher up
dawn already formerly nights 

if there is anything 
dawn formerly

where I am aside at least
with dawn already formerly nights 

Though we are waiting for her
battery dawn nights 

to the other end of actions
to the other end battery dawn 

the other end transactions
battery dawn 

to the other end
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

to their other end
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

where rights ended themselves
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in memory elsewhere
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

where lights blended themselves
