('her', 'day')

Where I sleep at times
On a snow day with my children

I’ll get there eventually
One day there is direction

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
on a day there will be direction

Though there are quarters goals
Actually one day there is direction

The edge isn’t even there
I argued the days felt longer

there was no promotion
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

There was very little physical activity
I argued that the days were longer

that potential is there for you
The days are long

but would I love her the same
The day

Though we are waiting for her
between that day

Where in me did I host
I have a memory between the day

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
at least most days

where I am aside
