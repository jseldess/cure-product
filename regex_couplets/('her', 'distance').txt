('her', 'distance')

Where I sleep at times
Falling from this distance

Of course there is a direction
A person from a distance

Where I put it beating
And from a weak distance

where I need gravity
And from that great distance

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
And from a great distance

There are spots waiting
