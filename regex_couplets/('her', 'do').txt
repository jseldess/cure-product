('her', 'do')

Where I sleep at times
The dogs and lillies

Whereas direction is beside the point
in a sharp downward turn 

I told her a story, she drew waves.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

Of course there is a direction
does not feel an exception

others desires
drifting does not feel an exception

I’ll get there eventually
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I’ll pull myself another personality type
to the down arrow

That’s where I sleep at times
the down arrow

Others desires as legitimate
I brought my head down

Where official policy is to catch and release
I brought my qualities down

Where I put it beating
which I brought down with qualities

higher up in the results
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

there was no promotion
What I do in my liesure

Where I take my liesure
Undoubtedly 

But would I love her the same
I walk up and don’t work anymore

but where is it
here is the site of the battle of maldon

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

where I need gravity
around the dogs and lillies

Where I lead gravity
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

One was up where it should be down
and it doesn’t take long

where I send and retrieve relive
latency which doesn’t mean anything

Where in me did I host
I only think I don’t listen

traffick is there nonetheless
