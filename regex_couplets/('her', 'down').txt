('her', 'down')

Where I sleep at times
in a sharp downward turn 

I told her a story, she drew waves.
In a sharp downard turn

Of course there is a direction
to the down arrow

That’s where I sleep at times
the down arrow

others desires
I brought my head down

I’ll get there eventually
I brought my qualities down

Where official policy is to catch and release
which I brought down with qualities

higher up in the results
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

One was up where it should be down
