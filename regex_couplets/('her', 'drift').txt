('her', 'drift')

Where I sleep at times
drifting away

I told her a story, she drew waves.
drifting does not feel an exception

others desires
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
at any time it can drift again

I’ll pull myself another personality type
drifting away needs

There are quarterly goals
drifting away from the task

Others desires as legitimate
