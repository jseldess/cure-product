('her', 'eat')

Where I sleep at times
too sunny to eat ice cream

Of course there is a direction
I reach repeated expressions first

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
But I can’t let myself treat 

others desires
Then I can’t presume to treat others

I’ll pull myself another personality type
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

here described
I let myself treat

That’s where I sleep at times
executive breath

I’ll get there eventually
execute breath

I’ll pull my data higher up
was not just a defeat

Where official policy is to catch and release
Where I put it beating

higher up in the results
of the habits I create

there was no promotion
of the habits they create.

There was very little physical activity
That company creates a life

that potential is there for you
it was not just a defeat

but where is it
And from that great distance

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
And from a great distance

There are spots waiting
for the creation of the universe

the point where I am
burrowed about from repeated travels

where I send and relive
from cables reheated travels

where I stand and retrieve and relive
