('her', 'elections')

Where I sleep at times
on my way to elections

I presume to others
formerly my way to the elections

where rights ended themselves
on a way to the elections

By my memory elsewhere
formally a way to the elections

Cereal and othersâ€™ health
I stay the right of my elections

I learned the point where I am
