('her', 'else')

Where I sleep at times
If you have confidence regardless all else

To neither study
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

there wasn’t any television 
and elsewhere my memory

and other types of tracking technology
and elsewhere my memory of you

where I send and relive aside
elsewhere my purposes

Though we are waiting for her
elsewhere by my memory

Where in me did I loose
By my memory elsewhere

after though there’s no memory
in memory elsewhere

but for memory elsewhere
in memory persisting elsewhere

where rights ended themselves
