('her', 'entered')

Where I sleep at times
I have entered my phone

Of course there is a direction
I have entered my purposes

and elsewhere my memory of you
I have entered my purchases

where I send and relive aside
entered into my purposes

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
I had entered my phone

By my memory elsewhere
