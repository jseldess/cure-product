('her', 'fall')

Where I sleep at times
Then fall then summer from my face

Of course there is a direction
Then fall then summer

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
and not falling at all

I’ll get there eventually
Face falling off the edge of the face

I’ll pull myself another personality type
The value falling off the edge of the face

I’ll pull my data higher up
The value falling off the edge of th face

there was no promotion
falling off the encoded end

but would I love her the same
I take it out in the snow fall

there was no walking along the pleasure
falling off the end

Where I take my liesure
falling off the end of the world

On the other hand
