('her', 'feel')

Where I sleep at times
conversations with our feelings

Of course there is a direction
conversation with our feelings

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
does not feel an exception

others desires
drifting does not feel an exception

I’ll get there eventually
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I tried to feel the key values extending 

there was no promotion
I tried to feel the extension of key values

There was very little physical activity
What would I feel without that goal

But would I love her the same
But my not feeling the memory aside

where I send and relive aside
But my not feeling the memory inside

where I send and relive
which feels most comfortable

Where in me did I host
which feels more comfortable

if there is anything 
which is what feels most comfortable

Where in me did I lose
which I feel formerly about for

after though there’s no memory
By my feeling the memory inside

There are constant ways
But my feeling the memory aside

firing and connecting somewhere
