('her', 'form')

Where I sleep at times
There are performance reviews

here described
Toward the start informally given my reasons

but where is it
already formerly a long time

Where in me did I host
in the form filled offered in trust

Elsewhere by my memory
dawn already formerly nights 

if there is anything 
A way formerly like this one

where I send and relive would be held
already formely a long time

where I send and relive aside
dawn formerly

where I am aside at least
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

where I send and retrieve relive
with dawn already formerly nights 

Though we are waiting for her
formerly a long time they were on

I presume to others
in the form filled offered trust

Where in me did I loose
which I feel formerly about for

after though there’s no memory
in the form filled offered must

Where in me pre-worn
in the form filled offered

Where did I lose trust in me
formerly along time they were on

with her waves
formerly a way

to the other end of actions
formerly a way like this one

to the other end
formerly away

with constant ways to the other end
formerly my way 

where rights ended themselves
drawn formerly a long time

By my memory elsewhere
addition were filters formerly

where lights blended themselves
drawn formerly along 

Cereal and others’ health
own best form

The prospects there already
own best form to ourselves

The offers there already
