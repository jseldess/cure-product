('her', 'front')

Where I sleep at times
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Of course there is a direction
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

there was no promotion
in front of the set of regulations

There was very little physical activity
And need out in front purchase

We had to say goodbye there
And read out in front

 of those gathered
behind or out front or up above

I learned the point where I am
