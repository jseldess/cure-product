('her', 'full')

Where I sleep at times
It keeps coming down thankfully

Of course there is a direction
I am full of potential

There was very little physical activity
with full potential to movement

that potential is there for you
full of aspirations

there was no promotion
full of the missing words

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
still carefully

Where in me pre-worn
