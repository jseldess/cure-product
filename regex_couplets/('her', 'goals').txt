('her', 'goals')

Where I sleep at times
Though there are quarters goals

Actually one day there is direction
We can wrestle them with their goals

We can rest there in them with their goals
with goals

though there are quarters with goals
with goals I find there

what I find there
and without quartely goals

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
There are quarterly goals

There are performance reviews
before morning goals

there was no promotion
