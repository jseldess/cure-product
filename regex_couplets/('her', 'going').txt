('her', 'going')

Where I sleep at times
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

I told her a story, she drew waves.
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

Where I take my liesure
The way that she is going

where I send and relive would be held
The way that I am going

My daughter with her way
The way that I was going

Though we are waiting for her
way I was going 

with constant ways to the other end
A way I was going

to the other end of actions
