('her', 'graspable')

Where I sleep at times
having been graspable

I get through there
having been an ungraspable time

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
for an ungraspable purchase

We had to say goodbye there
For an ungraspable time

We had to buy there
And for an ungraspable time

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
