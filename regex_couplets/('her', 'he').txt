('her', 'he')

Where I sleep at times
But that is beside the point

Whereas direction is beside the point
The dogs and lillies

The prospects there already
by the private preambles

I’ll pull myself another personality type
off the edge of the world

I’ll get there eventually
Then I constellate my time family country

I told her a story, she drew waves.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

Of course there is a direction
When I want something

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
All of the time

One day there is direction
Then fall then summer

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
into the stream of pictures

on a day there will be direction
interjecting into the stream

Though there are quarters goals
They’re just not mine

Actually one day there is direction
The edge is put in place

The edge isn’t even there
Rather it itself is rotating

there are quarters 
We can wrestle them with their goals

We can rest there in them with their goals
I step off the edge

though there are quarters with goals
with goals I find there

what I find there
others desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
In the right sense

There are quarterly goals
There are performance reviews

here described
the latter

That’s where I sleep at times
to the pillow

Others desires as legitimate
Then I cannot see face value

I’ll pull my data higher up
higher up in the internet

I’ll pull myself higher up
high up in the internet

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
You can hear it also through your leisure

To neither study
The South Carolina primary 

Where official policy is to catch and release
A turtle fished out of the lake

Where I put it beating
Out of the remnants 

higher up in the results
rewind before the sun

I’ll get there ruins
Then the sun isn’t up 

where I can lay claim to ruins
high up in the architecture

where I can claim to see the ruins
from where I can claim

from where I can claim to see the mosquitos
to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water

there was no promotion
And as an extension of the values

There was very little physical activity
aside from the retinas

that potential is there for you
The days are long

but would I love her the same
talking into pheasants bending themselves

Where I take my liesure
I take it out in the snow fall

there was no walking along the pleasure
there was no walking along

where you can earn more 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

there wasn’t any television 
– The Pixies

On the other hand
I need the work

there was no television to hear
I cannot hear it between bills

but where is it
Then I saw into you

I get through there
in the sense of watching

I get from here through there
I get here through there

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
under the last seen principle

in traversing get through there
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

get from here through there
even when close to my knowing

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
here is the site of the battle of maldon

And we had to say goodbye to her there
she lay under the grass

of those gathered
Up in the sky

We had to say goodbye there
under the grasp principle

We had to buy there
Under the grass principle

where I need gravity
they can be waived

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
While we’re up in the sky 

Where I lead gravity
I continued to dream then

There are spots waiting
until I purchase up in the sky

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
They can be weighed

One was up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes

I tell you where I need gravity
Is the weight of my purchases

without any further damage
until the bill came

Though we are waiting for her
to the ends of my transactions

Where in me did I host
in the form filled offered in trust

Elsewhere by my memory
washed by my memory

if there is anything 
I have a memory between the day

Where I host my purposes
and elsewhere my memory

and other types of tracking technology
To substitute neither study

Please neither study
and elsewhere my memory of you

where I send and relive aside
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

where I stand and relive
the impulse for my own prospects

where I end
where I send and retrieve aside

where I stand aside
the impulse to my purpose

where I stand and retrieve
aside the impulse to my purpose

where I stand aside and retrieve
where I stand and retrieve relive

Elsewhere my memory
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

elsewhere my purposes
washed my purchases

where I send and relive would be held
All parties would be held for my own purchases

Where in me did I last
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

where I send and relive
But my not feeling the memory inside

where I am aside at least
for the duration of the answer

the point where I am
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

where I send and retrieve relive
from cables reheated travels

where I stand and retrieve and relive
where I am aside

where I end and relive
the duration of answers

firing and connecting somewhere
where I send and receive

where I blend and relive
The ends of my transactions

I presume to others
speak them of my possessions

Where in me did I lose
about the site

Where in me did I loose
in the form filled offered trust

where in me pre-worn
pre-worn and still wash them

By my memory elsewhere
washed I answered about

after though there’s no memory
so still washed

Where in me did I lose trust
in the form filled offered

Where did I lose trust in me
Where did we lose trust

with her waves
to the ends of actions

My daughter with her way
to the ends

with her way
The way that I was going

to the other end
the other end transactions

with her ways to the ends
Bach helps turn it off

with her way to the ends
Selma helps too

Though we can’t help waiting for her
Is there a baby and a bear

to the other end of actions
to the other end battery dawn 

There are constant ways
The other end of means

Formerly away there are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

to their other end
the contours exchange with you

to their other contours
who know the ways to their other end

who know the way to their other end
Who knows the way

There are no constant waves
The other ends of my transactions

There are no constant ways
The other end of my transactions

To the other end of transactions
To the other end of my actions

To the other end of transactions like this
By my feeling the memory inside

the other end of actions
Like this one other end of transactions

To the other end of means like this one
Like this one the other end of means

with constant ways to the other end
to the other end of my purpose

on the other end
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

where rights ended themselves
where lights blended themselves

where I’m watching my tv
for the duration of the universe

where I am aside increased
where I am decided least

in memory elsewhere
in the long time they were on

but for memory elsewhere
in memory persisting elsewhere

Cereal and others’ health
wealth and the pace of digestion

my ethereal economic relations
I stay the right of my elections

I learned the point where I am
I learned the point of standing

where the tongue rippled
the young ripples inaudibly

The offers there already
The prospects being seen by me

traffick is there nonetheless
careening between the preambles

I assume possession to others
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
