('her', 'head')

Where I sleep at times
Without a head

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I brought my head down

I’ll get there eventually
I search with my head

higher up in the results
into the next level head

there was no promotion
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

Where in me did I host
