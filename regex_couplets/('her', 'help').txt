('her', 'help')

Where I sleep at times
people would be helped

elsewhere my purposes
The constituents would be helped

where I send and relive would be held
in the form help sale offered

Where did I lose trust in me
Bach helps turn it off

Though we are waiting for her
Selma helps too

with her way to the ends
Though we canâ€™t help waiting for her

with her way
My daughter helps too

to the other end
