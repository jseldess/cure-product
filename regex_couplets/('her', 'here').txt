('her', 'here')

Where I sleep at times
Whereas direction is beside the point

The prospects there already
I’ll get there eventually

I told her a story, she drew waves.
Of course there is a direction

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
One day there is direction

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
on a day there will be direction

Though there are quarters goals
Actually one day there is direction

The edge isn’t even there
there are quarters 

We can rest there in them with their goals
though there are quarters with goals

with goals I find there
what I find there

others desires
There are quarterly goals

There are performance reviews
here described

Then I can’t presume to need others
That’s where I sleep at times

Others desires as legitimate
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

To neither study
Where official policy is to catch and release

Where I put it beating
I’ll get there ruins

where I can lay claim to ruins
where I can claim to see the ruins

from where I can claim
from where I can claim to see the mosquitos

there was no promotion
There was very little physical activity

that potential is there for you
Where I take my liesure

But would I love her the same
there was no walking along the pleasure

there was no walking along
where you can earn more 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
there wasn’t any television 

On the other hand
there was no television to hear

but where is it
I get through there

I get from here through there
I get here through there

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
in traversing get through there

get from here through there
here is the site of the battle of maldon

And we had to say goodbye to her there
of those gathered

We had to say goodbye there
We had to buy there

where I need gravity
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

Where I lead gravity
There are spots waiting

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
One was up where it should be down

I tell you where I need gravity
Where in me did I host

Elsewhere by my memory
if there is anything 

Where I host my purposes
and elsewhere my memory

and other types of tracking technology
and elsewhere my memory of you

where I send and relive aside
where I stand and relive

where I end
where I send and retrieve aside

where I stand aside
where I stand and retrieve

where I stand aside and retrieve
where I stand and retrieve relive

Elsewhere my memory
elsewhere my purposes

Though we are waiting for her
where I send and relive would be held

Where in me did I last
where I send and relive

where I am aside at least
the point where I am

where I send and retrieve relive
where I stand and retrieve and relive

where I am aside
where I end and relive

firing and connecting somewhere
where I send and receive

where I blend and relive
Where in me did I lose

Where in me did I loose
where in me pre-worn

By my memory elsewhere
after though there’s no memory

Where in me did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

Where did we lose trust
Is there a baby and a bear

to the other end
There are constant ways

The other end of means
Formerly away there are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
There are no constant waves

The other ends of my transactions
There are no constant ways

The other end of my transactions
where rights ended themselves

where lights blended themselves
where I’m watching my tv

where I am aside increased
where I am decided least

in memory elsewhere
but for memory elsewhere

in memory persisting elsewhere
my ethereal economic relations

I learned the point where I am
where the tongue rippled

The offers there already
traffick is there nonetheless

I presume to others
