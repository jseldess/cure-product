('her', 'high')

Where I sleep at times
way high up in the inter

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I’ll pull my data higher up

higher up in the internet
I’ll pull myself higher up

I’ll get there eventually
high up in the internet

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
higher up in the results

I’ll get there ruins
high in the content architecture

where I can lay claim to ruins
high up in the architecture

where I can claim to see the ruins
high up in the content architecture

there was no promotion
way high up in the internet

There was very little physical activity
The sun high enough to enter directly 

but where is it
The sun high enough to strike directly

I assume possession to others
