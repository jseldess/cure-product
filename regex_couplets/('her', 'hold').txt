('her', 'hold')

Where I sleep at times
I take hold of my finger

To neither study
When they really take hold of my finger

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
hold at intervals riding forward

higher up in the results
Since I had to hold the entire company

there was no promotion
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

There was very little physical activity
and hold and wish to hold

I get through there
designed to hold up my underwear

where I need gravity
