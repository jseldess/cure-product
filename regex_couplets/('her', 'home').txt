('her', 'home')

Where I sleep at times
at home brought into privacy

The prospects there already
promoting from home to a new job

there was no walking along
promoting from home

where you can earn more 
from home

there wasnâ€™t any television 
that agreed home

The offers there already
at home brought into private

traffick is there nonetheless
and came home to rewind inflections

I presume to others
and come home to remind inflections

I assume possession to others
