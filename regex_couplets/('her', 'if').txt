('her', 'if')

Where I sleep at times
drifting away

I told her a story, she drew waves.
if not directly on my skin

Of course there is a direction
drifting does not feel an exception

others desires
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
at any time it can drift again

I’ll pull myself another personality type
drifting away needs

There are quarterly goals
drifting away from the task

Others desires as legitimate
if you have providence to excess

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
if he had not carried one virtue 

To neither study
out of the fifth page ruins

I’ll get there eventually
learned without too much difficulty to code

there was no promotion
That company creates a life

that potential is there for you
Life is with people

There was very little physical activity
If I take a different measure

Where I take my liesure
If I take some different measure

On the other hand
if there is anything 

Where I host my purposes
if you have providence

where I send and relive aside
if that has anything

Though we are waiting for her
if only on the way to the trash

the prospects there already
