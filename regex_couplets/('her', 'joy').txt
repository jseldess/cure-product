('her', 'joy')

Where I sleep at times
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

Of course there is a direction
I was enjoying acting against myself

there was no promotion
a futile joyous white sun

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

Though we are waiting for her
