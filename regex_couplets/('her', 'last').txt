('her', 'last')

Where I sleep at times
What was the last time

Where I take my liesure
under the last seen principle

in traversing get through there
Under the last principle 

And we had to say goodbye to her there
Under the last principle of purchasing power

where I need gravity
Where in me did I last

Elsewhere by my memory
last night

Where in me did I host
