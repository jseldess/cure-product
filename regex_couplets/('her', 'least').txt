('her', 'least')

Where I sleep at times
or argued for them at least

There was very little physical activity
where I am aside at least

the point where I am
where I am decided least

where I am aside
at least most days

where Iâ€™m watching my tv
at least instructive of myself

By my memory elsewhere
