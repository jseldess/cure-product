('her', 'let')

Where I sleep at times
But I can’t let myself treat 

others desires
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
I let myself treat

I’ll pull myself another personality type
But I can’t let myself disregard

Others desires as legitimate
It’s the third letter from the end

there was no promotion
I let it remind me again

Where I lead gravity
