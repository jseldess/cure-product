('her', 'light')

Where I sleep at times
variegated reflected light

I’ll get there eventually
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Of course there is a direction
in light of learning what we see

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
stopped light with validated fields

By my memory elsewhere
where lights blended themselves

where rights ended themselves
stopped light with validated faces

where I send and relive
