('her', 'live')

Where I sleep at times
I am to end my connections suspended live

Whereas direction is beside the point
I suspend live connections to you

The prospects there already
Which is a measure to never live out

others desires
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
Which is a pleasure to never live out

here described
where I send and relive aside

where I stand and relive
where I stand and retrieve relive

Where I host my purposes
where I send and relive would be held

Where in me did I last
where I send and relive

where I end
where I send and retrieve relive

where I stand and retrieve and relive
where I end and relive

where I am aside
where I blend and relive

Where in me did I host
and relive from burrowed travels

firing and connecting somewhere
