('her', 'longer')

Where I sleep at times
I argued the days felt longer

there was no promotion
I argued the days were longer

There was very little physical activity
I argued that the days were longer

that potential is there for you
without longer damage

without any further damage
without any longer damage

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
