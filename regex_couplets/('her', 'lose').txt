('her', 'lose')

Where I sleep at times
even when close to my owning

I get from here through there
even when close to my knowing

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
even when closed

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Where in me did I lose

Elsewhere by my memory
Where in me did I lose trust

Where did I lose trust in me
Where did we lose trust

though we are waiting for her
