('her', 'low')

Where I sleep at times
slow

I told her a story, she drew waves.
slow asynchronous

others desires
to the pillow

Others desires as legitimate
low in the content architecture

Where I put it beating
Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
out from below the fold

where I can lay claim to ruins
I am not allowed to see their face

there was no promotion
under pillowing a cloud

I get through there
