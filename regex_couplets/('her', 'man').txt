('her', 'man')

Where I sleep at times
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

I told her a story, she drew waves.
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

others desires
To my children Walt Whitman

I’ll pull myself another personality type
There are performance reviews

here described
not many face up

On the other hand
though not many freeze up

there was no television to hear
Though in not many acts

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
They have very many choices

elsewhere my purposes
and that man comes on to tell me 

there wasn’t any television 
The many transparent pixel calls

who know the way to their other end
The many transparent pixels call

to the other end
of the many transparent pixel calls

There are no constant waves
