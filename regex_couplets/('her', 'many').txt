('her', 'many')

Where I sleep at times
not many face up

On the other hand
though not many freeze up

there was no television to hear
Though in not many acts

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
They have very many choices

elsewhere my purposes
The many transparent pixel calls

who know the way to their other end
The many transparent pixels call

to the other end
of the many transparent pixel calls

There are no constant waves
