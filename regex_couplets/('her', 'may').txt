('her', 'may')

Where I sleep at times
may not be ingrained

Where I take my liesure
may not be engrained

On the other hand
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

Where in me did I host
and maybe regrettable 

The prospects there already
and maybe forgettable

I assume possession to others
