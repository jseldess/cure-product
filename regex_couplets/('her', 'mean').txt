('her', 'mean')

Where I sleep at times
What does it mean to drift

I’ll pull myself another personality type
My means without gravity

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
latency which doesn’t mean anything

Where in me did I host
The other end of means

Formerly away there are constant ways
To the other end of means like this one

Like this one the other end of means
