('her', 'middle')

Where I sleep at times
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
stopping in the middle

The prospects there already
stepping in the middle

traffick is there nonetheless
stepping off into the middle

I presume to others
stepping off in to the middle

I assume possession to others
