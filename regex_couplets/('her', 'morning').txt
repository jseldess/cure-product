('her', 'morning')

Where I sleep at times
We’ll have coffee this morning

Whereas direction is beside the point
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

I told her a story, she drew waves.
When I woke up in the morning

Of course there is a direction
before morning goals

there was no promotion
