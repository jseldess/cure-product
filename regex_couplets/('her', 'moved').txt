('her', 'moved')

Where I sleep at times
and literally moved

if there is anything 
myself moved literally as it is

Where in me did I host
I literally moved

Though we are waiting for her
and literally moved about

there wasn’t any television 
literally moved

Elsewhere by my memory
what literally moved

Where in me did I lose
not literally moved about

after though there’s no memory
not literally moved

I learned the point where I am
