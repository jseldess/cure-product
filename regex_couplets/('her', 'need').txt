('her', 'need')

Where I sleep at times
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Of course there is a direction
and can’t presume to need

others desires
Then I can’t presume to need others

If I let myself see others desires
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to feed others
drifting away needs

There are quarterly goals
I need the work

there was no television to hear
I need an explicit statement

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
which I needed for an explicit state

but where is it
You need history

I get through there
And need out in front purchase

We had to say goodbye there
where I need gravity

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I tell you where I need gravity

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
not needing to wait

where I send and relive
without really needing

Though we are waiting for her
in need one in that best own

Where in me did I host
need one in best own

with her waves
that in need one best own

By my memory elsewhere
