('her', 'nor')

Where I sleep at times
into the minority proportion of time

Whereas direction is beside the point
over the long line I would honor

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
nor work in this way daily

Where official policy is to catch and release

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
nor envy honest work

To neither study
nor envy honestly

To substitute neither study
which had on honor to be told

Where in me did I host
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor
