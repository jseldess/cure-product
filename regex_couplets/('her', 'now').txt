('her', 'now')

Where I sleep at times
On a snow day with my children

I’ll get there eventually
who knows the way

Of course there is a direction
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

One day there is direction
how can I know without direction

The edge isn’t even there
Though how can you know without direction

though there are quarters with goals
for how can you know without direction

what I find there
Right now I’m the cart

There are quarterly goals
out in the snow

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
out in the snow fall

there was no promotion
I take it out in the snow fall

But would I love her the same
I even know what I would find

On the other hand
even when close to my knowing

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
When closed to my knowing

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
knowing the constituents

Where in me did I host
who knows how to turn it off

Though we are waiting for her
who know the ways to their other end

who know the way to their other end
that their knowing

where the tongue rippled
