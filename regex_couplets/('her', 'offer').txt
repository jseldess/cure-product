('her', 'offer')

Where I sleep at times
So I presume the offers already

The prospects there already
in the form filled offered in trust

Elsewhere by my memory
in the form filled offered trust

Where in me did I loose
in the form filled offered must

Where in me pre-worn
in the form filled offered

Where did I lose trust in me
in track as offer asked 

with her waves
I assume the offers reliable

The offers there already
I presume the offers

traffick is there nonetheless
I assume the offers revisitable

I presume to others
Or can have seen offering possession

I assume possession to others
in school and can see offering

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
I assume the offers divisible
