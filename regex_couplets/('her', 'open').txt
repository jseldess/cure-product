('her', 'open')

Where I sleep at times
Before we walk across the wide opening

Of course there is a direction
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

One day there is direction
my desires were open

Where I put it beating
I wish my desires were open

I’ll get there eventually
The simple act opening surmounted

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
