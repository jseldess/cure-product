('her', 'opening')

Where I sleep at times
Before we walk across the wide opening

Of course there is a direction
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

One day there is direction
The simple act opening surmounted

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
