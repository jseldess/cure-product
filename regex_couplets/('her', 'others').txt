('her', 'others')

Where I sleep at times
others desires

I’ll get there eventually
Then I can’t presume to need others

If I let myself see others desires
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to feed others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I presume to others

Where in me did I host
Cereal and others’ health

my ethereal economic relations
I assume possession to others

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
