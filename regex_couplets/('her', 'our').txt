('her', 'our')

Where I sleep at times
reasons resources

I told her a story, she drew waves.
conversations with our purchase

Of course there is a direction
conversation with our feelings

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
You can hear it also through your leisure

I’ll get there eventually
bring your child along

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Two hours and

Where official policy is to catch and release
or an available resource

I’ll pull myself higher up
with four key value pairs

there was no promotion
or alter of course the time anyway

Though we are waiting for her
This is your voice 

To neither study
This is your choice 

To substitute neither study
This is your chance

where I send and relive aside
Who throws contours away

to the other end
who throws contours a way

There are constant ways
The contours exchange with you

to their other end
to their other contours

who know the ways to their other end
phrase them of our possessions

The prospects there already
own best form to ourselves

The offers there already
