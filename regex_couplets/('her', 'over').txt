('her', 'over')

Where I sleep at times
I step over the edge

though there are quarters with goals
If I step over the edge

what I find there
over the long time up in the sky

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
over the time line I was on

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
hovering above standing water

where I can claim to see the ruins
over the long line up in the sky

there was no promotion
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

but where is it
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

here is the site of the battle of maldon
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

elsewhere my purposes
for not paying sound overwhelmed

Where in me did I host
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

I assume possession to others
