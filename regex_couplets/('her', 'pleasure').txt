('her', 'pleasure')

Where I sleep at times
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Of course there is a direction
Which is a pleasure to never live out

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
there was no walking along the pleasure

there was no promotion
up in the television pleasure

there was no television to hear
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
