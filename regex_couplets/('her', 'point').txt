('her', 'point')

Where I sleep at times
But that is beside the point

Whereas direction is beside the point
from no one point

where I am aside at least
the point where I am

where I send and retrieve relive
I am requesting my point

where I send and relive
 as points which are my interest 

I learned the point where I am
I learned the point of standing

where the tongue rippled
