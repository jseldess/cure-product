('her', 'possession')

Where I sleep at times
I speak to them my possessions

if there is anything 
my possessions

Though we are waiting for her
my possession of my children

I presume to others
speak them of my possessions

Where in me did I host
I speak them of my possessions

with her waves
speech my possession of my children

By my memory elsewhere
I stay the right of my possessions 

I learned the point where I am
possessions people

where the tongue rippled
phrase them of our possessions

The prospects there already
phrase them of my possessions

The offers there already
Or can have seen offering possession

I assume possession to others
seen having or offering possession

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
