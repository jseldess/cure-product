('her', 'product')

Where I sleep at times
an impure product

I told her a story, she drew waves.
What is an impure product

Of course there is a direction
as a cure product

others desires
as a pure product

Then I canâ€™t presume to need others
as an impure product

drifting away needs others presume desires
the least productive of myself

where I am aside
