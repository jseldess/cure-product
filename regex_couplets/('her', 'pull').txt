('her', 'pull')

Where I sleep at times
I’ll pull myself another personality type

I’ll get there eventually
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

There are quarterly goals
I’ll pull my data higher up

higher up in the internet
I’ll pull myself higher up

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
fish pulled out of the lake

Where I put it beating
I’ll pull my data

there was no promotion
