('her', 'purchases')

Where I sleep at times
I tell you the weight of my purchases

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
Is the weight of my purchases

Where I need gravity
I have entered my purchases

where I send and relive aside
the impulse for my own purchases

where I stand aside
washed my purchases

elsewhere my purposes
for my own purchases

where I send and relive would be held
found dated for my own purchases

where I stand and relive
sound inundated for my own purchases

Where in me did I last
impulse for my own purchases

where I end
