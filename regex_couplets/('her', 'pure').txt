('her', 'pure')

Where I sleep at times
an impure product

I told her a story, she drew waves.
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

Of course there is a direction
What is an impure product

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

others desires
as a pure product

Then I can’t presume to need others
as an impure product

drifting away needs others presume desires
