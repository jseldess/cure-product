('her', 'purposes')

Where I sleep at times
I tell you my purposes

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I tell you the weight of my purposes

I tell you where I need gravity
weight of my purposes

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
Where I host my purposes

and elsewhere my memory
I have entered my purposes

and elsewhere my memory of you
the impulse for my own purposes

where I stand aside
entered into my purposes

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
elsewhere my purposes

Though we are waiting for her
for my own purposes

I learned the point where I am
