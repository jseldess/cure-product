('her', 'really')

Where I sleep at times
because it was really dark

Of course there is a direction
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

One day there is direction
When they really take hold of my finger

I’ll get there eventually
That’s when they really take

higher up in the results
without really agreeing

if there is anything 
without really speaking

where I send and relive would be held
without really breaking

where I send and relive
without really branding 

Where in me did I host
without really binding

Though we are waiting for her
without really needing

there wasn’t any television 
also didn’t really move

By my memory elsewhere
