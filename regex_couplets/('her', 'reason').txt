('her', 'reason')

Where I sleep at times
reasons resources

I told her a story, she drew waves.
with reasons

To neither study
with little reason to move

There was very little physical activity
with little reasons to aspiration

that potential is there for you
with little reason to aspiration

there was no promotion
Toward the start informally given my reasons

but where is it
More reasons around my country 

and elsewhere my memory of you
and could be inflected with reasons

The prospects there already
