('her', 'resume')

Where I sleep at times
So I presume the offers already

The prospects there already
and can’t presume to need

others desires
Then I can’t presume to need others

If I let myself see others desires
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to feed others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I resume unassimilable visions

Where I take my liesure
I resume indelible tracks

there was no television to hear
I resume attributable visions

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I continue to presume

I get through there
I presume to others

Where in me did I host
I presume the offers

The offers there already
So I resume the offers already

traffick is there nonetheless
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

I assume possession to others
