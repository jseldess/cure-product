('her', 'ring')

Where I sleep at times
interferring 

One day there is direction
bring your child along

I’ll pull myself another personality type
ring

Then I can’t presume to need others
hovering above standing water

I’ll get there eventually
actually considering the end

On the other hand
the simple act of honoring an accountant

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

I get through there
storing in surfeit

And we had to say goodbye to her there
firing and connecting somewhere

where I send and receive
The prospect for veering healthily

I presume to others
Or can have seen offering possession

I assume possession to others
in school and can see offering

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
seen having or offering possession
