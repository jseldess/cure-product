('her', 'set')

Where I sleep at times
upset by Gingrich

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
in front of the set afternoon

there was no promotion
in front of the set of regulations

There was very little physical activity
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
Um, upset by Gingrich

To substitute neither study
presets

The prospects there already
