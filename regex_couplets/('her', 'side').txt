('her', 'side')

Where I sleep at times
But that is beside the point

Whereas direction is beside the point
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

I told her a story, she drew waves.
I’m simply inside

One day there is direction
aside from the retinas

There was very little physical activity
actually considering the end

On the other hand
But my not feeling the memory aside

where I send and relive aside
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

where I stand and relive
where I send and retrieve aside

where I stand aside
aside the impulse to my purpose

where I stand aside and retrieve
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

Elsewhere my memory
But my not feeling the memory inside

where I send and relive
where I am aside at least

the point where I am
where I am aside

where I end and relive
by the side of the hosting service

Where in me did I loose
By my feeling the memory inside

There are constant ways
44 seconds inside

on the other end
But my feeling the memory aside

firing and connecting somewhere
where I am aside increased

where I am decided least
recalling aside

By my memory elsewhere
