('her', 'sleep')

Where I sleep at times
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

I told her a story, she drew waves.
So I went back to sleep

Of course there is a direction
That’s where I sleep at times

others desires
Interrupted sleep or

I’ll get there eventually
While I should be sleeping

Where official policy is to catch and release
Looking back while I should be sleeping

higher up in the results
like flattening sleep 

I get through there
