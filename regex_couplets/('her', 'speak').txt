('her', 'speak')

Where I sleep at times
not speaking

Though we are waiting for her
without really speaking

where I send and relive would be held
I speak to them

where I send and relive
would only speak willingly

Where in me did I host
I speak to them my possessions

if there is anything 
I speak them of my possessions

I presume to others
speak them of my possessions

Elsewhere by my memory
