('her', 'step')

Where I sleep at times
I step off the edge

Whereas direction is beside the point
I step over the edge

though there are quarters with goals
If I step on the edge

what I find there
What the next step

there was no promotion
from which to step off

that potential is there for you
step in by the prospect

with her waves
phase decision step in

By my memory elsewhere
step by into the prospect

The prospects there already
stepping in the middle

traffick is there nonetheless
stepping off into the middle

I presume to others
stepping off in to the middle

I assume possession to others
