('her', 'still')

Where I sleep at times
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

I told her a story, she drew waves.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Of course there is a direction
That is itself not still

The edge isn’t even there
wrestling to stay still

there are quarters 
I love my daughter still

but would I love her the same
though we are still breaking in

Though we are waiting for her
still wash conserving

Where in me pre-worn
so still them

after though there’s no memory
so still washed

Where in me did I loose
pre-worn and still wash them

Where in me did I lose trust
