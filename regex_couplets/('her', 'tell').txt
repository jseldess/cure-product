('her', 'tell')

Where I sleep at times
Then I constellate my time family country

I told her a story, she drew waves.
So I constellate the time family country

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I constellate the time

To neither study
The CEO tells me to embody values

Where I put it beating
I had to tell them the news

there was no promotion
I tell you my purposes

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes

I tell you where I need gravity
and that man comes on to tell me 

there wasn’t any television
