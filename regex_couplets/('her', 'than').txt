('her', 'than')

Where I sleep at times
It keeps coming down thankfully

Of course there is a direction
than in the incoming stream

One day there is direction
than solid ground

because there was no solid ground to continue along
Having seen more than 

I presume to others
Having seen more than I can remember 

I assume possession to others
