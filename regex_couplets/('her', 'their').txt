('her', 'their')

Where I sleep at times
We can wrestle them with their goals

We can rest there in them with their goals
I am not allowed to see their face

there was no promotion
that their economic value 

There was very little physical activity
without their agreement

if there is anything 
to their other end

to their other contours
who know the ways to their other end

who know the way to their other end
that their knowing

where the tongue rippled
