('her', 'time.')

Where I sleep at times
Then I constellate my time family country

I told her a story, she drew waves.
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

Of course there is a direction
only fragments of time with my children

on a day there will be direction
at any time it can drift again

others desires
over the long time up in the sky

I’ll get there eventually
That’s where I sleep at times

Others desires as legitimate
So I constellate the time family country

I’ll pull myself another personality type
on the time line I was on

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
 and time in the train

Where official policy is to catch and release
I spend time online learning to code

Where I put it beating
On the timeline I was on

I’ll pull myself higher up
over the time line I was on

there was no promotion
The long time I had a vision

Where I take my liesure
without the long time I was accounting

On the other hand
The long time I was a vision

I get through there
the long time I was on

I get from here through there
or alter of course the time anyway

Though we are waiting for her
formerly a long time they were on

if there is anything 
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

elsewhere my purposes
until a happier time found

Where in me did I host
formerly along time they were on

I presume to others
time they were on

By my memory elsewhere
in the long time they were on

but for memory elsewhere
formerly along the time they were on

Cereal and others’ health
