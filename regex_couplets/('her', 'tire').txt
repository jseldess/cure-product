('her', 'tire')

Where I sleep at times
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

there was no promotion
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

There was very little physical activity
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

that potential is there for you
until I could not tire 

there was no television to hear
until I could not be tired

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
for to tire as far back as my history

I get through there
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
