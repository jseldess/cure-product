('her', 'too')

Where I sleep at times
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

I told her a story, she drew waves.
too sunny to eat ice cream

Of course there is a direction
emerging this year from too much standing water

there was no promotion
learned without too much difficulty to code

There was very little physical activity
Selma knows too 

Though we are waiting for her
Selma helps too

with her ways to the ends
My daughter helps too

to the other end
