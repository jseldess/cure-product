('her', 'track')

Where I sleep at times
I reuse indelible tracks 

Where I take my liesure
The first track

On the other hand
I resume indelible tracks

there was no television to hear
in not many tracks up in the sky

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
and other types of tracking technology

To neither study
trackers collecting data on users

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
The trackers on users

elsewhere my purposes
which as tracked befitted 

Where in me did I host
which as tracked befitted phased

with her waves
sizes track for asking sound

By my memory elsewhere
sizes asking for tracking sound

The prospects there already
