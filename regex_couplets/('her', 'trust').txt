('her', 'trust')

Where I sleep at times
I have them trust in me

I get through there
in the form filled offered in trust

Elsewhere by my memory
about the sight hosting trusting

Where in me did I loose
in the form filled offered trust

where in me pre-worn
Where in me did I lose trust

Where did I lose trust in me
Where did we lose trust

though we are waiting for her
