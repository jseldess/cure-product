('her', 'turn')

Where I sleep at times
in a sharp downward turn 

I told her a story, she drew waves.
In a sharp downard turn

Of course there is a direction
sudden downward turn

others desires
I keep turning back again myself

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
I keep turning back

higher up in the results
who knows how to turn it off

Though we are waiting for her
Bach helps turn it off

with her ways to the ends
My daughter turns it off too

to the other end
I turn not sad exactly

By my memory elsewhere
I return not sad exactly

I learned the point where I am
I returned

where the tongue rippled
