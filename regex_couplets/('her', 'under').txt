('her', 'under')

Where I sleep at times
under pillowing a cloud

I get through there
under the last seen principle

in traversing get through there
she lay under the grass

of those gathered
under the grasp principle

We had to say goodbye there
under the past principle

We had to buy there
designed to hold up my underwear

where I need gravity
