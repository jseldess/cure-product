('her', 'up?')

Where I sleep at times
Ask who I am to suspend

Whereas direction is beside the point
I suspend my connections to you

The prospects there already
between bills and stuffed animals

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I’ll get there eventually

I told her a story, she drew waves.
because it was really dark

Of course there is a direction
The sun isn’t up 

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

One day there is direction
Then fall then summer

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
into the stream of pictures

on a day there will be direction
interjecting into the stream of pictures

Though there are quarters goals
They’re just not mine

Actually one day there is direction
Put in place as stationary destinations

The edge isn’t even there
And put in place as though stationary

there are quarters 
Though how can you know without direction

though there are quarters with goals
for how can you know without direction

what I find there
slow asynchronous

others desires
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Then I can’t presume to need others
as an impure product

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
as a pure product

There are quarterly goals
And as an extension of the values

here described
But I can’t let myself treat 

That’s where I sleep at times
sudden downward turn

Others desires as legitimate
Then I cannot see face value

I’ll pull my data higher up
and invaluable partner

higher up in the internet
I’ll pull myself higher up

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
You can hear it also through your leisure

To neither study
The South Carolina primary 

Where official policy is to catch and release
A turtle fished out of the lake

Where I put it beating
Out of the remnants 

higher up in the results
So I was advised to back up

I’ll get there ruins
Then the sun isn’t up 

where I can lay claim to ruins
high up in the architecture

where I can claim to see the ruins
to see the ruins

from where I can claim to see the mosquitos
emerging this year from too much standing water

there was no promotion
I hear it between bills and stuff

There was very little physical activity
I argued that the days were longer

that potential is there for you
I am full of potential

but would I love her the same
If I take a different measure

Where I take my liesure
I take it out in the snow fall

there was no walking along the pleasure
no solid ground to continue along

there was no walking along
where you can earn more 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
walking along the measure

there wasn’t any television 
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

On the other hand
though not many freeze up

there was no television to hear
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

but where is it
Then I saw into you

I get through there
in versing my surfeit

I get from here through there
I get here through there

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
without ensuing damage

in traversing get through there
under the last seen principle

get from here through there
In conversing of my purpose

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
black spots on a white surface

here is the site of the battle of maldon
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

And we had to say goodbye to her there
she lay under the grass

of those gathered
for an ungraspable purchase

We had to say goodbye there
articles all around storming around

We had to buy there
Articles all around us

where I need gravity
I tell you my purposes

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
While we’re up in the sky 

Where I lead gravity
while consuming damage

There are spots waiting
until I purchase up in the sky

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
One was up where it should be down

I tell you where I need gravity
Is the weight of my purchases

without any further damage
to any consumer damage

Though we are waiting for her
I thought

Where in me did I host
in the form filled offered in trust

Elsewhere by my memory
all parties would be held

if there is anything 
We had inhabited actually

Where I host my purposes
was not just a defeat

To substitute neither study
If you have confidence regardless all else

Please neither study
More reasons around my country 

and elsewhere my memory of you
I have entered my purchases

where I send and relive aside
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

where I stand and relive
the impulse for my own prospects

where I end
the impulse for my own purposes

where I stand aside
the impulse to my purpose

where I stand and retrieve
aside the impulse to my purpose

where I stand aside and retrieve
I have entered my purposes

Elsewhere my memory
trackers collecting data on users

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
people would be helped

elsewhere my purposes
washed my purchases

where I send and relive would be held
found dated for my own purchases

Where in me did I last
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

where I send and retrieve aside
The constituents 

where I send and relive
for my own purchases

where I stand and retrieve relive
between the drug store and the 

where I am aside at least
for the duration of the answer

the point where I am
I am requesting my point

where I send and retrieve relive
and relive from burrowed travels

where I stand and retrieve and relive
the duration of answers

where I end and relive
for the duration of answers

where I blend and relive
would only willingly break

I presume to others
own stays brought loyal

Where in me did I lose
redundant

Where in me did I loose
in the form filled offered trust

where in me pre-worn
still carefully

By my memory elsewhere
I answered about

after though there’s no memory
in the form filled offered must

Where in me did I lose trust
In my heart did I lose trust

Where did I lose trust in me
Where did we lose trust

with her waves
I end up in Bach 

My daughter with her way
But my not feeling the memory inside

with her way
I end up Bach

with her ways to the ends
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

with her way to the ends
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

Though we can’t help waiting for her
My daughter helps too

to the other end
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

to the other end of actions
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

the other end transactions
Who throws contours away

There are constant ways
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

to their other end
the contours exchange with you

to their other contours
and end up in Bach

There are no constant ways
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

the other end of actions
I end up Bach forty-one seconds in

with constant ways to the other end
to the other end of my purpose

to the other end of transactions
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

on the other end
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

where rights ended themselves
I assumed what I draw

where I am aside
But my not feeling the memory aside

firing and connecting somewhere
for the duration of the universe

where I am aside increased
the least productive of myself

where I’m watching my tv
at least instructive of myself

in memory elsewhere
radiating from housing

but for memory elsewhere
I answered what I thought

in memory persisting elsewhere
I answered what I thought about

where lights blended themselves
about 

I learned the point where I am
requesting my standing

where the tongue rippled
the young ripples inaudibly

The offers there already
at home brought into private

traffick is there nonetheless
I presume the offers

I assume possession to others
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
