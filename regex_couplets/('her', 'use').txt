('her', 'use')

Where I sleep at times
because it was really dark

Of course there is a direction
You use the most essential parts

I’ll get there eventually
I reuse unassimilable visions

Where I take my liesure
because there was no solid ground to continue along

there wasn’t any television 
I reuse indelible tracks 

On the other hand
I used my technology

where I need gravity
trackers collecting data on users

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
The trackers on users

elsewhere my purposes
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

Where I send and relive aside
I stand and retrieve the impuse

Elsewhere my memory
useless for not having paid

Where in me did I host
