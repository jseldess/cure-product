('her', 'versing')

Where I sleep at times
in traversing my purchase

Where I take my liesure
though as for conversing

there was no television to hear
of my purpose in versing

I get through there
in versing my surfeit

I get from here through there
of my purpose in conversing

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
in traversing get through there

get from here through there
In conversing of my purpose

I get here through there
in traversing my purpose

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
