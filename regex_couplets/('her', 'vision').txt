('her', 'vision')

Where I sleep at times
I had me a vision

there was no promotion
The planning process for visions

There was very little physical activity
aspirating with visions

that potential is there for you
aspirating with little visions

but would I love her the same
I reuse unassimilable visions

Where I take my liesure
there wasnâ€™t any television 

On the other hand
up in the television pleasure

there was no television to hear
I resume attributable visions

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
The long time I had a vision

but where is it
The long time I was a vision

I get through there
attributable visions

I get from here through there
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
joined in my television

By my memory elsewhere
visions that can be attainable

The prospects there already
revisions that can be attributable

traffick is there nonetheless
