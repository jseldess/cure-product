('her', 'waiting')

Where I sleep at times
There are spots waiting

or in some imaginary elsewhere
Though we are waiting for her

Where in me did I host
Though we are waiting 

if there is anything 
Though we can’t help waiting

with her way to the ends
Though we can’t help waiting for her

with her way
waiting out front or up above 

I learned the point where I am
