('her', 'walk')

Where I sleep at times
Before we walk across the wide field

I’ll get there eventually
Before we walk across the wide opening

Of course there is a direction
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

One day there is direction
there was no walking along the pleasure

there was no promotion
there was no walking along

where you can earn more 
walking along the measure

there wasn’t any television 
I walk up and don’t work anymore

but where is it
walking into percents blending themselves

I get through there
