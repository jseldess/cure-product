('her', 'want')

Where I sleep at times
When I want something

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
I want to find a way to block it incoming

One day there is direction
I want but not to impart cynicism

others desires
I want to cite a poem so usual

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I want to cite a poem

To neither study
all that I can think I want

Where I take my liesure
