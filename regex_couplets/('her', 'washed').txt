('her', 'washed')

Where I sleep at times
washed by my memory

Though we are waiting for her
washed my memory

elsewhere my purposes
washed my purchases

where I send and relive would be held
washed

By my memory elsewhere
washed I answered about

after though thereâ€™s no memory
so still washed

Where in me did I loose
