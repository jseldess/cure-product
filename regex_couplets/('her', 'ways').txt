('her', 'ways')

Where I sleep at times
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

Of course there is a direction
always watching

I get through there
deep into pathways from repeated travels

where I send and relive
with constant ways 

to the other end
with her ways to the ends

Though we are waiting for her
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

to the other end of actions
There are constant ways

The other end of means
Formerly away there are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
with no constant ways 

who know the ways to their other end
There are no constant ways

The other end of my transactions
with constant ways to the other end

to the other end of transactions
