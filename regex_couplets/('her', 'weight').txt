('her', 'weight')

Where I sleep at times
I tell you the weight of my purchases

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I tell you the weight of my purposes

I tell you where I need gravity
Is the weight of my purchases

Where I need gravity
weight of my purposes

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
The weight kept moaned impression

where the tongue rippled
