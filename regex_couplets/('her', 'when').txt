('her', 'When')

Where I sleep at times
When I woke up in the morning

Of course there is a direction
When I want something

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
When we had jobs that were to earn

To neither study
When they really take hold of my finger

I’ll get there eventually
When closed to my knowing

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
When I'm watching my tv 

there wasn’t any television
