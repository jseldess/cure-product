('her', 'will')

Where I sleep at times
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

on a day there will be direction
will not be the same

On the other hand
that will spur me on

I get through there
that will try me on 

I get from here through there
would only willingly break

Where in me did I host
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

Elsewhere by my memory
my daughter will learn 

with her waves
