('her', 'you.')

Where I sleep at times
Though how can you know without direction

though there are quarters with goals
for how can you know without direction

what I find there
You can hear it also through your leisure

I’ll get there eventually
bring your child along

I’ll pull myself another personality type
if you have providence to excess

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
If you have confidence regardless all else

To neither study
May I have your zip code

Where official policy is to catch and release
That you can see only the back of

there was no promotion
since you can imagine movement

There was very little physical activity
where you can earn more 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
you need history

I get through there
a futile joyous white sun

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I tell you my purposes

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes

I tell you where I need gravity
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

here is the site of the battle of maldon
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

Though we are waiting for her
This is your voice 

To substitute neither study
This is your chance

where I send and relive aside
the young ripples inaudibly

The prospects there already
