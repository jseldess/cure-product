('her', 'your')

Where I sleep at times
You can hear it also through your leisure

I’ll get there eventually
bring your child along

I’ll pull myself another personality type
May I have your zip code

Where official policy is to catch and release
your bid to the next highest ranked network

there was no promotion
This is your voice 

To neither study
This is your choice 

To substitute neither study
This is your chance

where I send and relive aside
