('here', 'As')

Where I sleep at times
Ask who I am to suspend

Whereas direction is beside the point
Ask who I am

The prospects there already
As though stationary and a destination

The edge isn’t even there
Assimilable or

I’ll get there eventually
Aspirational strategy

there was no promotion
As an extension of the values

that potential is there for you
As a clone, illegally conceived

here is the site of the battle of maldon
