('here', 'That')

Where I sleep at times
That’s exaclty what I want for them

One day there is direction
That is itself not still

The edge isn’t even there
That’s where I sleep at times

I’ll get there eventually
That’s when they really take

I’ll get there ruins
That you can see only the back of

there was no promotion
That company creates a life

that potential is there for you
That I captured an afterimage

here is the site of the battle of maldon
That are my right to say

my ethereal economic relations
