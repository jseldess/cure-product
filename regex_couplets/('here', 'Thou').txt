('here', 'Thou')

Where I sleep at times
Though there are quarters goals

Actually one day there is direction
Though how can you know without direction

though there are quarters with goals
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

Where I take my liesure
Though in not many acts

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
Though we are waiting for her

Where in me did I host
Though we are breaking 

where I send and relive aside
Though we are waiting 

if there is anything 
Though we can’t help waiting

Is there a baby and a bear
