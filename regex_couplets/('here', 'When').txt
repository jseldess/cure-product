('here', 'When')

Where I sleep at times
When I woke up in the morning

Of course there is a direction
When I want something

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
When we had jobs that were to earn

I’ll get there eventually
When they really take hold of my finger

I’ll get there ruins
When closed to my knowing

here is the site of the battle of maldon
When I'm watching my tv 

there wasn’t any television
