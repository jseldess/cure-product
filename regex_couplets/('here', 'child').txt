('here', 'child')

Where I sleep at times
On a snow day with my children

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
as pure as my children

Of course there is a direction
especially in a child

One day there is direction
only fragments of time with my children

on a day there will be direction
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

There are quarterly goals
even my child

We had to say goodbye there
Even the children

 of those gathered
my possession of my children

Where in me did I host
speech my possession of my children

Is there a baby and a bear
