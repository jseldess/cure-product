('here', 'code')

Where I sleep at times
as long as I have access to the code

One day there is direction
May I have your zip code

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
I spend time online learning to code

Where I put it beating
learned without too much difficulty to code

there was no promotion
falling off the encoded end

Where I take my liesure
encoded off the end

there was no television to hear
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

One was up where it should be down
Is the weight of my click or zipcode

Where I need gravity
I click or my zipcode

I tell you where I need gravity
zipcode

Is there a baby and a bear
