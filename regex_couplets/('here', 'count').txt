('here', 'count')

Where I sleep at times
Then I constellate my time family country

Of course there is a direction
So I constellate the time family country

I’ll get there eventually
I brought my count down

I’ll get there ruins
without the long time I was accounting

Where I take my liesure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
around my country 

but where is it
without the long time I was on accounting

I get through there
More reasons around my country 

and elsewhere my memory of you
