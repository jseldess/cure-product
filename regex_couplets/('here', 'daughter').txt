('here', 'daughter')

Where I sleep at times
I love my daughter still

Where I take my liesure
with my daughter

Is there a baby and a bear
My daughter helps too

There are constant ways
my daughter will learn 

By my memory elsewhere
my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me

in memory elsewhere
