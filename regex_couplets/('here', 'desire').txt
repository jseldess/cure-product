('here', 'desire')

Where I sleep at times
others desires

I’ll get there eventually
If I let myself see others desires

There are quarterly goals
drifting away needs others presume desires

That’s where I sleep at times
Others desires as legitimate

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
my desires were open

Where I put it beating
I wish my desires were open

I’ll get there ruins
