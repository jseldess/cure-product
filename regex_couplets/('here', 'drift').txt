('here', 'drift')

Where I sleep at times
drifting away

Of course there is a direction
drifting does not feel an exception

I’ll get there eventually
drifting away needs others presume desires

There are quarterly goals
at any time it can drift again

That’s where I sleep at times
drifting away from the task

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
