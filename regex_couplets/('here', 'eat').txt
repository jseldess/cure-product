('here', 'eat')

Where I sleep at times
too sunny to eat ice cream

Of course there is a direction
I reach repeated expressions first

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
But I can’t let myself treat 

I’ll get there eventually
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

here described
Then I can’t presume to treat others

That’s where I sleep at times
I let myself treat

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
was not just a defeat

Where official policy is to catch and release
Where I put it beating

I’ll get there ruins
executive breath

there was no promotion
of the habits they create.

There was very little physical activity
That company creates a life

that potential is there for you
it was not just a defeat

but where is it
And from that great distance

Where I lead gravity
And from a great distance

There are spots waiting
for the creation of the universe

the point where I am
burrowed about from repeated travels

where I send and relive
from cables reheated travels

where I stand and retrieve and relive
