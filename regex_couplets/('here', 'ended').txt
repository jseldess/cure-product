('here', 'ended')

Where I sleep at times
I am to end my connections suspended live

Whereas direction is beside the point
Suspended live in connections to you

The prospects there already
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

where rights ended themselves
where lights blended themselves

By my memory elsewhere
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

my ethereal economic relations
