('here', 'excess')

Where I sleep at times
Did he carry one virtue to excess

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
if you have providence to excess

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
not one virtue to excess

Where official policy is to catch and release
If articles can storm in excess

We had to say goodbye there
