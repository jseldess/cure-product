('here', 'know')

Where I sleep at times
who knows the way

Of course there is a direction
how can I know without direction

The edge isnâ€™t even there
Though how can you know without direction

though there are quarters with goals
for how can you know without direction

what I find there
I even know what I would find

there was no television to hear
even when close to my knowing

in traversing get through there
When closed to my knowing

here is the site of the battle of maldon
knowing the constituents

Where in me did I host
who knows how to turn it off

Is there a baby and a bear
who know the ways to their other end

There are no constant waves
that their knowing

where the tongue rippled
