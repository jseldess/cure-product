('here', 'learn')

Where I sleep at times
in light of learning what we see

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
I spend time online learning to code

Where I put it beating
learned without too much difficulty to code

there was no promotion
decisioned to learn 

Where in me did I host
decisioned to learn back

Is there a baby and a bear
phase decision for learning

By my memory elsewhere
I learned my location

I learned the point where I am
I learned the point of standing

where the tongue rippled
for learning by the prospect

The prospects there already
