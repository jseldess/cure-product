('here', 'lose')

Where I sleep at times
even when close to my owning

I get from here through there
even when close to my knowing

in traversing get through there
even when closed

here is the site of the battle of maldon
Where in me did I lose

Elsewhere by my memory
Where in me did I lose trust

Where did I lose trust in me
Where did we lose trust

Is there a baby and a bear
