('here', 'low')

Where I sleep at times
slow

Of course there is a direction
slow asynchronous

I’ll get there eventually
to the pillow

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
low in the content architecture

Where I put it beating
Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture

I’ll get there ruins
out from below the fold

where I can lay claim to ruins
I am not allowed to see their face

there was no promotion
under pillowing a cloud

I get through there
