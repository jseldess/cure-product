('here', 'man')

Where I sleep at times
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

Of course there is a direction
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

I’ll get there eventually
To my children Walt Whitman

There are quarterly goals
There are performance reviews

here described
not many face up

there was no television to hear
Though in not many acts

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

here is the site of the battle of maldon
They have very many choices

elsewhere my purposes
and that man comes on to tell me 

there wasn’t any television 
The many transparent pixel calls

There are no constant waves
