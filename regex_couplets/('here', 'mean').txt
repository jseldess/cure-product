('here', 'mean')

Where I sleep at times
What does it mean to drift

I’ll get there eventually
My means without gravity

here is the site of the battle of maldon
latency which doesn’t mean anything

Where in me did I host
The other end of means

Formerly away there are constant ways
To the other end of means like this one

where rights ended themselves
