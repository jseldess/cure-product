('here', 'rest')

Where I sleep at times
wrestling to stay still

there are quarters 
We can wrestle them with their goals

We can rest there in them with their goals
that agreed one of rest

Where in me did I host
Aligned or not with my interests

By my memory elsewhere
 as points which are my interest 

I learned the point where I am
home rest form to ourselves 

The prospects there already
