('here', 'ring')

Where I sleep at times
interferring 

One day there is direction
bring your child along

I’ll get there eventually
ring

That’s where I sleep at times
hovering above standing water

where I can claim to see the ruins
actually considering the end

there was no television to hear
the simple act of honoring an accountant

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

I get through there
storing in surfeit

And we had to say goodbye to her there
firing and connecting somewhere

where I send and receive
The prospect for veering healthily
