('here', 'set')

Where I sleep at times
upset by Gingrich

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
in front of the set afternoon

there was no promotion
in front of the set of regulations

There was very little physical activity
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

here is the site of the battle of maldon
Um, upset by Gingrich

and elsewhere my memory of you
presets

The prospects there already
