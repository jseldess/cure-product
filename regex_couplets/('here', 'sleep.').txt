('here', 'sleep.')

Where I sleep at times
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Of course there is a direction
That’s where I sleep at times

I’ll get there eventually
Interrupted sleep or

Where official policy is to catch and release
While I should be sleeping 

I’ll get there ruins
like flattening sleep 

I get through there
