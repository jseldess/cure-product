('here', 'stay')

Where I sleep at times
wrestling to stay still

there are quarters 
So stay with us

that potential is there for you
own stays brought loyal

Where in me did I host
own that stays brought loyal

Is there a baby and a bear
that stays brought loyal

By my memory elsewhere
I stay the right of my elections

I learned the point where I am
home stays brought loyal

The prospects there already
