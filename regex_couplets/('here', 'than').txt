('here', 'than')

Where I sleep at times
It keeps coming down thankfully

Of course there is a direction
than in the incoming stream

One day there is direction
than solid ground

because there was no solid ground to continue along
Having seen more than 

Where in me did I host
Having seen more than I can remember
