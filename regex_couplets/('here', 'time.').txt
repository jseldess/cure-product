('here', 'time.')

Where I sleep at times
Then I constellate my time family country

Of course there is a direction
only fragments of time with my children

on a day there will be direction
at any time it can drift again

I’ll get there eventually
That’s where I sleep at times

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
So I constellate the time family country

here described
 and time in the train

Where official policy is to catch and release
I spend time online learning to code

Where I put it beating
On the timeline I was on

there was no promotion
The long time I had a vision

Where I take my liesure
without the long time I was accounting

there was no television to hear
The long time I was a vision

I get through there
the long time I was on

I get from here through there
or alter of course the time anyway

Where in me did I host
formerly a long time they were on

if there is anything 
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

elsewhere my purposes
until a happier time found

Elsewhere my memory
formerly along time they were on

Is there a baby and a bear
time they were on

By my memory elsewhere
in the long time they were on

but for memory elsewhere
formerly along the time they were on

my ethereal economic relations
