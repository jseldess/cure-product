('here', 'too')

Where I sleep at times
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

Of course there is a direction
emerging this year from too much standing water

there was no promotion
learned without too much difficulty to code

There was very little physical activity
Selma knows too 

Is there a baby and a bear
My daughter helps too

There are constant ways
