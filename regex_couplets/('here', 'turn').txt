('here', 'turn')

Where I sleep at times
in a sharp downward turn 

Of course there is a direction
sudden downward turn

I’ll get there eventually
I keep turning back again myself

Where official policy is to catch and release
I keep turning back

I’ll get there ruins
who knows how to turn it off

Is there a baby and a bear
My daughter turns it off too

There are constant ways
I turn not sad exactly

By my memory elsewhere
I return not sad exactly

I learned the point where I am
I returned

where the tongue rippled
