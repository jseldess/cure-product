('here', 'up?')

Where I sleep at times
Ask who I am to suspend

Whereas direction is beside the point
I suspend my connections to you

The prospects there already
between bills and stuffed animals

I’ll get there eventually
Then I constellate my time family country

Of course there is a direction
The sun isn’t up 

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

One day there is direction
Then fall then summer

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
into the stream of pictures

on a day there will be direction
interjecting into the stream of pictures

Though there are quarters goals
They’re just not mine

Actually one day there is direction
Put in place as stationary destinations

The edge isn’t even there
And put in place as though stationary

there are quarters 
Though how can you know without direction

though there are quarters with goals
for how can you know without direction

what I find there
slow asynchronous

There are quarterly goals
And as an extension of the values

here described
Then I can’t presume to need others

That’s where I sleep at times
sudden downward turn

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
You can hear it also through your leisure

Where official policy is to catch and release
A turtle fished out of the lake

Where I put it beating
Out of the remnants 

I’ll get there ruins
Then the sun isn’t up 

where I can lay claim to ruins
high up in the architecture

where I can claim to see the ruins
to see the ruins

from where I can claim to see the mosquitos
emerging this year from too much standing water

there was no promotion
I hear it between bills and stuff

There was very little physical activity
I argued that the days were longer

that potential is there for you
I am full of potential

Where I take my liesure
I take it out in the snow fall

there was no walking along the pleasure
no solid ground to continue along

there was no walking along
where you can earn more 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
walking along the measure

there wasn’t any television 
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

there was no television to hear
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

but where is it
Then I saw into you

I get through there
If I take a different measure

I get from here through there
I get here through there

in traversing get through there
under the last seen principle

get from here through there
In conversing of my purpose

here is the site of the battle of maldon
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

And we had to say goodbye to her there
she lay under the grass

of those gathered
for an ungraspable purchase

We had to say goodbye there
articles all around storming around

We had to buy there
Articles all around us

where I need gravity
I tell you my purposes

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
While we’re up in the sky 

Where I lead gravity
while consuming damage

There are spots waiting
until I purchase up in the sky

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
One was up where it should be down

I tell you where I need gravity
Is the weight of my purchases

Where in me did I host
in the form filled offered in trust

Elsewhere by my memory
all parties would be held

if there is anything 
We had inhabited actually

Where I host my purposes
The South Carolina primary 

and elsewhere my memory of you
I have entered my purchases

where I send and relive aside
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

where I stand and relive
the impulse for my own prospects

where I end
the impulse for my own purposes

where I stand aside
the impulse to my purpose

where I stand and retrieve
aside the impulse to my purpose

where I stand aside and retrieve
I have entered my purposes

Elsewhere my memory
trackers collecting data on users

elsewhere my purposes
washed my purchases

where I send and relive would be held
found dated for my own purchases

Where in me did I last
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

where I send and retrieve aside
The constituents 

where I send and relive
for my own purchases

where I stand and retrieve relive
between the drug store and the 

where I am aside at least
for the duration of the answer

the point where I am
I am requesting my point

where I send and retrieve relive
and relive from burrowed travels

where I stand and retrieve and relive
the duration of answers

where I end and relive
for the duration of answers

where I blend and relive
would only willingly break

Where in me did I lose
redundant

Where in me did I loose
in the form filled offered trust

where in me pre-worn
still carefully

By my memory elsewhere
I answered about

after though there’s no memory
in the form filled offered must

Where in me did I lose trust
In my heart did I lose trust

Where did I lose trust in me
Where did we lose trust

Is there a baby and a bear
Though we are waiting for her

There are constant ways
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

There are no constant waves
But my not feeling the memory inside

There are no constant ways
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

Formerly away there are constant ways
I end up Bach

where rights ended themselves
I assumed what I draw

where I am aside
But my not feeling the memory aside

firing and connecting somewhere
for the duration of the universe

where I am aside increased
the least productive of myself

where I’m watching my tv
at least instructive of myself

in memory elsewhere
radiating from housing

but for memory elsewhere
I answered what I thought

in memory persisting elsewhere
I answered what I thought about

where lights blended themselves
about 

I learned the point where I am
requesting my standing

where the tongue rippled
the young ripples inaudibly

The offers there already
at home brought into private

traffick is there nonetheless
I presume the offers
