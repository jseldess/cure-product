('here', 'us')

Where I sleep at times
Ask who I am to suspend

Whereas direction is beside the point
I suspend my connections to you

The prospects there already
asynchronous 

Of course there is a direction
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

One day there is direction
They’re just not mine

Actually one day there is direction
russling to stay still

there are quarters 
slow asynchronous

I’ll get there eventually
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

here described
I want to cite a poem so usual

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
was not just a defeat

Where official policy is to catch and release
in a continuous vertiginous dream

Where I put it beating
You use the most essential parts

I’ll get there ruins
The ventillation rushes on

there was no promotion
So stay with us

that potential is there for you
but it continued rippling muscle

There was very little physical activity
I reuse unassimilable visions

Where I take my liesure
because there was no solid ground to continue along

there wasn’t any television 
I reuse indelible tracks 

there was no television to hear
it was not just a defeat

but where is it
I have them trust in me

I get through there
a futile joyous white sun

here is the site of the battle of maldon
Articles all around us

And we had to say goodbye to her there
I wear suspenders

where I need gravity
I used my technology

There are spots waiting
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

Where in me did I host
in the form filled offered in trust

Elsewhere by my memory
trackers collecting data on users

elsewhere my purposes
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

Where I send and relive aside
I stand and retrieve the impuse

Elsewhere my memory
useless for not having paid

if there is anything 
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

Where in me did I lose
about the sight hosting trusting

Where in me did I loose
in the form filled offered trust

where in me pre-worn
in the form filled offered must

Where in me did I lose trust
In my heart did I lose trust

Where did I lose trust in me
Where did we lose trust

Is there a baby and a bear
radiating from housing

but for memory elsewhere
