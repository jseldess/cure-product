('here', 'versing')

Where I sleep at times
in traversing my purchase

Where I take my liesure
though as for conversing

there was no television to hear
of my purpose in versing

I get through there
in versing my surfeit

I get from here through there
of my purpose in conversing

in traversing get through there
In conversing of my purpose

I get here through there
in traversing my purpose

here is the site of the battle of maldon
