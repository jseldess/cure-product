('here', 'visible')

Where I sleep at times
I assumed it was visible

Whereas direction is beside the point
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

I’ll get there eventually
And make myself a visible

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
Divisible or

Where official policy is to catch and release
I assume the offers divisible

The prospects there already
that they were divisible
