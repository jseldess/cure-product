('here', 'wait')

Where I sleep at times
There are spots waiting

or in some imaginary elsewhere
Though we are waiting for her

Where in me did I host
not needing to wait

where I send and relive
Though we are waiting 

if there is anything 
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

Is there a baby and a bear
waiting out front or up above 

I learned the point where I am
