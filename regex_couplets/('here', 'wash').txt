('here', 'wash')

Where I sleep at times
washed by my memory

if there is anything 
washed my memory

elsewhere my purposes
washed my purchases

where I send and relive would be held
still wash conserving

Where in me pre-worn
washed

By my memory elsewhere
washed I answered about

after though thereâ€™s no memory
so still washed

Where in me did I loose
pre-worn and still wash them

Where in me did I lose trust
