('high', 'On')

way high up in the inter
One year or

higher up in the results
On the bandwidth I was on

high in the content architecture
On the timeline I was on

Iâ€™ll pull myself higher up
On the other hand

The sun high enough to enter directly 
One was up where it should be down

The sun high enough to strike directly
