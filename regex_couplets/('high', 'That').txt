('high', 'That')

way high up in the inter
Thatâ€™s when they really take

higher up in the results
That you can see only the back of

your bid to the next highest ranked network
That company creates a life

The sun high enough to enter directly 
That I captured an afterimage

The sun high enough to strike directly
