('high', 'do')

way high up in the inter
The dogs and lillies

higher up in the results
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

your bid to the next highest ranked network
What I do in my liesure

The sun high enough to enter directly 
I walk up and don’t work anymore

The sun high enough to strike directly
