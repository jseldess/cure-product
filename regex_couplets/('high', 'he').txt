('high', 'he')

way high up in the inter
Falling off the edge of the face

I’ll pull my data higher up
higher up in the internet

I’ll pull myself higher up
I’ll get there eventually

high up in the internet
on the time line I was on

way high up in the internet
Then

higher up in the results
rewind before the sun

high in the content architecture
out from below the fold

high up in the results
where I can lay claim to ruins

high up in the architecture
where I can claim to see the ruins

high up in the content architecture
there was no promotion

your bid to the next highest ranked network
the next network in your ranking

The sun high enough to enter directly 
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

The sun high enough to strike directly
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
