('high', 'here')

way high up in the inter
I’ll get there eventually

high up in the internet
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

higher up in the results
I’ll get there ruins

high in the content architecture
where I can lay claim to ruins

high up in the architecture
where I can claim to see the ruins

high up in the content architecture
there was no promotion

I’ll pull myself higher up
There was very little physical activity

The sun high enough to enter directly 
but where is it

The sun high enough to strike directly
