('high', 'inter')

way high up in the inter
higher up in the internet

Iâ€™ll pull myself higher up
high up in the internet

way high up in the internet
hold at intervals riding forward

higher up in the results
with internally regulated climate

your bid to the next highest ranked network
Then I saw them interview

The sun high enough to enter directly
my interfaced stand data

The sun high enough to strike directly
