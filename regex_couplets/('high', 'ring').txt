('high', 'ring')

way high up in the inter
ring

higher up in the results
hovering above standing water

high up in the architecture
actually considering the end

The sun high enough to enter directly 
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

The sun high enough to strike directly
Or can have seen offering possession
