('high', 'set')

way high up in the inter
upset by Gingrich

higher up in the results
in front of the set afternoon

your bid to the next highest ranked network
in front of the set of regulations

The sun high enough to enter directly 
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

The sun high enough to strike directly
