('high', 'time.')

way high up in the inter
over the long time up in the sky

I’ll pull my data higher up
on the time line I was on

way high up in the internet
over the time line I was on

higher up in the results
On the timeline I was on

I’ll pull myself higher up
over the long time I was on

your bid to the next highest ranked network
The long time I had a vision

The sun high enough to enter directly 
The long time I was a vision

The sun high enough to strike directly
