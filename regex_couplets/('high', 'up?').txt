('high', 'up?')

way high up in the inter
executive breath

I’ll pull my data higher up
and invaluable partner

higher up in the internet
I’ll pull myself higher up

high up in the internet
way high up in the internet

higher up in the results
So I was advised to back up

high in the content architecture
out from below the fold

high up in the results
I’ll get there eventually

high up in the architecture
where I can claim to see the ruins

high up in the content architecture
And as an extension of the values

your bid to the next highest ranked network
the next network in your ranking

The sun high enough to enter directly 
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

The sun high enough to strike directly
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
