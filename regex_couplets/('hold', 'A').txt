('hold', 'A')

I take hold of my finger
BREAK

When they really take hold of my finger
And as an extension of the values

Since I had to hold the entire company
As an extension of the values

and hold and wish to hold
COPY DREAM 

designed to hold up my underwear
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
