('hold', 'so')

I take hold of my finger
reasons resources

When they really take hold of my finger
or an available resource

Since I had to hold the entire company
My associations

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
with little reason to move

and hold and wish to hold
If I take some different measure

designed to hold up my underwear
or in some imaginary elsewhere
