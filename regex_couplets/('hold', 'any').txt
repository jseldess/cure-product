('hold', 'any')

I take hold of my finger
Or the company

When they really take hold of my finger
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

Since I had to hold the entire company
The days aligned for company

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
The days aligned long company

and hold and wish to hold
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

designed to hold up my underwear
without any further damage
