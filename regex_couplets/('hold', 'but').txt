('hold', 'but')

I take hold of my finger
Attributable or

When they really take hold of my finger
but the sun isnâ€™t up

Since I had to hold the entire company
but it continued

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
but it continued rippling muscle

and hold and wish to hold
I resume attributable visions

designed to hold up my underwear
that decisions can be attributable
