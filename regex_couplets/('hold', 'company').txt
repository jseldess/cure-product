('hold', 'company')

I take hold of my finger
Or the company

When they really take hold of my finger
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

Since I had to hold the entire company
The days aligned for company

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
The days aligned long company

and hold and wish to hold
