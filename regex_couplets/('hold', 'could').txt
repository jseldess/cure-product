('hold', 'could')

I take hold of my finger
and could be mapped and weighed

When they really take hold of my finger
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

hold at intervals riding forward
until I could not tire 

and hold and wish to hold
I could effect credit

designed to hold up my underwear
I could consume the dream
