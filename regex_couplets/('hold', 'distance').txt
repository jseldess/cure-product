('hold', 'distance')

I take hold of my finger
A person from a distance

When they really take hold of my finger
Falling from this distance

Since I had to hold the entire company
And from a weak distance

and hold and wish to hold
And from that great distance

designed to hold up my underwear
And from a great distance
