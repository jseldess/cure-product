('hold', 'do')

I take hold of my finger
I brought my head down

When they really take hold of my finger
which I brought down with qualities

hold at intervals riding forward
I brought my qualities down

Since I had to hold the entire company
What I do in my liesure

and hold and wish to hold
here is the site of the battle of maldon

designed to hold up my underwear
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
