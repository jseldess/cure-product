('hold', 'eat')

I take hold of my finger
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

When they really take hold of my finger
executive breath

Since I had to hold the entire company
That company creates a life

and hold and wish to hold
And from that great distance

designed to hold up my underwear
And from a great distance
