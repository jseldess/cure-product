('hold', 'he')

I take hold of my finger
Then fall then summer

When they really take hold of my finger
I search with my head

hold at intervals riding forward
with my head

Since I had to hold the entire company
The days long aligned

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
that I was the arm of this

and hold and wish to hold
I get through there

designed to hold up my underwear
I designed them to hold up my underwear

that hold and wish to hold
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
