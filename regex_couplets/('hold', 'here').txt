('hold', 'here')

I take hold of my finger
I’ll get there eventually

When they really take hold of my finger
I’ll get there ruins

Since I had to hold the entire company
there was no promotion

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
There was very little physical activity

and hold and wish to hold
I get through there

designed to hold up my underwear
where I need gravity
