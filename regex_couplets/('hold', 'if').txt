('hold', 'if')

I take hold of my finger
if you have providence to excess

When they really take hold of my finger
out of the fifth page ruins

Since I had to hold the entire company
That company creates a life

and hold and wish to hold
If I take a different measure

designed to hold up my underwear
if there is anything
