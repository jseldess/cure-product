('hold', 'time.')

I take hold of my finger
So I constellate the time family country

When they really take hold of my finger
On the timeline I was on

Since I had to hold the entire company
The long time I had a vision

and hold and wish to hold
in the long time they were on

designed to hold up my underwear
or alter of course the time anyway
