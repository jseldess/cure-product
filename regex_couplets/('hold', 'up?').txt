('hold', 'up?')

I take hold of my finger
Then fall then summer

When they really take hold of my finger
While I should be sleeping 

hold at intervals riding forward
Looking back while I should be sleeping

Since I had to hold the entire company
I argued the days were longer

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
with full potential to movement

and hold and wish to hold
I could effect credit

designed to hold up my underwear
I designed them to hold up my underwear

that hold and wish to hold
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
