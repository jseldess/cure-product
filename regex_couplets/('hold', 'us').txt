('hold', 'us')

I take hold of my finger
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

When they really take hold of my finger
in a continuous vertiginous dream

hold at intervals riding forward
In a continuous theme

Since I had to hold the entire company
So stay with us

and hold and wish to hold
I have them trust in me

designed to hold up my underwear
I wear suspenders

I designed them to hold up my underwear
suspenders

that hold and wish to hold
a futile joyous white sun
