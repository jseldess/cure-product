('hold', 'very')

I take hold of my finger
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

Since I had to hold the entire company
There was very little physical activity

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
embodied everyday

and hold and wish to hold
They have very many choices
