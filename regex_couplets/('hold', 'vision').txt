('hold', 'vision')

I take hold of my finger
I had me a vision

Since I had to hold the entire company
aspirating with visions

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
embodied with little visions

and hold and wish to hold
I resume attributable visions

designed to hold up my underwear
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
