('hold', 'you.')

I take hold of my finger
if you have providence to excess

When they really take hold of my finger
That you can see only the back of

Since I had to hold the entire company
since you can imagine movement

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
where you can earn more 

and hold and wish to hold
a futile joyous white sun

designed to hold up my underwear
I tell you my purposes
