('home', 'agreed')

at home brought into privacy
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed

that agreed home
that agreed to one the people

home stays brought loyal
that agreed one best

the people in home form
that agreed home to people

home rest form to ourselves 
that agreed one of rest

So I find myself at home
