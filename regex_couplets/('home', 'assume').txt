('home', 'assume')

at home brought into privacy
I assumed it was visible

promoting from home to a new job
I assumed 

that agreed home
I assume the offers reliable

and came home to rewind inflections
I assume the offers revisitable

and came home to rewind
I assumed that they were divisible

and come home to remind inflections
I assume possession to others
