('home', 'form')

at home brought into privacy
There are performance reviews

promoting from home to a new job
Toward the start informally given my reasons

that agreed home
own best form

and came home to rewind inflections
own best form to ourselves

home stays brought loyal
the people in home form

that agreed home to people
home rest form to ourselves 

So I find myself at home
