('home', 'he')

at home brought into privacy
The prospects there already

promoting from home to a new job
there was no walking along

promoting from home
where you can earn more 

from home
walking along the measure

walking from home along the measure
there wasn’t any television 

that agreed home
I can’t remember them

and came home to rewind inflections
stopping in the middle

So I find myself at home
by the private preambles

home stays brought loyal
the people in home form

that agreed home to people
that agreed to one the people

home rest form to ourselves 
the people in own form

So I found myself at home
the prospects being seen by me

at home brought into private
The prospect of seeing healthily 

at home visions can be attainable
So I presume the offers already

So I presume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home
presume the offers at 

and came home to rewind
before I act on them

and come home to remind inflections
stepping off in to the middle
