('home', 'here')

at home brought into privacy
The prospects there already

promoting from home to a new job
there was no walking along

promoting from home
where you can earn more 

from home
there wasnâ€™t any television 

that agreed home
The offers there already

at home brought into private
traffick is there nonetheless

and came home to rewind inflections
