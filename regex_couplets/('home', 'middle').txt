('home', 'middle')

at home brought into privacy
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

promoting from home to a new job
stopping in the middle

So I find myself at home
stepping in the middle

at home visions can be attainable
stepping off into the middle

and came home to rewind inflections
stepping off in to the middle
