('home', 'offer')

at home brought into privacy
in the form filled offered in trust

that agreed home
I assume the offers reliable

and came home to rewind inflections
So I presume the offers already

So I find myself at home
in track as offer asked 

So I found myself at home
The offers there already

at home brought into private
I presume the offers

at home visions can be attainable
I offer to you

So I presume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home
presume the offers at 

and came home to rewind
Or can have seen offering possession

and come home to remind inflections
seen having or offering possession
