('home', 'possession')

at home brought into privacy
I speak to them my possessions

that agreed home
possessions

and came home to rewind inflections
phrase them of our possessions

home stays brought loyal
phrase them of my possessions

So I find myself at home
Or can have seen offering possession

and come home to remind inflections
seen having or offering possession
