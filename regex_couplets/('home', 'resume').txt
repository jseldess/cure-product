('home', 'resume')

at home brought into privacy
and canâ€™t presume to need

promoting from home to a new job
I resume unassimilable visions

that agreed home
So I presume the offers already

So I find myself at home
I presume the offers

So I found myself at home
So I resume the offers already

at home visions can be attainable
So I presume the offers

So I presume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home
I resume at home

and came home to rewind inflections
I presume to others

and come home to remind inflections
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
