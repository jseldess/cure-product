('home', 'step')

at home brought into privacy
I step off the edge

promoting from home to a new job
step in by the prospect

that agreed home
phase decision step in

So I find myself at home
stepping in the middle

at home visions can be attainable
stepping off into the middle

and came home to rewind inflections
stepping off in to the middle
