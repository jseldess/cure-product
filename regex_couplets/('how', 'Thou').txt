('how', 'Thou')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Though there are quarters goals

how can I know without direction
Though how can you know without direction

for how can you know without direction
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

who knows how to turn it off
Though we are waiting for her
