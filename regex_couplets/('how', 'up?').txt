('how', 'up?')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

how can I know without direction
for how can I know without direction

Though how can you know without direction
though there are quarters with goals

for how can you know without direction
slow asynchronous

who knows how to turn it off
Though we are waiting for her
