('impulse', 'so')

impulse control
or an available resource

I send and retrieve the impulse
sound inundated for my own purchases

I stand and retrieve the impulse
and sound redundant

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
firing and connecting somewhere

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
by in the sound privacy

the impulse my own prospects
also didnâ€™t really move
