('impulse', 'Thou')

impulse control
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

I send and retrieve the impulse
Though we are waiting for her

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
Though we are breaking 

I stand and retrieve the impulse
Though we are waiting 

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
