('impulse', 'though')

impulse control
I had nightmares though

I send and retrieve the impulse
I thought

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
after though thereâ€™s no memory

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
I answered what I thought

I stand and retrieve the impulse
I answered what I thought about
