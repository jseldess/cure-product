('impulse', 'agreed')

impulse control
and to which I’ve agreed

I send and retrieve the impulse
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
and for which the plan agreed

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
that agreed one of rest

I stand and retrieve the impulse
that agreed home
