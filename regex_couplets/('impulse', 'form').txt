('impulse', 'form')

impulse control
Toward the start informally given my reasons

I send and retrieve the impulse
A way formerly like this one

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
already formely a long time

I stand and retrieve the impulse
in the form filled offered in trust

the impulse my own prospects
already formerly a long time

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
dawn formerly

the impulse for my own prospects
drawn formerly rights ending themselves
