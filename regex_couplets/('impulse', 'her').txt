('impulse', 'her')

impulse control
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

I send and retrieve the impulse
where I send and relive aside

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
where I stand and relive

the impulse for my own prospects
where I end

the impulse for my own purposes
where I stand aside

the impulse to my purpose
where I stand and retrieve

aside the impulse to my purpose
where I stand aside and retrieve

I stand and retrieve the impulse
Where in me did I last

the impulse my own prospects
where I send and retrieve aside

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
where I send and relive

impulse for my own purchases
where I stand and retrieve relive

the impulse for my own purchases
where I am aside at least
