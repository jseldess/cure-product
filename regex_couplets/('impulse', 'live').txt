('impulse', 'live')

impulse control
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I send and retrieve the impulse
where I send and relive aside

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
where I stand and relive

the impulse for my own prospects
where I stand and retrieve relive

I stand and retrieve the impulse
where I send and relive

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
where I send and retrieve relive

the impulse my own prospects
and relive from burrowed travels
