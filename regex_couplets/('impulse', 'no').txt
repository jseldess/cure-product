('impulse', 'no')

impulse control
in a continuous vertiginous dream

I send and retrieve the impulse
But my not feeling the memory aside

I stand and retrieve the impulse
and other types of tracking technology

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
But my not feeling the memory inside

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
from no one point

the impulse my own prospects
not needing to wait
