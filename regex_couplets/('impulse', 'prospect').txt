('impulse', 'prospect')

impulse control
the impulse for my own prospects

the impulse for my own purposes
the impulse my own prospects

impulse for my own purchases
stopping into the prospect

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
speech that is of by prospects

I send and retrieve the impulse
The prospects there already
