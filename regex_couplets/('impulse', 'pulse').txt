('impulse', 'pulse')

impulse control
I send and retrieve the impulse

I stand and retrieve the impulse
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

the impulse for my own prospects
the impulse for my own purposes

the impulse for my own purchases
the impulse to my purpose

aside the impulse to my purpose
the impulse my own prospects

impulse for my own purchases
I stand and retrieve the impulse around
