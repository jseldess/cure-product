('impulse', 'purchases')

impulse control
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I send and retrieve the impulse
the impulse for my own purchases

the impulse to my purpose
I have entered my purchases

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
sound inundated for my own purchases

I stand and retrieve the impulse
For my own purchases

the impulse my own prospects
impulse for my own purchases

the impulse for my own purposes
