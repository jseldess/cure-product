('impulse', 'purpose')

impulse control
by no ventillation my purpose

I send and retrieve the impulse
the impulse for my own purposes

the impulse for my own purchases
the impulse to my purpose

aside the impulse to my purpose
Where I host my purposes

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
to the other end of my purpose

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
for my own purposes
