('impulse', 'really')

impulse control
When they really take hold of my finger

I send and retrieve the impulse
without really speaking

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
without really breaking

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
without really branding 

I stand and retrieve the impulse
also didn’t really move
