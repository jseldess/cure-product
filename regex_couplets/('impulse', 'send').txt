('impulse', 'send')

impulse control
I send and retrieve the impulse

I stand and retrieve the impulse
where I send and relive aside

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
where I send and retrieve aside

the impulse for my own purposes
where I send and relive would be held

the impulse my own prospects
where I send and relive

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
where I send and retrieve relive

the impulse for my own prospects
where I send and receive
