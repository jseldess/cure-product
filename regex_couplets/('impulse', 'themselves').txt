('impulse', 'themselves')

impulse control
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I send and retrieve the impulse
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

I stand and retrieve the impulse
battery dawn nights blending themselves
