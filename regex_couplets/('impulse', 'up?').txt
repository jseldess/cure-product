('impulse', 'up?')

impulse control
Looking back while I should be sleeping

I send and retrieve the impulse
But my not feeling the memory aside

I stand and retrieve the impulse
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

the impulse for my own prospects
the impulse for my own purposes

the impulse for my own purchases
the impulse to my purpose

aside the impulse to my purpose
Where I host my purposes

the impulse my own prospects
impulse for my own purchases

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
for my own purchases
