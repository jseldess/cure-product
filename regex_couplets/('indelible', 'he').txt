('indelible', 'he')

I reuse indelible tracks 
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I refuse indelible tracts
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I refuse indelible contracts
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I resume indelible tracks
What was the last time

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
up in the television
