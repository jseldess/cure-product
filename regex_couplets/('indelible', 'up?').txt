('indelible', 'up?')

I reuse indelible tracks 
without the long time I was accounting

I refuse indelible tracts
I refuse indelible tracks

I refuse indelible contracts
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I resume indelible tracks
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
up in the television
