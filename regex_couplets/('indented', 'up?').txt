('indented', 'up?')

reflexing indented in my phone
in traversing my circuit

reflexing indented in my moan
sung reflexing

state reflexing indented in my own
lung reflexing

my reflexing indented in my own tongue
tongue reflexing

reflexing indented in my own
the tongue and hands

indented into an own
I have them trust in me

indented in my own
buy in the sound privacy
