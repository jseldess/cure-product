('inter', 'bill')

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
I hear it between bills and stuff

high up in the internet
I can hear it between bills and stuff

Then I saw them interview
billowing in the cloud

my interfaced stand data
the bill my detuning 

aligned or not with my interests
between bills and stuffed animals
