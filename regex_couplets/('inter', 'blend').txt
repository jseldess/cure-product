('inter', 'blend')

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

interjecting on a day ambition
walking into percents blending themselves

Then I saw them interview
where I blend and relive

my interfaced stand data
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

 as points which are my interest
