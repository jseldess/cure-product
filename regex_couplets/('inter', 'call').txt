('inter', 'call')

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
not calling or echoing for once

interjecting on a day ambition
though it was most emphatically that

hold at intervals riding forward
They are called aspirational

with internally regulated climate
Which can be called confidence

Then I saw them interview
to take the call

my interfaced stand data
