('inter', 'earn')

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
in light of learning what we see

interjecting on a day ambition
When we had jobs that were to earn

hold at intervals riding forward
learned without too much difficulty to code

with internally regulated climate
where you can earn more 

Then I saw them interview
decisioned to learn 

my interfaced stand data
I learned my location
