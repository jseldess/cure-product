('inter', 'eat')

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
too sunny to eat ice cream

interjecting on a day ambition
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

way high up in the inter
executive breath

higher up in the internet
execute breath

hold at intervals riding forward
of the habits I create

with internally regulated climate
they create

Then I saw them interview
And from that great distance

my interfaced stand data
