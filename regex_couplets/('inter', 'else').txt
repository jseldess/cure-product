('inter', 'else')

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
If you have confidence regardless all else

hold at intervals riding forward
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

Then I saw them interview
and elsewhere my memory 

my interfaced stand data
By my memory elsewhere

Aligned or not with my interests
in memory elsewhere

I interfaced
but for memory elsewhere

 as points which are my interest
