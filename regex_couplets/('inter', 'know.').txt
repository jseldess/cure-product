('inter', 'know.')

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
who knows the way

interjecting on a day ambition
how can I know without direction

way high up in the inter
I even know what I would find

Then I saw them interview
even when close to my knowing

my interfaced stand data
that their knowing
