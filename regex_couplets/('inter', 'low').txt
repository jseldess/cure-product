('inter', 'low')

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
slow asynchronous

way high up in the inter
low in the content architecture

hold at intervals riding forward
Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture

high up in the internet
I am not allowed to see their face

with internally regulated climate
under pillowing a cloud

Then I saw them interview
