('inter', 'open')

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Before we walk across the wide opening

interjecting on a day ambition
Before anyone walks across the opening

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
my desires were open

hold at intervals riding forward
I wish my desires were open

at intervals while riding forward
The simple act opening surmounted

Then I saw them interview
