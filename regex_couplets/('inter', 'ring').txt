('inter', 'ring')

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
interferring 

interjecting into the stream of pictures
bring your child along

way high up in the inter
ring

hold at intervals riding forward
hovering above standing water

high up in the internet
actually considering the end

Then I saw them interview
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

my interfaced stand data
The prospect for veering healthily
