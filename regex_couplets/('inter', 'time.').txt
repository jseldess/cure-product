('inter', 'time.')

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
only fragments of time with my children

interjecting into the stream
where I sleep at times

way high up in the inter
over the long time up in the sky

higher up in the internet
on the time line I was on

way high up in the internet
over the time line I was on

hold at intervals riding forward
On the timeline I was on

high up in the internet
over the long time I was on

with internally regulated climate
The long time I had a vision

Then I saw them interview
The long time I was a vision

my interfaced stand data
in the long time they were on

I interfaced
time they were on

 as points which are my interest
