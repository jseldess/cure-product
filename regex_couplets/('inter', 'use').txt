('inter', 'use')

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Because it was really dark

interjecting on a day ambition
You use the most essential parts

hold at intervals riding forward
I reuse unassimilable visions

Then I saw them interview
I used my technology

my interfaced stand data
