('inter', 'you.')

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Though how can you know without direction

way high up in the inter
You can hear it also through your leisure

hold at intervals riding forward
That you can see only the back of

with internally regulated climate
your bid to the next highest ranked network

Then I saw them interview
If you have confidence regardless all else

my interfaced stand data
the young ripples inaudibly
