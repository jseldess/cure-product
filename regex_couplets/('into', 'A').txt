('into', 'A')

into rotating directionless 
Arrayed out in such a nested way

into the stream of pictures
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

into the minority proportion of time
Actually one day there is direction

into rotating and directionless space
And as an extension of the values

into a brigand and a murderer
BREAK

into the well controlled climate
Aspirational strategy

into the next level head
ASPIRATING VISIONS

talking into pheasants bending themselves
All that I can think I want

Then I saw into you
COPY DREAM 

entered into my purposes
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

deep into pathways from repeated travels
CONTRACT

stopping into the prospect
A baby and a bear

step by into the prospect
Aligned or not with my interests

into liminal reflexing
2 â€“ PREAMBLE

at home brought into privacy
All that I own messageable

stepping off into the middle
