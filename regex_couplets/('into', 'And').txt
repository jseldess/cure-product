('into', 'And')

into rotating directionless 
And put in place as though stationary

into rotating and directionless space
And as an extension of the values

into a brigand and a murderer
And make myself a visible

into the well controlled climate
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Then I saw into you
