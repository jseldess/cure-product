('into', 'As')

into rotating directionless 
Ask who I am

into the stream of pictures
As though stationary and a destination

into rotating and directionless space
Assimilable or

into the well controlled climate
Aspirational strategy

into the next level head
As an extension of the values

talking into pheasants bending themselves
As a clone, illegally conceived

Then I saw into you
