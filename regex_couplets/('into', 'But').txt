('into', 'but')

into rotating directionless 
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

into the stream of pictures
but not impart cynicism

into a brigand and a murderer
Attributable or

into the well controlled climate
but it continued

talking into pheasants bending themselves
but they are black spots

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
but I can hear them

Then I saw into you
I resume attributable visions

talking into percents bending themselves
attributable visions

entered into my purposes
that decisions can be attributable

converting sight into a purchase
but for memory elsewhere

into liminal reflexing
decisions that can be attributable

at home brought into privacy
revisions that can be attributable

already brought into privacy
but I own all that’s messageable

stepping off into the middle
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
