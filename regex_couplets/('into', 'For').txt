('into', 'For')

into rotating directionless 
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

into a brigand and a murderer
Forecasting the story before dawn

into the well controlled climate
For an ungraspable time

Then I saw into you
For my own purchases

deep into pathways from repeated travels
Formerly a way like this one

stopping into the prospect
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

stepping off into the middle
