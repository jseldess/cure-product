('into', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

into rotating directionless 
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

into the stream of pictures
I’m simply inside

into the minority proportion of time
Right now I’m the cart

into a brigand and a murderer
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

into the well controlled climate
where I’m watching my tv

into liminal reflexing
