('into', 'if')

into rotating directionless 
drifting away

into the stream of pictures
if not directly on my skin

into the minority proportion of time
drifting does not feel an exception

into a brigand and a murderer
if he had not carried one virtue 

into the well controlled climate
That company creates a life

talking into pheasants bending themselves
If I take a different measure

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
If I take some different measure

Then I saw into you
if there is anything 

entered into my purposes
if that has anything

stopping into the prospect
if only on the way to the trash

already brought into privacy
