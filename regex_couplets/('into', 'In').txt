('into', 'IN')

into rotating directionless 
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

into a brigand and a murderer
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

into the well controlled climate
ASPIRATING VISIONS

talking into pheasants bending themselves
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

Then I saw into you
By NATASHA SINGER

deep into pathways from repeated travels
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

stopping into the prospect
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

step by into the prospect
