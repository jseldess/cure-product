('into', 'It')

into rotating directionless 
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

into the stream of pictures
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

into the minority proportion of time
It has been since

into a brigand and a murderer
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

into the well controlled climate
It’s not marshal exactly

stopping into the prospect
