('into', 'My')

into rotating directionless 
My live connections to you

into the stream of pictures
My associations

talking into pheasants bending themselves
My purpose up in the sky

Then I saw into you
My daughter with her way

stopping into the prospect
My say to the elections

into liminal reflexing
My void

into an own
