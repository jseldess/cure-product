('into', 'so')

into rotating directionless 
I’ll pull myself another personality type

into the stream of pictures
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

into the minority proportion of time
You can hear it also through your leisure

into a brigand and a murderer
A person from a distance

into the well controlled climate
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

talking into pheasants bending themselves
no solid ground to continue along

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
If I take some different measure

Then I saw into you
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

entered into my purposes
sound inundated for my own purchases

deep into pathways from repeated travels
firing and connecting somewhere

stopping into the prospect
so still watch them

step by into the prospect
sizes track for asking sound

converting sight into a purchase
by in the sound privacy

into liminal reflexing
buy in the sound privacy

at home brought into privacy
by in the sounded privacy

already brought into privacy
and could be inflected with reasons

stepping off into the middle
