('into', 'That')

into rotating directionless 
That’s exaclty what I want for them

into the stream of pictures
That is itself not still

into rotating and directionless space
That’s where I sleep at times

into a brigand and a murderer
That’s when they really take

into the well controlled climate
That company creates a life

talking into pheasants bending themselves
That I captured an afterimage

Then I saw into you
That are my right to say

into liminal reflexing
