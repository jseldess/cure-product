('into', 'There')

into rotating directionless 
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

into the stream of pictures
There are quarterly goals

into a brigand and a murderer
There was very little physical activity

talking into pheasants bending themselves
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Then I saw into you
There are spots waiting

entered into my purposes
There are constant ways

stopping into the prospect
