('into', 'Thou')

into rotating directionless 
Though there are quarters goals

into rotating and directionless space
Though how can you know without direction

and then into rotating and directional space
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Though in not many acts

Then I saw into you
Though we are waiting for her

entered into my purposes
Though we are breaking 

deep into pathways from repeated travels
Though we are waiting 

stopping into the prospect
Though we can’t help waiting

step by into the prospect
