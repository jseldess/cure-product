('into', 'though')

into rotating directionless 
As though stationary and a destination

into rotating and directionless space
though there are quarters with goals

and then into rotating and directional space
though it was most emphatically that

into a brigand and a murderer
I had nightmares though

talking into pheasants bending themselves
though not many freeze up

Then I saw into you
I thought

entered into my purposes
though we are still breaking in

deep into pathways from repeated travels
after though thereâ€™s no memory

stopping into the prospect
though we are waiting for her

step by into the prospect
I answered what I thought

into liminal reflexing
