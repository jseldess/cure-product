('into', 'To')

into rotating directionless 
To my children Walt Whitman

into a brigand and a murderer
To neither study

into the well controlled climate
Tomorrow

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

Then I saw into you
To substitute neither study

entered into my purposes
To the ends of transactions

stopping into the prospect
To the ends of my transactions

step by into the prospect
To the right of determined elections

into liminal reflexing
