('into', 'Where')

into rotating directionless 
Where I sleep at times

into the stream of pictures
Where official policy is to catch and release

into the well controlled climate
Where I take my liesure

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Where I lead gravity

Then I saw into you
Where I host my purposes

entered into my purposes
Where in me did I last

deep into pathways from repeated travels
Where in me did I host

stopping into the prospect
Where in me did I lose

step by into the prospect
