('into', 'Which')

into rotating directionless 
Which is a measure to never live out

into a brigand and a murderer
Which can be called confidence

into the well controlled climate
Which is a pleasure to never live out

Then I saw into you
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

stopping into the prospect
