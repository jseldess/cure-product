('into', 'about')

into rotating directionless 
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

into the stream of pictures
burrowed about from repeated travels

deep into pathways from repeated travels
and literally moved about

stopping into the prospect
answered about 

step by into the prospect
I answered about

into liminal reflexing
