('into', 'across')

into rotating directionless 
Before we walk across the wide field

into the stream of pictures
Before we walk across the wide opening

into the minority proportion of time
across the retinas

talking into pheasants bending themselves
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

Then I saw into you
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

stepping off into the middle
