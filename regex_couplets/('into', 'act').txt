('into', 'act')

into rotating directionless 
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

into the stream of pictures
One day was actually

into rotating and directionless space
I was enjoined to act again myself

into a brigand and a murderer
I was enjoined to act again

into the well controlled climate
Not goals or tactics

into the next level head
and strategies not tactics

talking into pheasants bending themselves
actually considering the end

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
I refuse indelible tracts

Then I saw into you
we had inhabited actually

entered into my purposes
The ends of my transactions

deep into pathways from repeated travels
to the ends of my transactions

stopping into the prospect
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

step by into the prospect
to the ends of actions

converting sight into a purchase
I turn not sad exactly

into liminal reflexing
before I act on them

at home brought into privacy
