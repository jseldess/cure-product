('into', 'actions')

into rotating directionless 
conversations with our reactions

into the stream of pictures
to the ends of my transactions

Then I saw into you
The ends of my transactions

deep into pathways from repeated travels
To the ends of transactions

stopping into the prospect
to the ends of actions

step by into the prospect
