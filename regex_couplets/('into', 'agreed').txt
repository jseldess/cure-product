('into', 'agreed')

into rotating directionless 
and to which I’ve agreed

Then I saw into you
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

deep into pathways from repeated travels
and for which the plan agreed

stopping into the prospect
and to which the plan agreed

step by into the prospect
that agreed one of rest

converting sight into a purchase
that agreed home

at home brought into privacy
that agreed to one the people

already brought into privacy
