('into', 'along')

into rotating directionless 
bring your child along

into a brigand and a murderer
The days lined along company

talking into pheasants bending themselves
there was no walking along the pleasure

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
formerly along time they were on

stopping into the prospect
formerly along my say to the elections

step by into the prospect
along cables

into liminal reflexing
