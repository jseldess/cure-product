('into', 'already')

into rotating directionless 
So I presume the offers already

at home brought into privacy
already brought into privacy

into the stream of pictures
already formerly a long time

Then I saw into you
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

deep into pathways from repeated travels
with dawn already formerly nights 

stopping into the prospect
dawn already formerly nights 

step by into the prospect
The prospects there already

at home brought into private
the offers there already

stepping off into the middle
So I resume the offers already

brought messageable into privacy
I resume the offers at home already

brought into privacy
