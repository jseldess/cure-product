('into', 'also')

into rotating directionless 
You can hear it also through your leisure

into a brigand and a murderer
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I cannot clear it also through investiture

Then I saw into you
also didnâ€™t really move

into liminal reflexing
