('into', 'answer')

into rotating directionless 
for the duration of the answer

deep into pathways from repeated travels
the duration of answers

stopping into the prospect
answered about 

step by into the prospect
I answered what I thought

converting sight into a purchase
I answered about

into liminal reflexing
