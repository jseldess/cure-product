('into', 'any')

into rotating directionless 
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

into the stream of pictures
at any time it can drift again

into a brigand and a murderer
Or the company

into the well controlled climate
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

talking into pheasants bending themselves
there wasn’t any television 

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
not many face up

Then I saw into you
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

entered into my purposes
They have very many choices

deep into pathways from repeated travels
latency which doesn’t mean anything

stopping into the prospect
if there is anything 

step by into the prospect
The many transparent pixel calls

converting sight into a purchase
or imagined anyway

into liminal reflexing
