('into', 'are')

into rotating directionless 
Though there are quarters goals

into rotating and directionless space
there are quarters 

and then into rotating and directional space
who are so fresh and agile

into a brigand and a murderer
barely outlines

into the well controlled climate
They are called aspirational

into the next level head
The days are long

talking into pheasants bending themselves
but they are black spots

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
There are spots waiting

Then I saw into you
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

deep into pathways from repeated travels
Though we are waiting 

stopping into the prospect
Though we are waiting for her

step by into the prospect
There are constant ways

converting sight into a purchase
That are my right to say

into liminal reflexing
careening between the preambles

stepping off into the middle
