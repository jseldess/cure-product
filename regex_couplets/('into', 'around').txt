('into', 'around')

into rotating directionless 
Spinning around the heart

into the well controlled climate
around my country 

Then I saw into you
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

entered into my purposes
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

deep into pathways from repeated travels
and around redundant

stopping into the prospect
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

step by into the prospect
