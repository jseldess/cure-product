('into', 'aside')

into rotating directionless 
aside from the retinas

talking into pheasants bending themselves
But my not feeling the memory aside

entered into my purposes
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

deep into pathways from repeated travels
where I am aside

stopping into the prospect
where I send and relive aside

into liminal reflexing
