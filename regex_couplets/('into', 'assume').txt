('into', 'assume')

into rotating directionless 
I assumed it was visible

into the stream of pictures
I assumed 

Then I saw into you
I assumed what I draw

stopping into the prospect
I assume the offers reliable

at home brought into privacy
I assume the offers revisitable

stepping off into the middle
I assumed that they were divisible
