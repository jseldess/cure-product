('into', 'at')

into rotating directionless 
But that is beside the point

into the stream of pictures
at home brought into privacy

already brought into privacy
by the private preambles

into the minority proportion of time
variegated reflected light

interjecting into the stream
and at my desk

into rotating and directionless space
and then into rotating and directional space

into directionless space
not even rotating

into a brigand and a murderer
attesting this is a chance

into the well controlled climate
they create

into the next level head
They are called aspirational

talking into pheasants bending themselves
What would I feel without that goal

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
What I do in my liesure

Then I saw into you
for an explicit state

talking into percents bending themselves
like flattening sleep 

wearing trying talking into it
like state mirror

walking into percents blending themselves
battery dawn nights blending themselves

talking into the sense
in the sense of watching

entered into my purposes
data collection on users

deep into pathways from repeated travels
the duration of answers

stopping into the prospect
I designated 

step by into the prospect
that is by possessed

converting sight into a purchase
the way was water

into liminal reflexing
state kept owned impression

at home brought into private
revisions that can be attributable

stepping off into the middle
at home visions can be attainable

brought messageable into privacy
brought into private messageably

brought into privacy
I resume the offers at home
