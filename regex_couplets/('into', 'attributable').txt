('into', 'attributable')

into rotating directionless 
I resume attributable visions

talking into pheasants bending themselves
attributable visions

Then I saw into you
that decisions can be attributable

converting sight into a purchase
decisions that can be attributable

at home brought into privacy
revisions that can be attributable

already brought into privacy
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

stepping off into the middle
