('into', 'bill')

into rotating directionless 
between bills and stuffed animals

into the stream of pictures
I hear it between bills and stuff

into the well controlled climate
I can hear it between bills and stuff

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

Then I saw into you
billowing in the cloud

talking into percents bending themselves
until the bill came

entered into my purposes
the bill my detuning 

into liminal reflexing
bills and stuffed animals

at home brought into privacy
