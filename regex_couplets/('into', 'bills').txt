('into', 'bills')

into rotating directionless 
between bills and stuffed animals

into the stream of pictures
I hear it between bills and stuff

into the well controlled climate
I can hear it between bills and stuff

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

Then I saw into you
bills and stuffed animals

at home brought into privacy
