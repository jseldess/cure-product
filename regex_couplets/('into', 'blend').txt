('into', 'blend')

into rotating directionless 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

into the stream of pictures
walking into percents blending themselves

walking into percents
where I blend and relive

stopping into the prospect
where lights blended themselves

step by into the prospect
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

into liminal reflexing
