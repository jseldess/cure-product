('into', 'brought')

into rotating directionless 
at home brought into privacy

already brought into privacy
brought messageable to you

into the stream of pictures
I brought my head down

into the well controlled climate
own stays brought loyal

stopping into the prospect
own that stays brought loyal

step by into the prospect
that stays brought loyal

converting sight into a purchase
home stays brought loyal

at home brought into private
brought messageable into privacy

brought into private messageably
brought into privacy

stepping off into the middle
