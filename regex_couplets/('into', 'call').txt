('into', 'call')

into rotating directionless 
not calling or echoing for once

into the stream of pictures
though it was most emphatically that

into a brigand and a murderer
Which can be called confidence

into the well controlled climate
They are called aspirational

into the next level head
to take the call

deep into pathways from repeated travels
The many transparent pixel calls

stopping into the prospect
recalling aside

into liminal reflexing
