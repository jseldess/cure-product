('into', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

into rotating directionless 
I can’t fix them without direction

into rotating and directionless space
and can’t presume to need

into a brigand and a murderer
That can’t be glimpsed

into the well controlled climate
Though we can’t help waiting

stopping into the prospect
I can’t remember them

into liminal reflexing
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

stepping off into the middle
