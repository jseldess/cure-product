('into', 'cannot')

into rotating directionless 
Then I cannot see face value

into the stream of pictures
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I cannot clear it also through investiture

Then I saw into you
in that I cannot remember 

at home brought into privacy
