('into', 'children')

into rotating directionless 
On a snow day with my children

into the stream of pictures
my childrenâ€™s consumption

into the minority proportion of time
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

into a brigand and a murderer
Even the children

Then I saw into you
my possession of my children

stopping into the prospect
speech my possession of my children

step by into the prospect
