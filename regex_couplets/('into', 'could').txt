('into', 'could')

into rotating directionless 
and could be mapped and weighed

into the well controlled climate
until I could not tire 

talking into pheasants bending themselves
until I could not be tired

Then I saw into you
until I could not be hired

talking into percents bending themselves
I could in effect credit

entered into my purposes
and could be inflected with reasons

at home brought into privacy
