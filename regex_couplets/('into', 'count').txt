('into', 'count')

into rotating directionless 
Then I constellate my time family country

into the stream of pictures
So I constellate the time family country

into a brigand and a murderer
I brought my count down

into the well controlled climate
without the long time I was accounting

talking into pheasants bending themselves
the simple act of honoring an accountant

Then I saw into you
without the long time I was on accounting

talking into percents bending themselves
More reasons around my country 

entered into my purposes
