('into', 'data')

into rotating directionless 
I’ll pull my data higher up

into a brigand and a murderer
I’ll pull my data

into the well controlled climate
The days of private data

talking into pheasants bending themselves
trackers collecting data on users

entered into my purposes
data collection on users

deep into pathways from repeated travels
my interfaced stand data

into liminal reflexing
