('into', 'daughter')

into rotating directionless 
I love my daughter still

talking into pheasants bending themselves
with my daughter

stopping into the prospect
my daughter will learn 

converting sight into a purchase
My daughter with her way

step by into the prospect
my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me

into liminal reflexing
