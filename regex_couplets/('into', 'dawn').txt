('into', 'dawn')

into rotating directionless 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

into the stream of pictures
Forecasting the story before dawn

into the well controlled climate
dawn already formerly nights 

Then I saw into you
dawn formerly

deep into pathways from repeated travels
with dawn already formerly nights 

stopping into the prospect
battery dawn nights 

step by into the prospect
battery dawn nights ending themselves

into liminal reflexing
