('into', 'day')

into rotating directionless 
On a snow day with my children

into the stream of pictures
One day there is direction

into the minority proportion of time
on a day there will be direction

interjecting into the stream
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

interjecting into the stream of pictures
One day was actually

into rotating and directionless space
I argued the days felt longer

into the well controlled climate
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

talking into pheasants bending themselves
The day

Then I saw into you
at least most days

into liminal reflexing
