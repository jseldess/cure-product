('into', 'decision')

into rotating directionless 
the planning process for decisions

into the well controlled climate
attributable decisions

Then I saw into you
forgetting decisions 

stopping into the prospect
decisioned to learn 

step by into the prospect
that decisions can be attributable

converting sight into a purchase
decisioned to learn back

deep into pathways from repeated travels
decisions that can be attributable

at home brought into privacy
decisioned by the prospect

already brought into privacy
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

stepping off into the middle
