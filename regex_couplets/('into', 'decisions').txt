('into', 'decisions')

into rotating directionless 
the planning process for decisions

into the well controlled climate
attributable decisions

Then I saw into you
forgetting decisions 

stopping into the prospect
that decisions can be attributable

converting sight into a purchase
decisions that can be attributable

at home brought into privacy
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

stepping off into the middle
