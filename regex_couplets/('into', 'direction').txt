('into', 'direction')

into rotating directionless 
Whereas direction is beside the point

into the stream of pictures
Of course there is a direction

into the minority proportion of time
on a day there will be direction

interjecting into the stream
One day there is direction

into rotating and directionless space
Though how can you know without direction

and then into rotating and directional space
for how can you know without direction

into directionless space
stopping off in all directions

stepping off into the middle
