('into', 'do')

into rotating directionless 
The dogs and lillies

into the stream of pictures
in a sharp downward turn 

into the minority proportion of time
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

interjecting into the stream
does not feel an exception

into a brigand and a murderer
I brought my head down

into the well controlled climate
What I do in my liesure

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Undoubtedly 

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I walk up and don’t work anymore

Then I saw into you
here is the site of the battle of maldon

entered into my purposes
and it doesn’t take long

deep into pathways from repeated travels
latency which doesn’t mean anything

stopping into the prospect
I only think I don’t listen

stepping off into the middle
