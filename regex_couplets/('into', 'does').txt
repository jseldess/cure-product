('into', 'does')

into rotating directionless 
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

into the stream of pictures
does not feel an exception

into a brigand and a murderer
and it doesn’t take long

deep into pathways from repeated travels
latency which doesn’t mean anything

stopping into the prospect
