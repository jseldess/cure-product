('into', 'down')

into rotating directionless 
in a sharp downward turn 

into the stream of pictures
In a sharp downard turn

into the minority proportion of time
to the down arrow

into a brigand and a murderer
I brought my head down

into the well controlled climate
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

Then I saw into you
