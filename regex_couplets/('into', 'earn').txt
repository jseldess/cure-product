('into', 'earn')

into rotating directionless 
in light of learning what we see

into the stream of pictures
When we had jobs that were to earn

into a brigand and a murderer
I spend time online learning to code

into the well controlled climate
where you can earn more 

talking into pheasants bending themselves
decisioned to learn 

stopping into the prospect
decisioned to learn back

step by into the prospect
my daughter will learn 

converting sight into a purchase
phase decision for learning

deep into pathways from repeated travels
I learned my location

into liminal reflexing
for learning by the prospect

at home brought into privacy
