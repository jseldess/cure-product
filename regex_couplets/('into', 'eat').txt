('into', 'eat')

into rotating directionless 
too sunny to eat ice cream

into the stream of pictures
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

into a brigand and a murderer
was not just a defeat

into the well controlled climate
they create

into the next level head
of the habits they create.

talking into pheasants bending themselves
it was not just a defeat

Then I saw into you
And from that great distance

entered into my purposes
for the creation of the universe

deep into pathways from repeated travels
burrowed about from repeated travels

into liminal reflexing
