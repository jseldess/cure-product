('into', 'edge')

into rotating directionless 
I step off the edge

into the stream of pictures
off the edge of the world

into the minority proportion of time
Face falling off the edge of the face

interjecting into the stream
The edge is put in place

into rotating and directionless space
I step over the edge

and then into rotating and directional space
If I step over the edge

into directionless space
value falling off the edge of the face

into a brigand and a murderer
Falling off the edge of the face

into the well controlled climate
and testing the edge and gravity

into the next level head
