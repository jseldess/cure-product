('into', 'else')

into rotating directionless 
If you have confidence regardless all else

into the well controlled climate
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

Then I saw into you
and elsewhere my memory 

entered into my purposes
elsewhere my purposes

deep into pathways from repeated travels
elsewhere by my memory

stopping into the prospect
By my memory elsewhere

into liminal reflexing
