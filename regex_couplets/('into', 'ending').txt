('into', 'ending')

into rotating directionless 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

into the stream of pictures
I tried to feel the key values extending 

into the well controlled climate
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
talking into percents bending themselves

wearing trying talking into it
walking into percents blending themselves

walking into percents
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

deep into pathways from repeated travels
battery dawn nights ending themselves

into liminal reflexing
