('into', 'enter')

into rotating directionless 
I have entered my phone

into the stream of pictures
The sun high enough to enter directly 

Then I saw into you
I enter the flattening mirror

talking into percents bending themselves
I have entered my purposes

entered into my purposes
I had entered my phone

into liminal reflexing
