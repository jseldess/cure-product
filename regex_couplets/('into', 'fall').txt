('into', 'fall')

into rotating directionless 
Then fall then summer from my face

into the stream of pictures
Then fall then summer

into a brigand and a murderer
and not falling at all

into the well controlled climate
falling off the encoded end

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I take it out in the snow fall

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
