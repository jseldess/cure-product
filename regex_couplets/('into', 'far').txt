('into', 'far')

into rotating directionless 
as far as I can see

into the stream of pictures
as far back as my history heard

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
for to tire as far back as my history

talking into percents bending themselves
in welfare and hope

into liminal reflexing
