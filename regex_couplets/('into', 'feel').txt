('into', 'feel')

into rotating directionless 
conversations with our feelings

into the stream of pictures
does not feel an exception

into a brigand and a murderer
I tried to feel the key values extending 

into the well controlled climate
I tried to feel the extension of key values

into the next level head
when trying to feel the extension of key values

talking into pheasants bending themselves
What would I feel without that goal

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
But my not feeling the memory aside

entered into my purposes
But my not feeling the memory inside

deep into pathways from repeated travels
which feels most comfortable

stopping into the prospect
which feels more comfortable

step by into the prospect
By my feeling the memory inside

converting sight into a purchase
which I feel formerly about for

into liminal reflexing
