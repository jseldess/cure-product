('into', 'feeling')

into rotating directionless 
conversations with our feelings

into the stream of pictures
But my not feeling the memory aside

entered into my purposes
But my not feeling the memory inside

deep into pathways from repeated travels
By my feeling the memory inside

stopping into the prospect
But my feeling the memory aside

into liminal reflexing
