('into', 'form')

into rotating directionless 
There are performance reviews

into a brigand and a murderer
Toward the start informally given my reasons

Then I saw into you
already formerly a long time

entered into my purposes
A way formerly like this one

deep into pathways from repeated travels
in the form filled offered in trust

stopping into the prospect
dawn already formerly nights 

step by into the prospect
formerly a way

converting sight into a purchase
which I feel formerly about for

into liminal reflexing
own best form

at home brought into privacy
own best form to ourselves

already brought into privacy
