('into', 'from')

into rotating directionless 
Then fall then summer from my face

into the stream of pictures
Falling from this distance

into a brigand and a murderer
A person from a distance

into the well controlled climate
aside from the retinas

talking into pheasants bending themselves
from which to step off

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
I get from here through there

Then I saw into you
breaking from my constituents

deep into pathways from repeated travels
from my constituents

stopping into the prospect
from no one point

into liminal reflexing
