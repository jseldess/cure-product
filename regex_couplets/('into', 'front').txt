('into', 'front')

into rotating directionless 
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

into the stream of pictures
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

into the well controlled climate
in front of the set of regulations

talking into pheasants bending themselves
And need out in front purchase

Then I saw into you
behind or out front or up above

into liminal reflexing
