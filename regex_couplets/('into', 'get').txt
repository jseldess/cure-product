('into', 'get')

into rotating directionless 
I’ll get there eventually

into the stream of pictures
and is relentlessly budgeted

into a brigand and a murderer
I’ll get there ruins

into the well controlled climate
I get through there

Then I saw into you
forgetting decisions 

stopping into the prospect
forgettable

stepping off into the middle
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

converting sight into a purchase
and maybe forgettable
