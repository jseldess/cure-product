('into', 'goal')

into rotating directionless 
Though there are quarters goals

into rotating and directionless space
We can wrestle them with their goals

and then into rotating and directional space
and without quartely goals

into a brigand and a murderer
before morning goals

into the well controlled climate
Not goals or tactics

into the next level head
not goals

talking into pheasants bending themselves
What would I feel without that goal

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
