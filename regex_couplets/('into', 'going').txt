('into', 'going')

into rotating directionless 
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

into the stream of pictures
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

talking into pheasants bending themselves
The way that she is going

deep into pathways from repeated travels
The way that I am going

stopping into the prospect
