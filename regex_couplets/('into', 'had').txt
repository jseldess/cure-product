('into', 'had')

into rotating directionless 
If he had not carried one virtue

into a brigand and a murderer
I had me a vision

into the well controlled climate
Since I had to hold the entire company

talking into pheasants bending themselves
The long time I had a vision

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
I had a vision

talking into percents bending themselves
we had to say goodbye

Then I saw into you
in the face that I had

deep into pathways from repeated travels
which had on honor to be told

stopping into the prospect
in the space that it had

step by into the prospect
I had entered my phone

into liminal reflexing
