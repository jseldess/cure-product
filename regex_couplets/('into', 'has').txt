('into', 'has')

into rotating directionless 
conversations with our purchase

into the stream of pictures
It has been since

into a brigand and a murderer
in traversing my purchase

talking into pheasants bending themselves
purchased out

Then I saw into you
the impulse for my own purchases

entered into my purposes
washed my purchases

deep into pathways from repeated travels
if that has anything

stopping into the prospect
phase decisioned by the prospect

step by into the prospect
converting sight into a purchase

into liminal reflexing
phase decisioned

at home brought into privacy
