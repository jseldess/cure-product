('into', 'have')

into rotating directionless 
Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning

into the stream of pictures
I have entered my phone

into the minority proportion of time
if you have providence to excess

into a brigand and a murderer
If you have confidence regardless all else

into the well controlled climate
I have them lost

Then I saw into you
if you have providence

entered into my purposes
They have very many choices

deep into pathways from repeated travels
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

stopping into the prospect
I have turned it off

step by into the prospect
I have them trust in me

into liminal reflexing
I have seen more than I can remember

converting sight into a purchase
Or can have seen offering possession

stepping off into the middle
can have seen offering possession
