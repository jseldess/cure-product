('into', 'he')

into rotating directionless 
into the stream of pictures

into the minority proportion of time
The sun isn’t up 

at home brought into privacy
The prospects there already

interjecting into the stream
interjecting into the stream of pictures

into rotating and directionless space
there are quarters 

and then into rotating and directional space
If I step over the edge

into directionless space
what I find there

into a brigand and a murderer
only in the case

into the well controlled climate
I tried to feel the extension of key values

into the next level head
The planning process is for visionaries only

talking into pheasants bending themselves
The long time I had a vision

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
without the long time I was accounting

Then I saw into you
Then I saw them interview

talking into percents bending themselves
which is the long time I was on

wearing trying talking into it
I enter the flattening mirror

walking into percents blending themselves
talking into the cents

talking into the sense
in the sense of watching

entered into my purposes
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

deep into pathways from repeated travels
where I send and relive

stopping into the prospect
Where in me did I host

step by into the prospect
I speak them of my possessions

converting sight into a purchase
the way was water

into liminal reflexing
the tongue and hands

into the mouth
where the tongue rippled

into an oral
the young ripples inaudibly

into an own
I have them lost

already brought into privacy
by the private preambles

at home brought into private
The prospect of seeing healthily 

stepping off into the middle
So I resume the offers already

brought messageable into privacy
I resume the offers at home already

brought into privacy
I resume the offers at home
