('into', 'hear')

into rotating directionless 
You can hear it also through your leisure

into a brigand and a murderer
and my heart rate

into the well controlled climate
I hear it between bills and stuff

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I can hear it between bills and stuff

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
as far back as my history heard

Then I saw into you
In my heart did I lose trust

stopping into the prospect
