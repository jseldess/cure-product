('into', 'here')

into rotating directionless 
Where I sleep at times

into the stream of pictures
The prospects there already

into the minority proportion of time
Of course there is a direction

interjecting into the stream
One day there is direction

into rotating and directionless space
there are quarters 

and then into rotating and directional space
what I find there

into a brigand and a murderer
I’ll get there eventually

into the well controlled climate
there was no promotion

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Where I take my liesure

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
there was no television to hear

Then I saw into you
I get through there

entered into my purposes
elsewhere my purposes

deep into pathways from repeated travels
where I send and relive

stopping into the prospect
Where in me did I host

step by into the prospect
Is there a baby and a bear

converting sight into a purchase
By my memory elsewhere

into liminal reflexing
where the tongue rippled

into an oral
The offers there already

at home brought into private
traffick is there nonetheless

stepping off into the middle
