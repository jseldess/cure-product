('into', 'high')

into rotating directionless 
way high up in the inter

into a brigand and a murderer
higher up in the results

into the well controlled climate
your bid to the next highest ranked network

into the next level head
The sun high enough to enter directly 

Then I saw into you
The sun high enough to strike directly

stepping off into the middle
