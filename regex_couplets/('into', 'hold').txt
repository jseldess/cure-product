('into', 'hold')

into rotating directionless 
I take hold of my finger

into a brigand and a murderer
When they really take hold of my finger

into the well controlled climate
Since I had to hold the entire company

talking into pheasants bending themselves
and hold and wish to hold

Then I saw into you
