('into', 'home')

into rotating directionless 
at home brought into privacy

already brought into privacy
promoting from home to a new job

talking into pheasants bending themselves
that agreed home

stopping into the prospect
So I find myself at home

at home brought into private
at home visions can be attainable

brought messageable into privacy
I resume the offers at home already

brought into privacy
I resume the offers at home

stepping off into the middle
and came home to rewind inflections

converting sight into a purchase
and come home to remind inflections
