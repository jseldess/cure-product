('into', 'inter')

into rotating directionless 
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

into the stream of pictures
interjecting into the stream

interjecting into the stream of pictures
way high up in the inter

into a brigand and a murderer
hold at intervals riding forward

into the well controlled climate
with internally regulated climate

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Then I saw them interview

talking into percents bending themselves
my interfaced stand data

into liminal reflexing
