('into', 'isn\xe2\x80\x99t')

into rotating directionless 
The sun isn’t up 

into the stream of pictures
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

into the minority proportion of time
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

interjecting into the stream
The edge isn’t even there

into rotating and directionless space
Then the sun isn’t available

into a brigand and a murderer
Then the sun isn’t up

into the well controlled climate
