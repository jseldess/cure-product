('into', 'just')

into rotating directionless 
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

into the stream of pictures
Theyâ€™re just not mine

into rotating and directionless space
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

into a brigand and a murderer
was not just a defeat

into the well controlled climate
it was not just a defeat

Then I saw into you
