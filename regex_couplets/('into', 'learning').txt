('into', 'learning')

into rotating directionless 
in light of learning what we see

into the stream of pictures
I spend time online learning to code

into the well controlled climate
phase decision for learning

step by into the prospect
for learning by the prospect

stopping into the prospect
a precision for learning

at home brought into privacy
