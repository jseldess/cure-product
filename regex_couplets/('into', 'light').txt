('into', 'light')

into rotating directionless 
variegated reflected light

into the stream of pictures
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

into the minority proportion of time
stopped light with validated fields

stopping into the prospect
where lights blended themselves

step by into the prospect
stopped light with validated faces

deep into pathways from repeated travels
