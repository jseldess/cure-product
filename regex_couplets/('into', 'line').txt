('into', 'line')

into rotating directionless 
on the time line I was on

into a brigand and a murderer
I spend time online learning to code

into the well controlled climate
The days lined along company

talking into pheasants bending themselves
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

deep into pathways from repeated travels
Choose a line

at home brought into privacy
