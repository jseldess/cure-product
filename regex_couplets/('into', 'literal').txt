('into', 'literal')

into rotating directionless 
and literally moved

Then I saw into you
as it was designed literally

deep into pathways from repeated travels
and literally unproved

stopping into the prospect
and literally moved about

step by into the prospect
not literally moved about

into liminal reflexing
