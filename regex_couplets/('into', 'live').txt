('into', 'live')

into rotating directionless 
I upend live connections to you

into the stream of pictures
Which is a measure to never live out

into a brigand and a murderer
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Which is a pleasure to never live out

Then I saw into you
where I send and relive aside

entered into my purposes
where I send and relive would be held

deep into pathways from repeated travels
where I send and relive

stopping into the prospect
where I stand and relive

into liminal reflexing
