('into', 'man')

into rotating directionless 
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

into the stream of pictures
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

into a brigand and a murderer
not many face up

talking into pheasants bending themselves
though not many facts up in the sky

Then I saw into you
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

entered into my purposes
They have very many choices

deep into pathways from repeated travels
and that man comes on to tell me 

stopping into the prospect
The many transparent pixel calls

step by into the prospect
