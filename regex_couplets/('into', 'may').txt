('into', 'may')

into rotating directionless 
may not be ingrained

talking into pheasants bending themselves
may not be engrained

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

stopping into the prospect
and maybe regrettable 

at home brought into privacy
and maybe forgettable
