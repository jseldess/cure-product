('into', 'me')

into rotating directionless 
into the minority proportion of time

into the stream of pictures
So I presume the offers already

at home brought into privacy
So I find myself at home

already brought into privacy
brought messageable to you

interjecting into the stream
wrestling me to stay still

into rotating and directionless space
Then fall then summer

into a brigand and a murderer
 and time in the train

into the well controlled climate
I had me a vision

talking into pheasants bending themselves
The long time I had a vision

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
I resume unassimilable visions

Then I saw into you
The long time I was a vision

talking into percents bending themselves
without the long time I was accounting

wearing trying talking into it
without the long time I was on accounting

walking into percents blending themselves
If I take a different measure

deep into pathways from repeated travels
But my not feeling the memory aside

stopping into the prospect
Where in me did I host

step by into the prospect
A way formerly like this one

converting sight into a purchase
By my memory elsewhere

into liminal reflexing
I have them trust in me

at home brought into private
I presume the offers

stepping off into the middle
So I resume the offers already

brought messageable into privacy
brought into private messageably

brought into privacy
I resume the offers at home
