('into', 'measure')

into rotating directionless 
Which is a measure to never live out

into a brigand and a murderer
If I take a different measure

talking into pheasants bending themselves
walking along the measure

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
If I take some different measure

Then I saw into you
