('into', 'mine')

into rotating directionless 
Theyâ€™re just not mine

into rotating and directionless space
The third letter from the end is mine

into the well controlled climate
The ads in mine

talking into pheasants bending themselves
To the right of determined elections

into liminal reflexing
