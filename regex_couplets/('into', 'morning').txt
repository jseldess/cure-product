('into', 'morning')

into rotating directionless 
We’ll have coffee this morning

into the stream of pictures
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

into the minority proportion of time
When I woke up in the morning

interjecting into the stream
before morning goals

into the well controlled climate
