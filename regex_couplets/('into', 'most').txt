('into', 'most')

into rotating directionless 
though it was most emphatically that

into a brigand and a murderer
You use the most essential parts

into the well controlled climate
I invited most of what came next

talking into pheasants bending themselves
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

deep into pathways from repeated travels
which feels most comfortable

stopping into the prospect
most comfortable

step by into the prospect
mostly along cables

into liminal reflexing
