('into', 'move')

into rotating directionless 
since I can imagine movement

talking into pheasants bending themselves
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

Then I saw into you
myself moved literally as it is

stopping into the prospect
and literally moved

step by into the prospect
not literally moved about

deep into pathways from repeated travels
also didnâ€™t really move

into liminal reflexing
