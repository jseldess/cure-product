('into', 'moved')

into rotating directionless 
and literally moved

Then I saw into you
myself moved literally as it is

stopping into the prospect
and literally moved about

step by into the prospect
not literally moved about

deep into pathways from repeated travels
not literally moved

into liminal reflexing
