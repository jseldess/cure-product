('into', 'myself')

into rotating directionless 
So I find myself at home

already brought into privacy
I’ll pull myself another personality type

into the stream of pictures
But I can’t let myself treat 

into a brigand and a murderer
I keep turning back again myself

into the well controlled climate
I was enjoined to act again myself

talking into pheasants bending themselves
myself

stopping into the prospect
the least productive of myself

into liminal reflexing
So I found myself at home

at home brought into private
