('into', 'need')

into rotating directionless 
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

into the stream of pictures
and can’t presume to need

into a brigand and a murderer
I need the work

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I need an explicit statement

Then I saw into you
You need history

talking into percents bending themselves
And need out in front purchase

entered into my purposes
not needing to wait

deep into pathways from repeated travels
without really needing

stopping into the prospect
in need one in that best own

step by into the prospect
need one in best own

converting sight into a purchase
that in need one best own

at home brought into privacy
