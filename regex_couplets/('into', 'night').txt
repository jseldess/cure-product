('into', 'night')

into rotating directionless 
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

into the stream of pictures
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

into the minority proportion of time
blue and sun again a second, then night

into the well controlled climate
I had nightmares though

talking into pheasants bending themselves
battery dawn nights blending themselves

talking into the sense
dawn already formerly nights 

Then I saw into you
last night

stopping into the prospect
battery dawn nights 

step by into the prospect
battery dawn nights ending themselves

into liminal reflexing
