('into', 'nights')

into rotating directionless 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

into the stream of pictures
dawn already formerly nights 

Then I saw into you
with dawn already formerly nights 

stopping into the prospect
battery dawn nights 

step by into the prospect
battery dawn nights ending themselves

into liminal reflexing
