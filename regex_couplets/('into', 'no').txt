('into', 'no')

into rotating directionless 
into the minority proportion of time

into the stream of pictures
Then I cannot see face value

interjecting into the stream
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

interjecting into the stream of pictures
They’re just not mine

into rotating and directionless space
Though how can you know without direction

and then into rotating and directional space
or not even rotating

into directionless space
not even rotating

into a brigand and a murderer
if he had not carried one virtue 

into the well controlled climate
increasingly that their economic value

into the next level head
and strategies not tactics

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I take it out in the snow fall

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

Then I saw into you
until I could not be tired

talking into percents bending themselves
even when close to my knowing

entered into my purposes
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

deep into pathways from repeated travels
But my not feeling the memory aside

stopping into the prospect
and it’s not literal

step by into the prospect
But my not feeling the memory inside

converting sight into a purchase
who knows the way

into liminal reflexing
in that I cannot remember 

at home brought into privacy
for a while not to listen

stepping off into the middle
which is not necessarily possible
