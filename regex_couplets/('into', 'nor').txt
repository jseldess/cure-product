('into', 'nor')

into rotating directionless 
into the minority proportion of time

into the stream of pictures
over the long line I would honor

into a brigand and a murderer
nor work in this way daily

into the well controlled climate
the simple act of honoring an accountant

talking into pheasants bending themselves
nor envy honest work

Then I saw into you
which had on honor to be told

stopping into the prospect
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

step by into the prospect
