('into', 'now')

into rotating directionless 
On a snow day with my children

into the stream of pictures
who knows the way

into the minority proportion of time
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

interjecting into the stream of pictures
how can I know without direction

into rotating and directionless space
Though how can you know without direction

and then into rotating and directional space
for how can you know without direction

into directionless space
Right now I’m the cart

into a brigand and a murderer
out in the snow

into the well controlled climate
I take it out in the snow fall

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I even know what I would find

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
even when close to my knowing

Then I saw into you
knowing the constituents

stopping into the prospect
who knows how to turn it off

step by into the prospect
that their knowing

into liminal reflexing
