('into', 'only')

into rotating directionless 
only fragments of time with my children

into the stream of pictures
only in the case

into the well controlled climate
The planning process is for visionaries only

into the next level head
would only willingly break

stopping into the prospect
if only on the way to the trash

already brought into privacy
I only think I donâ€™t listen

stepping off into the middle
