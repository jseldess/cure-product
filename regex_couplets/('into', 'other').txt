('into', 'other')

into rotating directionless 
I’ll pull myself another personality type

into the stream of pictures
others desires

into a brigand and a murderer
On the other hand

talking into pheasants bending themselves
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

Then I saw into you
and other types of tracking technology

entered into my purposes
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

deep into pathways from repeated travels
I presume to others

stopping into the prospect
to the other end

step by into the prospect
Cereal and others’ health

into liminal reflexing
I assume possession to others
