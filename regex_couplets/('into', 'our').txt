('into', 'our')

into rotating directionless 
reasons resources

into the stream of pictures
conversations with our purchase

into the minority proportion of time
You can hear it also through your leisure

into a brigand and a murderer
Two hours and

into the well controlled climate
your bid to the next highest ranked network

into the next level head
with four key value pairs

talking into pheasants bending themselves
or alter of course the time anyway

Then I saw into you
This is your chance

entered into my purposes
Who throws contours away

stopping into the prospect
phrase them of our possessions

at home brought into privacy
own best form to ourselves

step by into the prospect
