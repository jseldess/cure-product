('into', 'over')

into rotating directionless 
I step over the edge

into rotating and directionless space
If I step over the edge

into directionless space
over the long time up in the sky

into a brigand and a murderer
hovering above standing water

into the well controlled climate
oddly grown over with historic bark

into the next level head
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

Then I saw into you
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

entered into my purposes
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

deep into pathways from repeated travels
for not paying sound overwhelmed

stopping into the prospect
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

stepping off into the middle
