('into', 'plan')

into rotating directionless 
and is relentlessly planned

into a brigand and a murderer
The planning process for visions

into the well controlled climate
The planning process is for visionaries only

into the next level head
and for which the plan agreed

stopping into the prospect
and to which the plan agreed

step by into the prospect
