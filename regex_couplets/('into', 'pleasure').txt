('into', 'pleasure')

into rotating directionless 
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

into the stream of pictures
Which is a pleasure to never live out

into a brigand and a murderer
there was no walking along the pleasure

talking into pheasants bending themselves
up in the television pleasure

Then I saw into you
