('into', 'possession')

into rotating directionless 
I speak to them my possessions

stopping into the prospect
my possession of my children

step by into the prospect
I speak them of my possessions

converting sight into a purchase
speech my possession of my children

deep into pathways from repeated travels
I stay the right of my possessions 

into liminal reflexing
phrase them of our possessions

at home brought into privacy
phrase them of my possessions

already brought into privacy
Or can have seen offering possession

stepping off into the middle
seen having or offering possession
