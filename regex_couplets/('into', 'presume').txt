('into', 'presume')

into rotating directionless 
So I presume the offers already

at home brought into privacy
and canâ€™t presume to need

into a brigand and a murderer
I continue to presume

Then I saw into you
I presume to others

stopping into the prospect
I presume the offers

already brought into privacy
So I presume the offers

brought messageable into privacy
presume the offers at 

stepping off into the middle
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
