('into', 'privacy')

into rotating directionless 
at home brought into privacy

already brought into privacy
by in the sound privacy

step by into the prospect
buy in the surrounded privacy

converting sight into a purchase
by in the sounded privacy

stopping into the prospect
bought in the sounded privacy

deep into pathways from repeated travels
buy in the sound privacy

at home brought into private
brought messageable into privacy

brought into private messageably
brought into privacy

stepping off into the middle
