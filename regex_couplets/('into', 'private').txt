('into', 'private')

into rotating directionless 
by the private preambles

into the stream of pictures
The days of private data

talking into pheasants bending themselves
between the private ambles

already brought into privacy
at home brought into private

at home brought into privacy
brought into private messageably

brought into privacy
in that all this in private is messageable

stepping off into the middle
