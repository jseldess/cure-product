('into', 'prospect')

into rotating directionless 
The prospects there already

into the stream of pictures
the impulse for my own prospects

entered into my purposes
the impulse my own prospects

deep into pathways from repeated travels
stopping into the prospect

step by into the prospect
speech that is of by prospects

converting sight into a purchase
decisioned by the prospect

at home brought into privacy
the prospects being seen by me

at home brought into private
The prospect of seeing healthily 

stepping off into the middle
The prospect for careening attached
