('into', 'prospects')

into rotating directionless 
The prospects there already

into the stream of pictures
the impulse for my own prospects

entered into my purposes
the impulse my own prospects

deep into pathways from repeated travels
speech that is of by prospects

step by into the prospect
the prospects being seen by me

at home brought into private
