('into', 'pulse')

into rotating directionless 
impulse control

into the well controlled climate
I send and retrieve the impulse

entered into my purposes
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

deep into pathways from repeated travels
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

stopping into the prospect
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

into liminal reflexing
