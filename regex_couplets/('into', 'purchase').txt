('into', 'purchase')

into rotating directionless 
conversations with our purchase

into the stream of pictures
in traversing my purchase

talking into pheasants bending themselves
purchased out

Then I saw into you
the impulse for my own purchases

entered into my purposes
washed my purchases

deep into pathways from repeated travels
converting sight into a purchase

stopping into the prospect
for my own purchases

into liminal reflexing
