('into', 'purpose')

into rotating directionless 
by no ventillation my purpose

into a brigand and a murderer
until my purpose up in the sky

into the well controlled climate
until I purpose the horizon

talking into percents bending themselves
of my purpose in versing

Then I saw into you
the impulse for my own purposes

entered into my purposes
elsewhere my purposes

deep into pathways from repeated travels
to the other end of my purpose

stopping into the prospect
the impulse to my purpose

into liminal reflexing
