('into', 'really')

into rotating directionless 
because it was really dark

into the stream of pictures
When they really take hold of my finger

into the well controlled climate
without really agreeing

Then I saw into you
without really speaking

deep into pathways from repeated travels
without really branding 

stopping into the prospect
without really needing

step by into the prospect
also didnâ€™t really move

into liminal reflexing
