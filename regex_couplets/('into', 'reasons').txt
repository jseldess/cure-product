('into', 'reasons')

into rotating directionless 
reasons resources

into the stream of pictures
with reasons

into a brigand and a murderer
with little reasons to aspiration

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Toward the start informally given my reasons

Then I saw into you
More reasons around my country 

entered into my purposes
and could be inflected with reasons

at home brought into privacy
