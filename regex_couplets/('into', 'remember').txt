('into', 'remember')

into rotating directionless 
I can’t remember them

into liminal reflexing
in that I cannot remember 

at home brought into privacy
Having seen more than I can remember 

converting sight into a purchase
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

stepping off into the middle
