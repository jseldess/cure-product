('into', 'rest')

into rotating directionless 
wrestling to stay still

into rotating and directionless space
We can wrestle them with their goals

and then into rotating and directional space
that agreed one of rest

stopping into the prospect
Aligned or not with my interests

into liminal reflexing
home rest form to ourselves 

step by into the prospect
