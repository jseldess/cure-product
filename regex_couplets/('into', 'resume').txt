('into', 'resume')

into rotating directionless 
So I presume the offers already

at home brought into privacy
and canâ€™t presume to need

into a brigand and a murderer
I resume unassimilable visions

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I resume indelible tracks

Then I saw into you
I resume attributable visions

talking into percents bending themselves
I continue to presume

entered into my purposes
I presume to others

stopping into the prospect
I presume the offers

already brought into privacy
So I resume the offers already

brought messageable into privacy
I resume the offers at home already

brought into privacy
I resume the offers at home

stepping off into the middle
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
