('into', 'ring')

into rotating directionless 
interferring 

interjecting into the stream of pictures
bring your child along

into a brigand and a murderer
hovering above standing water

into the well controlled climate
actually considering the end

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
the simple act of honoring an accountant

talking into pheasants bending themselves
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

talking into percents bending themselves
wearing trying talking into it

walking into percents blending themselves
storing in surfeit

Then I saw into you
firing and connecting somewhere

stopping into the prospect
The prospect for veering healthily

stepping off into the middle
Or can have seen offering possession
