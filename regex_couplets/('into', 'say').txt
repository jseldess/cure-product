('into', 'say')

into rotating directionless 
we had to say goodbye

Then I saw into you
I ask say in that case

stopping into the prospect
we ask say in that case

step by into the prospect
formerly along my say to the elections

converting sight into a purchase
My say to the elections

into liminal reflexing
I ask say in that phase decisioned

at home brought into privacy
