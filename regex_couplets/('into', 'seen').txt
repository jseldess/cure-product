('into', 'seen')

into rotating directionless 
under the last seen principle

Then I saw into you
Having seen more than 

stopping into the prospect
being seen by me

already brought into privacy
the prospects being seen by me

at home brought into private
Having seen more than I can remember 

converting sight into a purchase
Or can have seen offering possession

stepping off into the middle
seen having or offering possession
