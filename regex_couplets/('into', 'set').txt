('into', 'set')

into rotating directionless 
upset by Gingrich

into a brigand and a murderer
in front of the set afternoon

into the well controlled climate
in front of the set of regulations

talking into pheasants bending themselves
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

Then I saw into you
presets

at home brought into privacy
