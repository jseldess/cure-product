('into', 'side')

into rotating directionless 
But that is beside the point

into the stream of pictures
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

into the minority proportion of time
I’m simply inside

interjecting into the stream
aside from the retinas

talking into pheasants bending themselves
actually considering the end

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
But my not feeling the memory aside

entered into my purposes
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

deep into pathways from repeated travels
where I am aside

stopping into the prospect
by the side of the hosting service

step by into the prospect
But my not feeling the memory inside

converting sight into a purchase
where I send and relive aside

into liminal reflexing
