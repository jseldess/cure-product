('into', 'sight')

into rotating directionless 
In my sight 

talking into pheasants bending themselves
in pursuit of the sight

Then I saw into you
converting sight

stopping into the prospect
my sight hosting

step by into the prospect
converting sight into a purchase

deep into pathways from repeated travels
