('into', 'sky')

into rotating directionless 
over the long time up in the sky

into a brigand and a murderer
Blue sky or

into the well controlled climate
though not many facts up in the sky

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

Then I saw into you
Up in the sky

entered into my purposes
