('into', 'sleep')

into rotating directionless 
Where I sleep at times

into the stream of pictures
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

into the minority proportion of time
So I went back to sleep

interjecting into the stream
That’s where I sleep at times

into a brigand and a murderer
Interrupted sleep or

into the well controlled climate
like flattening sleep 

talking into percents bending themselves
like sleep

talking into the cents
I like sleep

Then I saw into you
