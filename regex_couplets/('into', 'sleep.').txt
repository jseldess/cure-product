('into', 'sleep.')

into rotating directionless 
Where I sleep at times

into the stream of pictures
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

into the minority proportion of time
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

interjecting into the stream
That’s where I sleep at times

into a brigand and a murderer
Interrupted sleep or

into the well controlled climate
like flattening sleep 

talking into percents bending themselves
