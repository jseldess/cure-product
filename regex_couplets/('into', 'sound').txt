('into', 'sound')

into rotating directionless 
sound inundated for my own purchases

deep into pathways from repeated travels
for not paying sound overwhelmed

stopping into the prospect
by in the sound privacy

step by into the prospect
sizes track for asking sound

converting sight into a purchase
by in the sounded privacy

into liminal reflexing
buy in the sound privacy

at home brought into privacy
sizes asking for tracking sound

already brought into privacy
