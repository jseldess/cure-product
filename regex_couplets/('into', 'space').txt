('into', 'space')

into rotating directionless 
in rotating directionless space

into rotating and directionless space
and then into rotating and directional space

into directionless space
in the space that it had

Then I saw into you
though we are breaking in the space that it had

deep into pathways from repeated travels
in the fill space 

into liminal reflexing
