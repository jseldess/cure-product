('into', 'spots')

into rotating directionless 
white spots on a black surface

talking into pheasants bending themselves
but they are black spots

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
black spots on a white surface

Then I saw into you
all the spots

entered into my purposes
