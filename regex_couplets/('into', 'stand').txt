('into', 'stand')

into rotating directionless 
hovering above standing water

into the well controlled climate
I stand and retrieve the impulse

entered into my purposes
where I stand and relive

deep into pathways from repeated travels
where I stand and retrieve and relive

stopping into the prospect
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

step by into the prospect
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

into liminal reflexing
