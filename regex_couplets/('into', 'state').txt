('into', 'state')

into rotating directionless 
explicit statements

talking into pheasants bending themselves
wrapped in static and explicit statements

Then I saw into you
for an explicit state

talking into percents bending themselves
like state mirror

wearing trying talking into it
I swayed a little in my state

entered into my purposes
in my state

into liminal reflexing
state kept owned impression

at home brought into privacy
