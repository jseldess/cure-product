('into', 'stay')

into rotating directionless 
wrestling to stay still

into rotating and directionless space
So stay with us

talking into pheasants bending themselves
own stays brought loyal

stopping into the prospect
own that stays brought loyal

step by into the prospect
that stays brought loyal

converting sight into a purchase
I stay the right of my elections

into liminal reflexing
home stays brought loyal

at home brought into privacy
