('into', 'step')

into rotating directionless 
I step off the edge

into the stream of pictures
I step over the edge

into rotating and directionless space
If I step on the edge

and then into rotating and directional space
If I step over the edge

into directionless space
What the next step

into the well controlled climate
Whatâ€™s the next step

into the next level head
from which to step off

talking into pheasants bending themselves
step in by the prospect

step by into the prospect
phase decision step in

stopping into the prospect
stepping in the middle

stepping off into the middle
stepping off in to the middle
