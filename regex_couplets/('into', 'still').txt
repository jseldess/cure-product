('into', 'still')

into rotating directionless 
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

into the stream of pictures
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

into the minority proportion of time
That is itself not still

into rotating and directionless space
I love my daughter still

talking into pheasants bending themselves
though we are still breaking in

deep into pathways from repeated travels
still wash conserving

stopping into the prospect
