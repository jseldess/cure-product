('into', 'story')

into rotating directionless 
I told her a story, she drew waves.

into the stream of pictures
Forecasting the story before dawn

into the well controlled climate
as far back as my history heard

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
You need history

talking into percents bending themselves
