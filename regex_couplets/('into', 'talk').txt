('into', 'talk')

into rotating directionless 
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

into the well controlled climate
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
talking into percents bending themselves

wearing trying talking into it
talking int

walking into percents blending themselves
talking into the cents

talking into the sense
