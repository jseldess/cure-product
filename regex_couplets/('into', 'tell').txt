('into', 'tell')

into rotating directionless 
Then I constellate my time family country

into the stream of pictures
So I constellate the time family country

into a brigand and a murderer
The CEO tells me to embody values

into the well controlled climate
I had to tell them the news

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I tell you my purposes

Then I saw into you
and that man comes on to tell me 

stopping into the prospect
