('into', 'their')

into rotating directionless 
We can wrestle them with their goals

into rotating and directionless space
We can rest there in them with their goals

and then into rotating and directional space
I am not allowed to see their face

into the well controlled climate
increasingly that their economic value

into the next level head
that their economic value 

talking into pheasants bending themselves
without their agreement

stopping into the prospect
to their other end

step by into the prospect
that their knowing

into liminal reflexing
