('into', 'themselves')

into rotating directionless 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

into the stream of pictures
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
talking into percents bending themselves

wearing trying talking into it
walking into percents blending themselves

walking into percents
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

deep into pathways from repeated travels
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

stopping into the prospect
battery dawn nights ending themselves

into liminal reflexing
