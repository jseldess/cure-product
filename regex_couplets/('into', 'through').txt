('into', 'through')

into rotating directionless 
You can hear it also through your leisure

into a brigand and a murderer
Back up through the results

into the well controlled climate
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I cannot clear it also through investiture

Then I saw into you
I get through there

entered into my purposes
