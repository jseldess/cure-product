('into', 'time.')

into rotating directionless 
Where I sleep at times

into the stream of pictures
Then I constellate my time family country

into the minority proportion of time
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

interjecting into the stream
at any time it can drift again

into a brigand and a murderer
 and time in the train

into the well controlled climate
The long time I had a vision

talking into pheasants bending themselves
without the long time I was accounting

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
So I constellate the time family country

Then I saw into you
The long time I was a vision

talking into percents bending themselves
which is the long time I was on

wearing trying talking into it
without the long time I was on accounting

walking into percents blending themselves
the long time I was on

deep into pathways from repeated travels
until a happier time found

stopping into the prospect
formerly a long time they were on

step by into the prospect
formerly along time they were on

converting sight into a purchase
in the long time they were on

into liminal reflexing
