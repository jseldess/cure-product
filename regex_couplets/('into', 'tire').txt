('into', 'tire')

into rotating directionless 
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

talking into pheasants bending themselves
until I could not tire 

Then I saw into you
for to tire as far back as my history

talking into percents bending themselves
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

entered into my purposes
