('into', 'too.')

into rotating directionless 
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

into the stream of pictures
too sunny to eat ice cream

into the minority proportion of time
emerging this year from too much standing water

into the well controlled climate
Selma knows too 

stopping into the prospect
