('into', 'top')

into rotating directionless 
stopped light with validated variegated fields

into the stream of pictures
stopping into the prospect

step by into the prospect
stopped light with validated fields

converting sight into a purchase
stopped light with validated faces

deep into pathways from repeated travels
stopping in the middle

at home brought into privacy
stopping off in all directions

stepping off into the middle
