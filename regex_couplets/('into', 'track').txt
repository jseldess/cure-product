('into', 'track')

into rotating directionless 
I reuse indelible tracks 

talking into pheasants bending themselves
The first track

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
I refuse indelible tracks

Then I saw into you
and other types of tracking technology

entered into my purposes
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

deep into pathways from repeated travels
which as tracked befitted 

stopping into the prospect
which as tracked befitted phased

step by into the prospect
sizes track for asking sound

converting sight into a purchase
sizes asking for tracking sound

into liminal reflexing
between tracked and buffered

at home brought into privacy
