('into', 'trying')

into rotating directionless 
when trying to feel the extension of key values

into the next level head
that I hear without trying

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
wearing trying talking into it

talking into percents bending themselves
I spun around trying to touch the spots

Then I saw into you
