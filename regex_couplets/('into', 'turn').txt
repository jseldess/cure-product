('into', 'turn')

into rotating directionless 
in a sharp downward turn 

into the stream of pictures
In a sharp downard turn

into the minority proportion of time
sudden downward turn

into a brigand and a murderer
I keep turning back again myself

into the well controlled climate
who knows how to turn it off

stopping into the prospect
I turn not sad exactly

into liminal reflexing
