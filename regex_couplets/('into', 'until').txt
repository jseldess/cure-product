('into', 'until')

into rotating directionless 
until my purpose up in the sky

into a brigand and a murderer
until I could not tire 

talking into pheasants bending themselves
until I could not be tired

Then I saw into you
until I could not be hired

talking into percents bending themselves
until I purpose up in the sky

entered into my purposes
until a happier time found

stopping into the prospect
