('into', 'up?')

into rotating directionless 
into the stream of pictures

into the minority proportion of time
The sun isn’t up 

at home brought into privacy
already brought into privacy

interjecting into the stream
interjecting into the stream of pictures

into rotating and directionless space
there are quarters 

and then into rotating and directional space
for how can you know without direction

into directionless space
slow asynchronous

into a brigand and a murderer
If you have confidence regardless all else

into the well controlled climate
I tried to feel the extension of key values

into the next level head
And as an extension of the values

talking into pheasants bending themselves
without the long time I was accounting

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I resume unassimilable visions

Then I saw into you
You need history

talking into percents bending themselves
I resume attributable visions

wearing trying talking into it
like un

walking into percents blending themselves
If I take a different measure

entered into my purposes
data collection on users

deep into pathways from repeated travels
the duration of answers

stopping into the prospect
in the form filled offered in trust

step by into the prospect
my daughter will learn 

converting sight into a purchase
though we are waiting for her

into liminal reflexing
the tongue and hands

into the mouth
where the tongue rippled

into an oral
the young ripples inaudibly

into an own
I have them trust in me

at home brought into private
So I presume the offers already

stepping off into the middle
So I resume the offers already

brought messageable into privacy
brought into private messageably

brought into privacy
I resume the offers at home
