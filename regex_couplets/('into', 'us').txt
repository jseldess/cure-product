('into', 'us')

into rotating directionless 
I suspend live connections to you

into the stream of pictures
asynchronous 

into the minority proportion of time
because it was really dark

interjecting into the stream
They’re just not mine

into rotating and directionless space
slow asynchronous

into a brigand and a murderer
was not just a defeat

into the well controlled climate
So stay with us

talking into pheasants bending themselves
because there was no solid ground to continue along

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I refuse indelible tracts

Then I saw into you
I have them trust in me

entered into my purposes
data collection on users

deep into pathways from repeated travels
useless for not having paid

stopping into the prospect
in the form filled offered in trust

step by into the prospect
radiating from housing

into liminal reflexing
