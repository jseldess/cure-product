('into', 'use')

into rotating directionless 
because it was really dark

into the stream of pictures
You use the most essential parts

into the well controlled climate
I reuse unassimilable visions

talking into pheasants bending themselves
because there was no solid ground to continue along

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
I refuse indelible tracts

Then I saw into you
I used my technology

entered into my purposes
data collection on users

deep into pathways from repeated travels
useless for not having paid

stopping into the prospect
