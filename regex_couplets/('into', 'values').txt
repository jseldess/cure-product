('into', 'values')

into rotating directionless 
And as an extension of the values

into a brigand and a murderer
The CEO tells me to embody values

into the well controlled climate
I tried to feel the extension of key values

into the next level head
I tried to feel the key values extending 

talking into pheasants bending themselves
