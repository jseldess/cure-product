('into', 'very')

into rotating directionless 
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

into the well controlled climate
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

talking into pheasants bending themselves
They have very many choices

deep into pathways from repeated travels
