('into', 'visible')

into rotating directionless 
I assumed it was visible

into the stream of pictures
Iâ€™ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

into a brigand and a murderer
Divisible or

into the well controlled climate
I assume the offers divisible

at home brought into privacy
that they were divisible

stepping off into the middle
I assumed that they were divisible
