('into', 'vision')

into rotating directionless 
I had me a vision

into the well controlled climate
The planning process for visions

into the next level head
The planning process is for visionaries only

talking into pheasants bending themselves
The long time I had a vision

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I resume unassimilable visions

Then I saw into you
The long time I was a vision

talking into percents bending themselves
I resume attributable visions

wearing trying talking into it
attributable visions

entered into my purposes
there wasn’t any television 

stopping into the prospect
joined in my television

into liminal reflexing
visions that can be attainable

at home brought into privacy
revisions that can be attributable

stepping off into the middle
at home visions can be attainable

brought messageable into privacy
