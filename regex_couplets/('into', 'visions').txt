('into', 'visions')

into rotating directionless 
The planning process for visions

into the well controlled climate
aspirating visions

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I resume unassimilable visions

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
I resume attributable visions

Then I saw into you
attributable visions

entered into my purposes
visions that can be attainable

at home brought into privacy
revisions that can be attributable

stepping off into the middle
at home visions can be attainable

brought messageable into privacy
