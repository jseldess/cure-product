('into', 'wait')

into rotating directionless 
There are spots waiting

Then I saw into you
Though we are waiting for her

deep into pathways from repeated travels
Though we are waiting 

stopping into the prospect
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

step by into the prospect
not needing to wait

into liminal reflexing
