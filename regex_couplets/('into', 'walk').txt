('into', 'walk')

into rotating directionless 
Before we walk across the wide field

into the stream of pictures
Before we walk across the wide opening

into the minority proportion of time
there was no walking along the pleasure

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

Then I saw into you
walking into percents blending themselves

walking into percents
