('into', 'We')

into rotating directionless 
We’ll have coffee this morning

into the stream of pictures
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

into the minority proportion of time
We can wrestle them with their goals

into rotating and directionless space
We can rest there in them with their goals

and then into rotating and directional space
We had to say goodbye there

Then I saw into you
We ask say in that case

at home brought into privacy
