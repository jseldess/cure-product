('into', 'were')

into rotating directionless 
When we had jobs that were to earn

into a brigand and a murderer
my desires were open

into the well controlled climate
I argued the days were longer

talking into pheasants bending themselves
they were on

Then I saw into you
answered about 

deep into pathways from repeated travels
formerly a long time they were on

stopping into the prospect
by the sight of the hosting answered about

step by into the prospect
I answered what I thought

converting sight into a purchase
I answered about

into liminal reflexing
that they were visible

at home brought into privacy
that they were divisible

stepping off into the middle
I assumed that they were divisible
