('into', 'When')

into rotating directionless 
When I woke up in the morning

into the stream of pictures
When we had jobs that were to earn

into a brigand and a murderer
When they really take hold of my finger

into the well controlled climate
When closed to my knowing

Then I saw into you
When I'm watching my tv 

stopping into the prospect
