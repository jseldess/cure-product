('into', 'will')

into rotating directionless 
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

into the stream of pictures
on a day there will be direction

interjecting into the stream
will not be the same

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
that will spur me on

Then I saw into you
would only willingly break

stopping into the prospect
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

step by into the prospect
my daughter will learn 

converting sight into a purchase
