('into', 'work')

into rotating directionless 
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

into the stream of pictures
nor work in this way daily

into the well controlled climate
your bid to the next highest ranked network

into the next level head
I need the work

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

Then I saw into you
nor envy honest work

entered into my purposes
