('into', 'world')

into rotating directionless 
off the edge of the world

into the stream of pictures
Which can be pronounced to the world

into a brigand and a murderer
off the end of the world

into the well controlled climate
hauling off the end of the world

talking into pheasants bending themselves
falling off the end of the world

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
the opinions in my world

stopping into the prospect
