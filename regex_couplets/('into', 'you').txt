('into', 'You')

into rotating directionless 
You should ask who I am

into the stream of pictures
You can hear it also through your leisure

into a brigand and a murderer
You use the most essential parts

into the well controlled climate
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

talking into pheasants bending themselves
You can hear it also through static leisure

Then I saw into you
You need history

talking into percents bending themselves
You can have seen offering
