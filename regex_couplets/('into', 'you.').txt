('into', 'you.')

into rotating directionless 
Though how can you know without direction

into rotating and directionless space
for how can you know without direction

into directionless space
You can hear it also through your leisure

into a brigand and a murderer
If you have confidence regardless all else

into the well controlled climate
your bid to the next highest ranked network

into the next level head
since you can imagine movement

talking into pheasants bending themselves
where you can earn more 

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
you need history

talking into percents bending themselves
a futile joyous white sun

Then I saw into you
This is your chance

entered into my purposes
the young ripples inaudibly

into an own
