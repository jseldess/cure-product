('into', 'your')

into rotating directionless 
You can hear it also through your leisure

into a brigand and a murderer
May I have your zip code

into the well controlled climate
your bid to the next highest ranked network

into the next level head
This is your voice 

Then I saw into you
This is your chance

entered into my purposes
