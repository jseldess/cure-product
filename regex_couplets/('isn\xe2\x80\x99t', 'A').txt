The sun isn’t up 
Arrayed out in such a nested way

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

The edge isn’t even there
And put in place as though stationary

Then the sun isn’t available
After having been contented

Then the sun isn’t up 
BREAK

but the sun isn’t up
UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
GOALS
