The sun isn’t up 
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
I’m simply inside

The edge isn’t even there
Right now I’m the cart

Then the sun isn’t available
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

Then the sun isn’t up
where I’m watching my tv
