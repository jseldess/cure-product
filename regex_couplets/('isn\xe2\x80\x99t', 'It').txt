The sun isn’t up 
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
It keeps coming down thankfully

The edge isn’t even there
It has been since

Then the sun isn’t available
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

Then the sun isn’t up
It’s morning 

but the sun isn’t up
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
