The sun isn’t up 
On a snow day with my children

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
One day there is direction

The edge isn’t even there
One year or

Then the sun isn’t available
On the bandwidth I was on

Then the sun isn’t up
On the timeline I was on

but the sun isn’t up
On the other hand
