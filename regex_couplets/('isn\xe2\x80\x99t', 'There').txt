('isn\xe2\x80\x99t', 'There')

The sun isn’t up 
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

The edge isn’t even there
There are quarterly goals

Then the sun isn’t available
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Then the sun isn’t up
There was very little physical activity
