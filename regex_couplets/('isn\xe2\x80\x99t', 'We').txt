The sun isn’t up 
We’ll have coffee this morning

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
We can wrestle them with their goals

Then the sun isn’t available
We had to say goodbye there
