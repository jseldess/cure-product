The sun isn’t up 
On a snow day with my children

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
as pure as my children

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
my children’s consumption

The edge isn’t even there
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Then the sun isn’t available
Even the children
