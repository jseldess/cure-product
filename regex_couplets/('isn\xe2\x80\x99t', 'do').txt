The sun isn’t up 
The dogs and lillies

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

The edge isn’t even there
does not feel an exception

Then the sun isn’t available
I brought my head down

Then the sun isn’t up
I brought my qualities down

but the sun isn’t up
What I do in my liesure
