The sun isn’t up 
in a sharp downward turn 

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
In a sharp downard turn

The edge isn’t even there
to the down arrow

Then the sun isn’t available
I brought my head down

Then the sun isn’t up
I brought my qualities down

but the sun isn’t up
I click my zipcode up where it should be down
