The sun isn’t up 
But that is beside the point

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

The edge isn’t even there
Rather it itself is rotating

Then the sun isn’t available
I am first in the office

Then the sun isn’t up 
Did he carry one virtue to excess

but the sun isn’t up
Then I cannot see face value

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
It’s the third letter from the end
