The sun isn’t up 
Where I sleep at times

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
I told her a story, she drew waves.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
Of course there is a direction

The edge isn’t even there
Rather it itself is rotating

Then the sun isn’t available
I’ll get there eventually

Then the sun isn’t up
To neither study

but the sun isn’t up
there was no promotion
