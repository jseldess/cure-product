The sun isn’t up 
Where I sleep at times

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
Of course there is a direction

The edge isn’t even there
Though there are quarters goals

Then the sun isn’t available
I’ll get there eventually

Then the sun isn’t up
Where official policy is to catch and release

but the sun isn’t up
there was no promotion
