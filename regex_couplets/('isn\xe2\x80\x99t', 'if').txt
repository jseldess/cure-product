('isn\xe2\x80\x99t', 'if')

The sun isn’t up 
drifting away

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
if not directly on my skin

The edge isn’t even there
drifting does not feel an exception

Then the sun isn’t available
if you have providence to excess

Then the sun isn’t up
if he had not carried one virtue 

but the sun isn’t up
That company creates a life
