('isn\xe2\x80\x99t', 'inter')

The sun isn’t up 
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

The edge isn’t even there
way high up in the inter

Then the sun isn’t available
hold at intervals riding forward

Then the sun isn’t up
at intervals while riding forward

but the sun isn’t up
with internally regulated climate
