('isn\xe2\x80\x99t', 'live')

The sun isn’t up 
I upend live connections to you

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
Which is a measure to never live out

Then the sun isn’t available
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Then the sun isn’t up
Which is a pleasure to never live out
