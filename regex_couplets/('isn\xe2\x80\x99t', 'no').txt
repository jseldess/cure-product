The sun isn’t up 
into the minority proportion of time

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
asynchronous 

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
on a snow day with my children

The edge isn’t even there
not rotating

Then the sun isn’t available
I am told by no ventillation

Then the sun isn’t up 
Which can be pronounced to the world

but the sun isn’t up
Then I cannot see face value

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
upsent in the afternoon
