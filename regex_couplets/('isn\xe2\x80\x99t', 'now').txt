The sun isn’t up 
On a snow day with my children

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
who knows the way

The edge isn’t even there
Though how can you know without direction

Then the sun isn’t available
Right now I’m the cart

Then the sun isn’t up 
out in the snow

but the sun isn’t up
out in the snow fall
