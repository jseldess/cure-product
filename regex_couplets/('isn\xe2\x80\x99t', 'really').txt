('isn\xe2\x80\x99t', 'really')

The sun isn’t up 
because it was really dark

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
it was really sunny

The edge isn’t even there
When they really take hold of my finger

Then the sun isn’t available
That’s when they really take

Then the sun isn’t up
without really agreeing
