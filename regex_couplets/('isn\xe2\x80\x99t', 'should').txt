The sun isn’t up 
You should ask who I am

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
While I should be sleeping

Then the sun isn’t up
Looking back while I should be sleeping

Then the sun isn’t available
While I should sleep not back in the results

but the sun isn’t up
I click my zipcode up where it should be down
