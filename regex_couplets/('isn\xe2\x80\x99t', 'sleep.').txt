The sun isn’t up 
Where I sleep at times

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
That’s where I sleep at times

Then the sun isn’t available
Interrupted sleep or

Then the sun isn’t up
While I should be sleeping

but the sun isn’t up
like flattening sleep
