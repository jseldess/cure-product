The sun isn’t up 
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
That is itself not still

The edge isn’t even there
wrestling to stay still

Then the sun isn’t available
I love my daughter still
