The sun isn’t up 
Then I constellate my time family country

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
So I constellate the time family country

Then the sun isn’t available
I constellate the time

Then the sun isn’t up
The CEO tells me to embody values

but the sun isn’t up
I had to tell them the news
