The sun isn’t up 
Where I sleep at times

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
only fragments of time with my children

The edge isn’t even there
at any time it can drift again

Then the sun isn’t available
over the time line I was on

Then the sun isn’t up 
So I constellate the time family country

but the sun isn’t up
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
