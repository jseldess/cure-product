The sun isn’t up 
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
too sunny to eat ice cream

The edge isn’t even there
emerging this year from too much standing water

Then the sun isn’t available
learned without too much difficulty to code

Then the sun isn’t up
Selma knows too
