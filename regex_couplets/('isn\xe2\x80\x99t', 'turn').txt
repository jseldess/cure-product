The sun isn’t up 
in a sharp downward turn 

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
In a sharp downard turn

The edge isn’t even there
sudden downward turn

Then the sun isn’t available
I keep turning back again myself

Then the sun isn’t up
I keep turning back

but the sun isn’t up
who knows how to turn it off
