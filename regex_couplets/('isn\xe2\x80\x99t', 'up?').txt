The sun isn’t up 
Arrayed out in such a nested way

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

The edge isn’t even there
And put in place as though stationary

Then the sun isn’t available
to be before the sun

Then the sun isn’t up 
Did he carry one virtue to excess

but the sun isn’t up
barely outlines

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
I just got a letter
