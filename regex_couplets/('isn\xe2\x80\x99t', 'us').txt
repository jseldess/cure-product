The sun isn’t up 
I suspend live connections to you

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
asynchronous 

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

The edge isn’t even there
russling to stay still

Then the sun isn’t available
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Then the sun isn’t up
was not just a defeat

but the sun isn’t up
I just got a letter
