('joined', 'up?')

I was enjoined to act again myself
The South Carolina primary 

I was enjoined to act again
before the sun’s deflections

I was enjoined to act
I argued the days were longer

I am enjoined to act again
And as an extension of the values

I was enjoined to act against
with full potential to movement

joined in my television
Selma’s squirrel and chickadee

joined me in wasting my vision
my daughter’s squirrel and chickadee joined me
