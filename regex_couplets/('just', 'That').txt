('just', 'That')

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
That’s exaclty what I want for them

They’re just not mine
That is itself not still

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
That’s where I sleep at times

was not just a defeat
That’s when they really take

I just got a letter
That you can see only the back of

it was not just a defeat
That I captured an afterimage
