('just', 'code')

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
as long as I have access to the code

Theyâ€™re just not mine
May I have your zip code

I just got a letter
falling off the encoded end

it was not just a defeat
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

was not just a defeat
zipcode
