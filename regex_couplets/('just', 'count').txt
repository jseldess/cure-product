('just', 'count')

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
Then I constellate my time family country

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
So I constellate the time family country

was not just a defeat
I brought my count down

I just got a letter
without the long time I was accounting

it was not just a defeat
around my country
