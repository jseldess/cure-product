('just', 'do')

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
does not feel an exception

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
in a sharp downward turn 

was not just a defeat
I brought my head down

I just got a letter
What I do in my liesure

it was not just a defeat
So I work and donâ€™t look any
