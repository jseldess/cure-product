('just', 'inter')

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
interjecting on a day ambition

Theyâ€™re just not mine
way high up in the inter

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
hold at intervals riding forward

I just got a letter
with internally regulated climate

it was not just a defeat
Then I saw them interview

was not just a defeat
my interfaced stand data
