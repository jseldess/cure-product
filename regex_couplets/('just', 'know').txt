('just', 'know')

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
how can I know without direction

Theyâ€™re just not mine
for how can you know without direction

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I even know what I would find

it was not just a defeat
even when close to my knowing

was not just a defeat
knowing the constituents
