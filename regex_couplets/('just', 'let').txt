('just', 'let')

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
But I can’t let myself treat 

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I let myself treat

was not just a defeat
It’s the third letter from the end

I just got a letter
The third letter from the end is mine

it was not just a defeat
I let it remind me again
