('just', 'now')

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
on a snow day with my children

They’re just not mine
how can I know without direction

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
Right now I’m the cart

was not just a defeat
out in the snow

I just got a letter
out in the snow fall

it was not just a defeat
even when close to my knowing
