('just', 'ring')

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
interferring 

Theyâ€™re just not mine
bring your child along

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
ring

was not just a defeat
hovering above standing water

I just got a letter
actually considering the end

it was not just a defeat
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
