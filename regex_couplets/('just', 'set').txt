('just', 'set')

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
upset by Gingrich

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
in front of the set afternoon

it was not just a defeat
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

was not just a defeat
Um, upset by Gingrich
