('just', 'so')

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
When I want something

Theyâ€™re just not mine

soft paper

was not just a defeat
A person from a distance

I just got a letter
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

it was not just a defeat
Toward the start informally given my reasons
