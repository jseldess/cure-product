('just', 'time.')

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
only fragments of time with my children

Theyâ€™re just not mine
where I sleep at times

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
at any time it can drift again

was not just a defeat
 and time in the train

I just got a letter
The long time I had a vision

it was not just a defeat
The long time I was a vision
