('just', 'us')

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
Theyâ€™re just not mine

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I want to cite a poem so usual

was not just a defeat
In a vertiginous dream

I just got a letter
So stay with us

it was not just a defeat
I have them trust in me
