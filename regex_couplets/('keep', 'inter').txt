('keep', 'inter')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

It keeps coming down thankfully
interjecting on a day ambition

I keep turning back again myself
hold at intervals riding forward

I keep turning back
at intervals while riding forward
