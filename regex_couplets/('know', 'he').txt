('know', 'he')

who knows the way
battery dawn nights blending themselves

how can I know without direction
The edge is put in place

Though how can you know without direction
I step over the edge

for how can you know without direction
If I step over the edge

I even know what I would find
will not be the same

even when close to my knowing
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

When closed to my knowing
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

knowing the constituents
the opinions in my world

who knows how to turn it off
Though we are waiting for her

who know the ways to their other end
But my not feeling the memory inside

who know the way to their other end
The many transparent pixels call

that their knowing
The weight kept moaned impression
