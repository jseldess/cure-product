('know', 'know.')

who knows the way
how can I know without direction

for how can I know without direction
Though how can you know without direction

for how can you know without direction
I even know what I would find

even when close to my knowing
When closed to my knowing

knowing the constituents
who knows how to turn it off

Selma knows too 
who know the ways to their other end

who know the way to their other end
that their knowing
