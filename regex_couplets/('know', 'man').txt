('know', 'man')

who knows the way
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

I even know what I would find
not many face up

even when close to my knowing
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

knowing the constituents
and that man comes on to tell me 

who knows how to turn it off
The many transparent pixel calls

who know the way to their other end
The many transparent pixels call

that their knowing
