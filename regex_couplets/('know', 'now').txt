('know', 'now')

who knows the way
on a snow day with my children

how can I know without direction
for how can I know without direction

Though how can you know without direction
for how can you know without direction

I even know what I would find
I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking

even when close to my knowing
When closed to my knowing

knowing the constituents
who knows how to turn it off

Selma knows too 
who know the ways to their other end

who know the way to their other end
that their knowing
