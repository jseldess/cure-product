('know', 'ring')

who knows the way
interferring 

how can I know without direction
bring your child along

I even know what I would find
actually considering the end

even when close to my knowing
storing in surfeit

knowing the constituents
firing and connecting somewhere

that their knowing
The prospect for veering healthily
