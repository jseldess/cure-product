('know', 'up?')

who knows the way
In a sharp downard turn

how can I know without direction
for how can I know without direction

Though how can you know without direction
though there are quarters with goals

for how can you know without direction
slow asynchronous

I even know what I would find
White spots on a black surface

even when close to my knowing
If I take some different measure

When closed to my knowing
of my purpose in conversing

knowing the constituents
and found redundant

who knows how to turn it off
Though we are waiting for her

who know the ways to their other end
But my not feeling the memory inside

who know the way to their other end
I end up in Bach

that their knowing
sung reflexing
