('know.', 'eat')

who knows the way
I reach repeated expressions first

how can I know without direction
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

I even know what I would find
it was not just a defeat

even when close to my knowing
And from that great distance

knowing the constituents
for the creation of the universe

that their knowing
