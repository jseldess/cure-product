('last', 'up?')

What was the last time
I reuse indelible tracks

under the last seen principle
I resume attributable visions

Under the last principle 
having been purchased out of you

Under the last principle of purchasing power
she lay under the grass

Where in me did I last
in the form filled offered in trust

last night
all parties would be held

with the latency last night
would only willingly speak

with a latency last night
constituents
