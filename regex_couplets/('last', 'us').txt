('last', 'us')

What was the last time
I reuse indelible tracks

under the last seen principle
a futile joyous white sun

Under the last principle 
Articles all around us

Under the last principle of purchasing power
I wear suspenders

Where in me did I last
in the form filled offered in trust

last night
useless for not having paid
