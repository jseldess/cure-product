('learn', 'Thou')

in light of learning what we see
Though there are quarters goals

I spend time online learning to code
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

decisioned to learn 
Though we are waiting for her

decisioned to learn back
Though we can’t help waiting

phase decision for learning
