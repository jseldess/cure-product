('learn', 'earn')

in light of learning what we see
When we had jobs that were to earn

I spend time online learning to code
learned without too much difficulty to code

Then I am learning to code
I am learning to code

decisioned to learn 
decisioned to learn back

phase decision for learning
for learning by the prospect

a precision for learning
my daughter will learn 

I learned my location
I learned my point

I learned the point where I am
I learned the point of standing

I learned my approval
I learned my approximate point
