('learn', 'he')

in light of learning what we see
Before anyone buys up the opening

I spend time online learning to code
Spinning around the heart

learned without too much difficulty to code
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

Then I am learning to code
So I am told by the ventillation

I am learning to code
The ventillation rushes on

decisioned to learn 
speak them of my possessions

decisioned to learn back
stopping into the prospect

phase decision for learning
for learning by the prospect

a precision for learning
step by into the prospect

my daughter will learn 
buy in the surrounded privacy

I learned my location
the right of surcharge

I learned my point
I learned the point where I am

I learned the point of standing
I have them lost
