('learn', 'up?')

in light of learning what we see
conversation with our feelings

I spend time online learning to code
Spinning around the heart

learned without too much difficulty to code
Having transitioned from leisure to work

Then I am learning to code
The ventillation rushes on

decisioned to learn 
in the form filled offered in trust

decisioned to learn back
by in the sound privacy

phase decision for learning
my daughter will learn 

for learning by the prospect
buy in the surrounded privacy

I learned my location
sung reflexing

I learned my point
requesting my standing

a precision for learning
by in the sounded privacy
