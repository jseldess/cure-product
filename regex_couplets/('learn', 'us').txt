('learn', 'us')

in light of learning what we see
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

I spend time online learning to code
You use the most essential parts

learned without too much difficulty to code
The ventillation rushes on

decisioned to learn 
in the form filled offered in trust

decisioned to learn back
radiating from housing

I learned my location
I have them trust in me

I learned my point
