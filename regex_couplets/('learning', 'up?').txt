('learning', 'up?')

in light of learning what we see
conversation with our feelings

I spend time online learning to code
Spinning around the heart

Then I am learning to code
The ventillation rushes on

phase decision for learning
my daughter will learn 

for learning by the prospect
buy in the surrounded privacy

a precision for learning
by in the sounded privacy
