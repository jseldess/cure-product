('least', 'up?')

or argued for them at least
I am full of potential

where I am aside at least
for the duration of the answer

where I am decided least
But my not feeling the memory aside

at least most days
the least productive of myself

the least instructive of myself
at least instructive of myself

at least for the duration of the answer
for the creation of the universe
