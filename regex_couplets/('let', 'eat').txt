('let', 'eat')

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to treat others

I let myself treat
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

If I let myself see others desires
executive breath

It’s the third letter from the end
of the habits I create

I let it remind me again
And from that great distance
