('let', 'he')

But I can’t let myself treat 
others desires

If I let myself see others desires
where I sleep at times

I let myself treat
In the right sense

But I can’t let myself disregard
Others desires as legitimate

It’s the third letter from the end
The third letter from the end is mine

I just got a letter
I see only the back of falling values

I let it remind me again
Where I lead gravity
