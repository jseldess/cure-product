('let', 'here')

But I can’t let myself treat 
where I sleep at times

If I let myself see others desires
I’ll get there eventually

I let myself treat
here described

But I can’t let myself disregard
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

It’s the third letter from the end
there was no promotion

I let it remind me again
Where I lead gravity
