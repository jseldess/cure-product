('let', 'so')

But I can’t let myself treat 
reasons resources

I let myself treat
soft paper

If I let myself see others desires
I’ll pull myself another personality type

It’s the third letter from the end
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I let it remind me again
or in some imaginary elsewhere
