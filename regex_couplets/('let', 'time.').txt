('let', 'time.')

But I can’t let myself treat 
where I sleep at times

If I let myself see others desires
at any time it can drift again

I let myself treat
Then I constellate my time family country

But I can’t let myself disregard
over the long time up in the sky

It’s the third letter from the end
The long time I had a vision

I let it remind me again
or alter of course the time anyway
