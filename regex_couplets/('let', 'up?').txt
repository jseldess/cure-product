('let', 'up?')

But I can’t let myself treat 
as a pure product

If I let myself see others desires
as an impure product

I let myself treat
and is relentlessly budgeted

But I can’t let myself disregard
Then I cannot see face value

It’s the third letter from the end
I just got a letter

The third letter from the end is mine
I see only the back of falling values

I let it remind me again
while consuming damage
