('light', 'It')

variegated reflected light
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
It keeps coming down thankfully

In the light of retroactive conversations
It has been since

stopped light with validated fields
It’s not marshal exactly

where lights blended themselves
