('light', 'any')

variegated reflected light
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

In the light of retroactive
Before anyone buys up the opening

stopped light with validated fields
The many transparent pixel calls

where lights blended themselves
or imagined anyway
