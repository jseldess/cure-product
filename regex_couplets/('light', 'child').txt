('light', 'child')

variegated reflected light
On a snow day with my children

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
about my childrenâ€™s consumption

In the retroactive light
especially in a child

stopped light with validated fields
my possession of my children

where lights blended themselves
speech my possession of my children

stopped light with validated faces
