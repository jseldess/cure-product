('light', 'going')

variegated reflected light
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

stopped light with validated fields
The way that I am going

where lights blended themselves
