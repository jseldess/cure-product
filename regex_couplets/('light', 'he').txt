('light', 'he')

variegated reflected light
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
who knows the way

stopped light with validated variegated fields
battery dawn nights blending themselves

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
Then fall then summer from my face

In the retroactive light
Face falling off the edge of the face

In the light of retroactive conversations
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

In the light of retroactive
Then fall then summer

in light of learning what we see
Before anyone buys up the opening

stopped light with validated fields
By my memory elsewhere

where lights blended themselves
where rights ended themselves

stopped light with validated faces
But my not feeling the memory inside
