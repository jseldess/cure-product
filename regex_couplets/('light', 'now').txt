variegated reflected light
On a snow day with my children

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
who knows the way

stopped light with validated variegated fields
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

stopped light with validated fields
who knows how to turn it off

where lights blended themselves
that their knowing
