('light', 'our')

variegated reflected light
reasons resources

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
conversations with our purchase

In the light of retroactive
conversations with our reactions

in light of learning what we see
conversation with our feelings

stopped light with validated fields
Who throws contours away

where lights blended themselves
phrase them of our possessions
