('light', 'too.')

variegated reflected light
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
emerging this year from too much standing water

stopped light with validated fields
Selma knows too 

where lights blended themselves
