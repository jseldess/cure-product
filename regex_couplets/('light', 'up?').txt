('light', 'up?')

variegated reflected light
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
In a sharp downard turn

In the retroactive light
value falling off the edge of the face

In the light of retroactive conversations
conversations with our purchase

In the light of retroactive
conversations with our reactions

in light of learning what we see
conversation with our feelings

stopped light with validated fields
I answered about

where lights blended themselves
I assumed what I draw

stopped light with validated faces
which I feel formerly about for
