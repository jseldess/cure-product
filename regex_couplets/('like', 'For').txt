('like', 'For')

I would like your zip code
Forecasting the story before dawn

like flattening sleep 
For an ungraspable time

A way formerly like this one
For my own purchases

like a shirt
Formerly a way like this one

The other end of transactions like this
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

To the other end of transactions like this
Forty-one seconds in
