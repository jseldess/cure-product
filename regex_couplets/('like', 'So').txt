('like', 'so')

I would like your zip code
A person from a distance

like flattening sleep 
If I take some different measure

like state mirror
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

A way formerly like this one
sound inundated for my own purchases

like a shirt
so still watch them

Formerly a way like this one
by in the sound privacy
