('like', 'To')

I would like your zip code
To that impossible place

like flattening sleep 
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

A way formerly like this one
To the ends of transactions

Formerly a way like this one
To the ends of my transactions

The other end of transactions like this
To the other end of transactions

To the other end of transactions like this
To the other end of means like this one

like this one
To the right of determined elections
