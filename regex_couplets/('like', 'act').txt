('like', 'act')

I would like your zip code
I was enjoined to act again

like flattening sleep 
we had inhabited actually

A way formerly like this one
The ends of my transactions

like a shirt
To the ends of transactions

Formerly a way like this one
Itâ€™s not marshal exactly

The other end of transactions like this
to the ends of my transactions

To the other end of transactions like this
of my actions

To the other end of means like this one
the other end transactions
