('like', 'constant')

I would like your zip code
with constant ways 

Formerly a way like this one
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

The other end of transactions like this
with no constant way

To the other end of transactions like this
There are constant ways

To the other end of means like this one
with constant ways to the other end
