('like', 'form')

I would like your zip code
Toward the start informally given my reasons

like flattening sleep 
already formerly a long time

A way formerly like this one
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

like a shirt
in the form filled offered trust

Formerly a way like this one
formerly a way

The other end of transactions like this
formerly away
