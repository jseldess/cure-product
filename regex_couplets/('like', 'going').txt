('like', 'going')

I would like your zip code
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

like flattening sleep 
The way that she is going

A way formerly like this one
The way that I am going

Formerly a way like this one
The way that I was going

The other end of transactions like this
way I was going
