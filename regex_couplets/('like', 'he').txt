('like', 'he')

I would like your zip code
Then I cannot see face value

like flattening sleep 
talking into percents bending themselves

like state mirror
without the long time I was accounting

like un
I enter the flattening mirror

like sleep
talking into the cents

I like sleep
in the sense of watching

which is like sleep
I get through there

A way formerly like this one
The constituents would be helped

like a shirt
pre-worn and still wash them

Formerly a way like this one
to the other end

The other end of transactions like this
who knows the way

To the other end of transactions like this
By my feeling the memory inside

To the other end of means like this one
Like this one the other end of means

like this one
the other end transactions
