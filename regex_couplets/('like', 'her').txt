('like', 'her')

I would like your zip code
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

like flattening sleep 
I get through there

A way formerly like this one
where I send and relive would be held

like a shirt
Where in me pre-worn

Formerly a way like this one
to the other end

The other end of transactions like this
to their other end

To the other end of transactions like this
There are constant ways

To the other end of means like this one
Like this one the other end of means

like this one
the other end transactions
