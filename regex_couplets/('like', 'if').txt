('like', 'if')

I would like your zip code
out of the fifth page ruins

like flattening sleep 
If I take a different measure

like state mirror
If I take some different measure

like un
if there is anything 

A way formerly like this one
if that has anything

like a shirt
if only on the way to the trash
