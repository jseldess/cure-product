('like', 'know')

I would like your zip code
I even know what I would find

like flattening sleep 
even when close to my knowing

A way formerly like this one
knowing the constituents

like a shirt
who knows the way

Formerly a way like this one
who knows how to turn it off

The other end of transactions like this
who know the ways to their other end

To the other end of transactions like this
that their knowing
