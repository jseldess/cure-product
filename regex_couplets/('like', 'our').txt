('like', 'our')

I would like your zip code
or an available resource

like flattening sleep 
or alter of course the time anyway

A way formerly like this one
Who throws contours away

Formerly a way like this one
who throws contours a way

The other end of transactions like this
The contours exchange with you

To the other end of transactions like this
phrase them of our possessions
