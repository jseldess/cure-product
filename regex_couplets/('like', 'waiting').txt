('like', 'waiting')

I would like your zip code
There are spots waiting

A way formerly like this one
Though we are waiting 

like a shirt
though we are waiting for her

Formerly a way like this one
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

The other end of transactions like this
waiting out front or up above
