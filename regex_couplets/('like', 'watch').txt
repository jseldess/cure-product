('like', 'watch')

I would like your zip code
when watching tv

like flattening sleep 
in the sense of watching

which is like sleep
I watch a movie

I like sleep
always watching

A way formerly like this one
When I'm watching my tv 

like a shirt
so still watch them

Formerly a way like this one
where Iâ€™m watching my tv
