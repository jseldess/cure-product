('like', 'ways')

I would like your zip code
always watching

A way formerly like this one
deep into pathways from repeated travels

like a shirt
with constant ways 

Formerly a way like this one
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

The other end of transactions like this
with no constant ways 

To the other end of transactions like this
There are constant ways

To the other end of means like this one
with constant ways to the other end
