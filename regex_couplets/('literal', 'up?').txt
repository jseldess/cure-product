('literal', 'up?')

and literally moved
without really agreeing

as it was designed literally
where I send and relive would be held

and literally unproved
I stand and retrieve the impulse

literally unproved 
they should rise up

myself moved literally as it is
and literally moved about

when it is not literal
in the form filled offered in trust

I literally moved
it can be uncomfortable 

and move them literally with me
without their agreement

literally move
without really needing

and it’s not literal
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

literally moved
redundant

what literally moved
about the site

not literally moved about
washed I answered about

not literally moved
which I feel formerly about for
