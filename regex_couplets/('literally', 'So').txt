('literally', 'so')

and literally moved
I want to cite a poem so usual

as it was designed literally
sound inundated for my own purchases

and literally unproved
and sound redundant

literally unproved 
firing and connecting somewhere

myself moved literally as it is
so still watch them

not literally moved about
so still them

not literally moved
buy in the sound privacy
