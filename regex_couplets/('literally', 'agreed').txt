('literally', 'agreed')

and literally moved
and to which I’ve agreed

as it was designed literally
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

and literally unproved
and for which the plan agreed

I literally moved
that agreed one of rest

and literally moved about
and to which the plan agreed

literally moved
that agreed home
