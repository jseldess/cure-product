('literally', 'feel')

and literally moved
But my not feeling the memory aside

as it was designed literally
But my not feeling the memory inside

and literally unproved
which feels most comfortable

I literally moved
which feels more comfortable

and literally moved about
which is what feels most comfortable

not literally moved about
By my feeling the memory inside

not literally moved
which I feel formerly about for
