('literally', 'form')

and literally moved
A way formerly like this one

as it was designed literally
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

and literally unproved
already formely a long time

literally unproved 
already formerly a long time

myself moved literally as it is
in the form filled offered in trust

I literally moved
with dawn already formerly nights 

and literally moved about
in the form filled offered trust

not literally moved about
in the form filled offered must

not literally moved
which I feel formerly about for
