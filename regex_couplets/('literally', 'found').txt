('literally', 'found')

and literally moved
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

as it was designed literally
found dated for my own purchases

and literally unproved
and found inundated

literally unproved 
and found redundant

myself moved literally as it is
So I found myself at home
