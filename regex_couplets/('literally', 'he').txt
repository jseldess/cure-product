('literally', 'he')

and literally moved
if there is anything 

as it was designed literally
where I send and relive would be held

and literally unproved
I stand and retrieve the impulse

literally unproved 
they should rise up

myself moved literally as it is
and for which the plan agreed

I literally moved
when I move

and move them literally with me
I literally move them

literally move
The floor slanted in places

and literally moved about
and to which the plan agreed

literally moved
in the space that it had

what literally moved
in the face that it had

not literally moved about
washed I answered about

not literally moved
I stay the right of my elections
