('literally', 'literal')

and literally moved
as it was designed literally

and literally unproved
literally unproved 

myself moved literally as it is
and literally moved about

I literally moved
and itâ€™s not literal

and move them literally with me
I literally move them

literally move
literally moved

what literally moved
not literally moved about

not literally moved
