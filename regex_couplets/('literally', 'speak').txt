('literally', 'speak')

and literally moved
not speaking

as it was designed literally
without really speaking

and literally unproved
I speak to them

myself moved literally as it is
I speak to them my possessions

and move them literally with me
I speak them of my possessions

and literally moved about
speak them of my possessions

not literally moved about
