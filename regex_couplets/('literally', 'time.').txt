('literally', 'time.')

and literally moved
Or alter of course the time anyway

as it was designed literally
until a happier time found

myself moved literally as it is
formerly a long time they were on

and literally moved about
formerly along time they were on

not literally moved about
in the long time they were on

not literally moved
