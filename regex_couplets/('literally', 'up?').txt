('literally', 'up?')

and literally moved
without really agreeing

as it was designed literally
where I send and relive would be held

and literally unproved
I stand and retrieve the impulse

literally unproved 
they should rise up

myself moved literally as it is
and literally moved about

I literally moved
it can be uncomfortable 

and move them literally with me
without their agreement

literally move
without really needing

literally moved
in the form filled offered in trust

what literally moved
redundant

not literally moved about
washed I answered about

not literally moved
which I feel formerly about for
