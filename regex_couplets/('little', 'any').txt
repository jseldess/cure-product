('little', 'any')

with little reason to move
The days aligned for company

with little reasons to aspiration
The days aligned long company

aspirating with little visions
That company creates a life

I aspirate with little vision
there wasnâ€™t any television 

I swayed a little in my state
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
