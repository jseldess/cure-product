('little', 'day')

with little reason to move
The days were long

There was very little physical activity
I argued that the days were longer

with little reasons to aspiration
The days long aligned

with little reasons to move
The days were long aligned

aspirating with little visions
embodied everyday

embodied with little reason
The days are long

I aspirate with little vision
The day

I swayed a little in my state
