('little', 'he')

with little reason to move
across the retinas

There was very little physical activity
aside from the retinas

with little reasons to aspiration
And as an extension of the values

embodied with little visions
off the end myself

with little reasons to move
The days were long aligned

aspirating with little visions
As an extension of the values

embodied with little reason
that potential is there for you

I aspirate with little vision
The days are long

I swayed a little in my state
in the long time they were on
