('little', 'move')

with little reason to move
with little reasons to move

embodied with little reason
Since I can imagine movement

There was very little physical activity
with full potential to movement

aspirating with little visions
since you can imagine movement

I swayed a little in my state
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
