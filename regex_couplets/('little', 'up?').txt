('little', 'up?')

with little reason to move
I argued that the days were longer

with little reasons to aspiration
And as an extension of the values

embodied with little visions
with full potential to movement

There was very little physical activity
or argued for them at least

with little reasons to move
full of aspirations

embodied with little aspirations
full of potential

aspirating with little visions
As an extension of the values

embodied with little reason
that potential is there for you

I aspirate with little vision
I am full of potential

I swayed a little in my state
in traversing my circuit
