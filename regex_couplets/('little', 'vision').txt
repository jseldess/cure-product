('little', 'vision')

with little reason to move
aspirating with visions

with little reasons to aspiration
embodied with little visions

There was very little physical activity
little visions

aspirating with little visions
I aspirate with little vision

with little reason to aspiration
I had me a vision

embodied with little reason
I reuse unassimilable visions

I swayed a little in my state
I resume attributable visions
