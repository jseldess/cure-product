('live', 'As')

I am to end my connections suspended live
Ask who I am to suspend

I suspend live connections to you
Ask who I am

I intend my live connections to you
Ask who I am to end my live connection

Suspended live in connections to you
As though stationary and a destination

Which is a measure to never live out
Assimilable or

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
As a clone, illegally conceived

Which is a pleasure to never live out
