('live', 'For')

I am to end my connections suspended live
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Which is a measure to never live out
Forecasting the story before dawn

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
For an ungraspable time

Which is a pleasure to never live out
For Mitt Romney

where I send and relive aside
For my own purchases

where I stand and relive
Formerly a way like this one

where I send and relive
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
