('live', 'Having')

I am to end my connections suspended live
Having transitioned from leisure to work

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
Having been purchased out of you

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Having seen more than 

where I send and relive
Having seen more than I can remember
