('live', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

I am to end my connections suspended live
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Which is a measure to never live out
Right now I’m the cart

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

Which is a pleasure to never live out
where I’m watching my tv
