('live', 'It')

I am to end my connections suspended live
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

Which is a measure to never live out
It has been since

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

Which is a pleasure to never live out
It’s not marshal exactly

where I send and relive
