('live', 'My')

I am to end my connections suspended live
My live connections to you

Ask who I am to end my live connection
My associations

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
My purpose up in the sky

Which is a pleasure to never live out
My daughter with her way

where I send and relive
My say to the elections
