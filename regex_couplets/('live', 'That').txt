('live', 'That')

I am to end my connections suspended live
That’s exaclty what I want for them

Which is a measure to never live out
That’s where I sleep at times

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
That’s when they really take

Which is a pleasure to never live out
That I captured an afterimage

where I send and relive aside
That are my right to say
