('live', 'Thou')

I am to end my connections suspended live
Though there are quarters goals

Which is a measure to never live out
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
Though we are waiting for her

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Though we are breaking 

where I send and relive aside
Though we are waiting 

where I send and relive
