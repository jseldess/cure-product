('live', 'To')

I am to end my connections suspended live
To my children Walt Whitman

Which is a measure to never live out
To my chidren

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

Which is a pleasure to never live out
To neither study

where I send and relive aside
To the ends of transactions

where I send and relive
To the right of determined elections
