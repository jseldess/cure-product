('live', 'We')

I am to end my connections suspended live
We’ll have coffee this morning

I suspend live connections to you
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Which is a measure to never live out
We had to say goodbye there

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
We got paid one way by a voice

where I send and relive aside
We ask say in that case
