('live', 'across')

I am to end my connections suspended live
Before we walk across the wide field

Which is a measure to never live out
across the retinas

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

Which is a pleasure to never live out
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
