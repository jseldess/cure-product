('live', 'bill')

I am to end my connections suspended live
between bills and stuffed animals

Which is a measure to never live out
I hear it between bills and stuff

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
billowing in the cloud

Which is a pleasure to never live out
the bill my detuning
