('live', 'but')

I am to end my connections suspended live
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

Which is a measure to never live out
Attributable or

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I resume attributable visions

Which is a pleasure to never live out
but where is it

where I send and relive aside
that decisions can be attributable

where I send and relive
but for memory elsewhere
