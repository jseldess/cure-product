('live', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

I am to end my connections suspended live
I can’t fix them without direction

Which is a measure to never live out
and can’t presume to need

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
That can’t be glimpsed

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Though we can’t help waiting

where I send and relive
I can’t remember them
