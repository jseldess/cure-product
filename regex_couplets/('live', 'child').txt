('live', 'child')

I am to end my connections suspended live
On a snow day with my children

Which is a measure to never live out
To my children Walt Whitman

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
even my child

Which is a pleasure to never live out
my possession of my children

where I send and relive
speech my possession of my children
