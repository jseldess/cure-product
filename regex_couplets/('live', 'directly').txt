('live', 'directly')

I am to end my connections suspended live
if not directly on my skin

Which is a measure to never live out
But not to me directly

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
The sun high enough to enter directly 

Which is a pleasure to never live out
The sun high enough to strike directly
