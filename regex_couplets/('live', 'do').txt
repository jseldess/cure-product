('live', 'do')

I am to end my connections suspended live
The dogs and lillies

I upend live connections to you
in a sharp downward turn 

Which is a measure to never live out
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I brought my head down

Which is a pleasure to never live out
I walk up and don’t work anymore

where I send and relive aside
and it doesn’t take long

where I send and retrieve relive
latency which doesn’t mean anything

where I send and relive
I only think I don’t listen
