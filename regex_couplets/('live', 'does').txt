('live', 'does')

I am to end my connections suspended live
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

Which is a measure to never live out
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
and it doesn’t take long

where I send and retrieve relive
latency which doesn’t mean anything

where I send and relive
