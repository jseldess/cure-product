('live', 'eat')

I am to end my connections suspended live
too sunny to eat ice cream

Which is a measure to never live out
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Which is a pleasure to never live out
was not just a defeat

where I send and relive aside
for the creation of the universe

where I send and retrieve relive
burrowed about from repeated travels

where I send and relive
from cables reheated travels

where I stand and retrieve and relive
