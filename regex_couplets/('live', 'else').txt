('live', 'else')

I am to end my connections suspended live
If you have confidence regardless all else

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

Which is a pleasure to never live out
and elsewhere my memory

where I send and relive aside
elsewhere my purposes

where I send and relive would be held
elsewhere by my memory

where I send and relive
By my memory elsewhere

where I stand and relive
in memory elsewhere
