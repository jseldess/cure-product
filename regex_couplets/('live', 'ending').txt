('live', 'ending')

I am to end my connections suspended live
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Which is a measure to never live out
I tried to feel the key values extending 

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
talking into pheasants bending themselves

Which is a pleasure to never live out
talking into percents bending themselves

where I send and relive aside
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

where I send and retrieve relive
battery dawn nights ending themselves
