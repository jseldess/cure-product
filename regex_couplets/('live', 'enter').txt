('live', 'enter')

I am to end my connections suspended live
I have entered my phone

Which is a measure to never live out
The sun high enough to enter directly 

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I have entered my purposes

where I send and relive aside
I have entered my purchases

where I send and relive would be held
I had entered my phone
