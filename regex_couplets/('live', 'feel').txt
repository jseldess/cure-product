('live', 'feel')

I am to end my connections suspended live
conversations with our feelings

Which is a measure to never live out
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I tried to feel the key values extending 

Which is a pleasure to never live out
But my not feeling the memory aside

where I send and relive aside
But my not feeling the memory inside

where I send and relive
which feels most comfortable

where I stand and relive
But my feeling the memory aside
