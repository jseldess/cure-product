('live', 'front')

I am to end my connections suspended live
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Which is a measure to never live out
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
And need out in front purchase

Which is a pleasure to never live out
behind or out front or up above
