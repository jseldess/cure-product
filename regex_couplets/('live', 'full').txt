('live', 'full')

I am to end my connections suspended live
It keeps coming down thankfully

Which is a measure to never live out
I am full of potential

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
full of the missing words

Which is a pleasure to never live out
still carefully

where I send and relive
