('live', 'going')

I am to end my connections suspended live
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Which is a measure to never live out
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
The way that she is going

where I send and relive would be held
The way that I am going

where I send and relive
