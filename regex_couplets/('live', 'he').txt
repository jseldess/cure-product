('live', 'he')

I am to end my connections suspended live
But that is beside the point

I suspend live connections to you
Where I sleep at times

I upend live connections to you
Whereas direction is beside the point

I intend my live connections to you
The dogs and lillies

Which is a measure to never live out
others desires

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
You can hear it also through your leisure

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

where I send and relive aside
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

where I stand and relive
the impulse for my own prospects

where I stand and retrieve relive
Where I host my purposes

where I send and relive would be held
All parties would be held for my own purchases

where I send and relive
But my not feeling the memory inside

where I send and retrieve relive
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

and relive from burrowed travels
from cables reheated travels

where I stand and retrieve and relive
where I am aside

where I end and relive
the duration of answers

where I blend and relive
The ends of my transactions
