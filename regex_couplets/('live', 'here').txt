('live', 'here')

I am to end my connections suspended live
Where I sleep at times

I suspend live connections to you
Whereas direction is beside the point

I upend live connections to you
The prospects there already

Which is a measure to never live out
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
here described

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Where official policy is to catch and release

where I send and relive aside
where I stand and relive

where I stand and retrieve relive
Where I host my purposes

where I send and relive would be held
Where in me did I last

where I send and relive
where I end

where I send and retrieve relive
where I stand and retrieve and relive

where I end and relive
where I am aside

where I blend and relive
Where in me did I host

and relive from burrowed travels
firing and connecting somewhere
