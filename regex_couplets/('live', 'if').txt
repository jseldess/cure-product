('live', 'if')

I am to end my connections suspended live
drifting away

Which is a measure to never live out
drifting away needs others presume desires

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
if you have providence to excess

Which is a pleasure to never live out
if he had not carried one virtue 

where I send and relive aside
if there is anything 

where I send and relive
if only on the way to the trash
