('live', 'inter')

I am to end my connections suspended live
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Which is a measure to never live out
way high up in the inter

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
hold at intervals riding forward

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Then I saw them interview

where I send and relive aside
my interfaced stand data
