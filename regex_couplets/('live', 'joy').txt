('live', 'joy')

I am to end my connections suspended live
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

Which is a measure to never live out
I was enjoying acting against myself

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
a futile joyous white sun

Which is a pleasure to never live out
