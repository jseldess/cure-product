('live', 'just')

I am to end my connections suspended live
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Which is a measure to never live out
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
was not just a defeat

Which is a pleasure to never live out
it was not just a defeat

where I send and relive aside
