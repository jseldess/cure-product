('live', 'know.')

I am to end my connections suspended live
who knows the way

Which is a measure to never live out
I even know what I would find

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
even when close to my knowing

Which is a pleasure to never live out
knowing the constituents

where I send and relive
that their knowing
