('live', 'man')

I am to end my connections suspended live
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

Which is a measure to never live out
To my children Walt Whitman

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
not many face up

Which is a pleasure to never live out
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

where I send and relive aside
They have very many choices

where I send and relive would be held
and that man comes on to tell me 

where I send and relive
