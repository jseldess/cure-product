('live', 'nor')

I am to end my connections suspended live
into the minority proportion of time

I upend live connections to you
over the long line I would honor

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
nor work in this way daily

Which is a pleasure to never live out
nor envy honest work

where I send and relive aside
which had on honor to be told

where I send and relive
