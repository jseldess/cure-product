('live', 'now')

I am to end my connections suspended live
On a snow day with my children

Which is a measure to never live out
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
out in the snow

Which is a pleasure to never live out
even when close to my knowing

where I send and relive aside
knowing the constituents

where I send and relive
who knows the way

where I stand and relive
that their knowing
