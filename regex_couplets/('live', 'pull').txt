('live', 'pull')

I am to end my connections suspended live
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Which is a measure to never live out
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
fish pulled out of the lake

Which is a pleasure to never live out
