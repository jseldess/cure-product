('live', 'resume')

I am to end my connections suspended live
So I presume the offers already

Which is a measure to never live out
and canâ€™t presume to need

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I resume unassimilable visions

Which is a pleasure to never live out
I resume attributable visions

where I send and relive aside
I presume to others

where I send and relive
I presume the offers
