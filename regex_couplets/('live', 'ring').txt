('live', 'ring')

I am to end my connections suspended live
interferring 

Which is a measure to never live out
bring your child along

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
ring

Which is a pleasure to never live out
hovering above standing water

where I send and relive aside
firing and connecting somewhere

where I blend and relive
The prospect for veering healthily
