('live', 'set')

I am to end my connections suspended live
upset by Gingrich

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
in front of the set afternoon

Which is a pleasure to never live out
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

where I send and relive aside
presets
