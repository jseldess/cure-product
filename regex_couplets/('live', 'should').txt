('live', 'should')

I am to end my connections suspended live
You should ask who I am

I suspend live connections to you
While I should be sleeping

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

Which is a pleasure to never live out
they should rise up

where I send and relive
