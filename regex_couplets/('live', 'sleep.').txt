('live', 'sleep.')

I am to end my connections suspended live
Where I sleep at times

I suspend live connections to you
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Which is a measure to never live out
That’s where I sleep at times

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
Interrupted sleep or

Which is a pleasure to never live out
like flattening sleep 

where I send and relive aside
