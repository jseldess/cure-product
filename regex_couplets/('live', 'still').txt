('live', 'still')

I am to end my connections suspended live
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Which is a measure to never live out
I love my daughter still

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
though we are still breaking in

where I send and relive would be held
still wash conserving

where I send and relive
