('live', 'story')

I am to end my connections suspended live
I told her a story, she drew waves.

Which is a measure to never live out
Forecasting the story before dawn

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
as far back as my history heard

Which is a pleasure to never live out
You need history

where I send and relive aside
