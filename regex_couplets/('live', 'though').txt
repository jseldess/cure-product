('live', 'though')

I am to end my connections suspended live
As though stationary and a destination

Which is a measure to never live out
though it was most emphatically that

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I thought

Which is a pleasure to never live out
though we are still breaking in

where I send and relive would be held
after though thereâ€™s no memory

where I send and relive
I answered what I thought
