('live', 'told')

I am to end my connections suspended live
I told her a story, she drew waves.

Which is a measure to never live out
I am told ventillation

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I am told by no ventillation

Which is a pleasure to never live out
which ran to be told

where I send and relive
