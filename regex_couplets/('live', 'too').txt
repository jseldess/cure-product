('live', 'too')

I am to end my connections suspended live
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

Which is a measure to never live out
emerging this year from too much standing water

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
Selma knows too 

where I send and relive
