('live', 'turn')

I am to end my connections suspended live
in a sharp downward turn 

Which is a measure to never live out
sudden downward turn

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I keep turning back again myself

Which is a pleasure to never live out
who knows how to turn it off

where I send and relive
I turn not sad exactly
