('live', 'visible')

I am to end my connections suspended live
I assumed it was visible

I upend live connections to you
Iâ€™ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

Which is a measure to never live out
And make myself a visible

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
Divisible or

Which is a pleasure to never live out
I assume the offers divisible
