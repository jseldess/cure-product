('live', 'walk')

I am to end my connections suspended live
Before we walk across the wide field

Which is a measure to never live out
there was no walking along the pleasure

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

Which is a pleasure to never live out
