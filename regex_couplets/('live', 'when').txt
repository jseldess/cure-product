('live', 'When')

I am to end my connections suspended live
When I woke up in the morning

Which is a measure to never live out
When we had jobs that were to earn

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
When closed to my knowing

Which is a pleasure to never live out
When I'm watching my tv 

where I send and relive
