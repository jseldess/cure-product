('live', 'will')

I am to end my connections suspended live
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

Which is a measure to never live out
will not be the same

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
that will spur me on

Which is a pleasure to never live out
would only willingly break

where I send and relive
my daughter will learn
