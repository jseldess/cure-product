('live', 'you.')

I am to end my connections suspended live
Though how can you know without direction

Which is a measure to never live out
bring your child along

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
You can hear it also through your leisure

Which is a pleasure to never live out
if you have providence to excess

where I send and relive aside
the young ripples inaudibly
