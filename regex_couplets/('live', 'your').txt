('live', 'your')

I am to end my connections suspended live
You can hear it also through your leisure

Which is a measure to never live out
bring your child along

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
May I have your zip code

Which is a pleasure to never live out
This is your voice 

where I send and relive aside
