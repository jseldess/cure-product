('long', 'A')

as long as I have access to the code
Actually one day there is direction

bring your child along
And as an extension of the values

over the long time up in the sky
And make myself a visible

over the long line up in the sky
After having been contented

over the long line I would honor
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

over the long time I was on
THE PLANNING PROCESS

I argued the days felt longer
Aspirational strategy

The days long aligned
As an extension of the values

The days are long
All that I can think I want

The long time I had a vision
A defeated

The long time I was a vision
COPY DREAM 

without longer damage
As a clone, illegally conceived

already formerly a long time
And we could inhabit the room easy

formerly a long time they were on
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

already formely a long time
All parties would be held

and it doesnâ€™t take long
CONTRACT

formerly along time they were on
A baby and a bear

shone formerly a long time
Aligned or not with my interests

in the long time they were on
