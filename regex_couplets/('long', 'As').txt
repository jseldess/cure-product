('long', 'As')

as long as I have access to the code
As though stationary and a destination

bring your child along
Assimilable or

over the long time up in the sky
Aspirational strategy

I argued the days felt longer
As an extension of the values

The days are long
As a clone, illegally conceived

without longer damage
