('long', 'but')

as long as I have access to the code
but not impart cynicism

bring your child along
Attributable or

over the long time up in the sky
but the sun isnâ€™t up

I argued the days felt longer
but it continued

The days long aligned
but it continued rippling muscle

The days were long aligned
but would I love her the same

The long time I had a vision
but they are black spots

without the long time I was accounting
but I can hear them

The long time I was a vision
I resume attributable visions

which is the long time I was on
attributable visions

without longer damage
that decisions can be attributable

shone formerly a long time
but for memory elsewhere

in the long time they were on
but standing in memory

shone formerly along time
decisions that can be attributable
