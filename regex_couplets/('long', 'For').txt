('long', 'For')

as long as I have access to the code
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

bring your child along
Forecasting the story before dawn

over the long time up in the sky
For an ungraspable time

without longer damage
For Mitt Romney

already formely a long time
For my own purchases

already formerly a long time
Formerly a way like this one

shone formerly a long time
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
