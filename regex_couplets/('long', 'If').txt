('long', 'if')

as long as I have access to the code
drifting does not feel an exception

bring your child along
What does it mean to drift

and bear children along
the drifting is not something special

over the long time up in the sky
drifting away

over the long line up in the sky
if you have providence to excess

over the long line I would honor
learned without too much difficulty to code

I argued the days felt longer
That company creates a life

The days are long
Life is with people

The days were long
If I take a different measure

The long time I had a vision
If I take some different measure

without the long time I was accounting
if there is anything 

already formely a long time
if that has anything

formerly a long time they were on
if only on the way to the trash
