('long', 'IN')

as long as I have access to the code
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

over the long time up in the sky
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

over the long time I was on
THE PLANNING PROCESS

I argued the days felt longer
ASPIRATING VISIONS

The days long aligned
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

without longer damage

already formely a long time
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

already formerly a long time
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

shone formerly a long time
