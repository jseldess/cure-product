('long', 'THE')

as long as I have access to the code
THE SNOW

over the long time up in the sky
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

over the long line up in the sky
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

over the long time I was on
THE PLANNING PROCESS

I argued the days felt longer
THE OFFERS

The long time I had a vision
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

without longer damage
