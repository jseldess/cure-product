as long as I have access to the code
That is itself not still

bring your child along
That’s where I sleep at times

over the long time up in the sky
That’s when they really take

over the long line up in the sky

I argued the days felt longer
That company creates a life

The days are long
That I captured an afterimage

without longer damage
That are my right to say

in the long time they were on
