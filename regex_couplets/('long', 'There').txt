('long', 'There')

as long as I have access to the code
There are quarterly goals

over the long time up in the sky
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

over the long line up in the sky
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
There are spots waiting

without longer damage
There are constant ways

shone formerly a long time
