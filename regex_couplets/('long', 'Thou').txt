('long', 'Thou')

as long as I have access to the code
Though there are quarters goals

bring your child along
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

The long time I had a vision
Though in not many acts

without the long time I was accounting
Though we are waiting for her

already formerly a long time
Though we are breaking 

already formely a long time
Though we are waiting 

formerly a long time they were on
Though we can’t help waiting

shone formerly a long time
