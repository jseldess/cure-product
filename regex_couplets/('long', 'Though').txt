('long', 'though')

as long as I have access to the code
As though stationary and a destination

bring your child along
though it was most emphatically that

over the long time up in the sky
I had nightmares though

The days long aligned
though not many freeze up

The long time I had a vision
though not many facts up in the sky

without the long time I was accounting
though in not many acts up in the sky

The long time I was a vision
I thought

already formerly a long time
though we are still breaking in

already formely a long time
after though thereâ€™s no memory

formerly along time they were on
though we are waiting for her

shone formerly a long time
I answered what I thought

formerly along my say to the elections
I answered what I thought about

in the long time they were on
