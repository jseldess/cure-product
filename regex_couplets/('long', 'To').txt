('long', 'To')

as long as I have access to the code
To my children Walt Whitman

bring your child along
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

over the long time up in the sky
Tomorrow

I argued the days felt longer
Toward the start informally given my reasons

The long time I had a vision
To neither study

already formely a long time
To the ends of transactions

already formerly a long time
To the ends of my transactions

shone formerly a long time
To the right of determined elections

in the long time they were on
