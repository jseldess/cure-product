('long', 'what')

as long as I have access to the code
what I find there

bring your child along
I invited most of what came next

The days long aligned
I even know what I would find

The long time I had a vision
what literally moved

already formerly a long time
I answered what I thought

shone formerly a long time
I assumed what I draw

formerly along time they were on
I answered what I thought about

in the long time they were on
to return what I bought
