('long', 'Where')

as long as I have access to the code
Where official policy is to catch and release

over the long time up in the sky
Where I take my liesure

there was no walking along the pleasure
Where I lead gravity

without longer damage
Where in me did I host

already formerly a long time
Where I host my purposes

already formely a long time
Where in me did I last

and it doesnâ€™t take long
Where in me did I lose

formerly along time they were on
