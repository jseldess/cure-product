('long', 'while')

as long as I have access to the code
Looking back while I should be sleeping

over the long time up in the sky
while wrapped in static

without the long time I was accounting
while wrapped in explicit static

The long time I was a vision
while weâ€™re wrapped in static

which is the long time I was on
while consuming damage

without longer damage
I answered while interfaced

in the long time they were on
for a while to listen already
