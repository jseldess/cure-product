('long', 'about')

as long as I have access to the code
burrowed about from repeated travels

already formerly a long time
and literally moved about

formerly a long time they were on
answered about 

formerly along time they were on
I answered about

and it doesnâ€™t take long
which I feel formerly about for

in the long time they were on
I answered what I thought about

shone formerly along time
about
