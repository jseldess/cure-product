('long', 'act')

as long as I have access to the code
One day was actually

bring your child along
I was enjoined to act again myself

over the long time up in the sky
I was enjoined to act again

over the long line up in the sky
and strategies not tactics

I argued the days felt longer
Not goals or tactics

The days long aligned
I was enjoying acting against myself

I argued the days were longer
I am bid to act again

The days are long
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
I am enjoined to act again

The days were long
actually considering the end

The long time I had a vision
I refuse indelible tracts

without the long time I was accounting
though not many facts up in the sky

The long time I was a vision
we had inhabited actually

already formerly a long time
to the ends of my transactions

formerly a long time they were on
The ends of my transactions

and it doesnâ€™t take long
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

formerly along time they were on
to the ends of actions

shone formerly a long time
I turn not sad exactly

in the long time they were on
I return not sad exactly
