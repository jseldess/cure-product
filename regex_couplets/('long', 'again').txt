('long', 'again')

as long as I have access to the code
at any time it can drift again

bring your child along
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

over the long time up in the sky
I was enjoined to act again myself

over the long line up in the sky
I keep turning back again myself

over the long line I would honor
blue and sun again a second, then night

I argued the days felt longer
I am bid to act again

The days long aligned
I was enjoying acting against myself

I argued the days were longer
I am enjoined to act again

The days are long
I was bid to act again myself

The days were long
I let it remind me again

without longer damage
