('long', 'agreed')

as long as I have access to the code
and to which I’ve agreed

already formerly a long time
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

already formely a long time
and for which the plan agreed

formerly a long time they were on
that agreed one of rest

formerly along time they were on
that agreed home
