('long', 'along')

as long as I have access to the code
bring your child along

bearing children along
and bear children along

over the long time up in the sky
The days lined along company

The days are long
there was no walking along the pleasure

there was no walking along
no solid ground to continue along

and continue along having 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

walking along the measure
walking from home along the measure

The long time I had a vision
formerly along time they were on

shone formerly a long time
formerly along my say to the elections

drawn formerly a long time
drawn formerly along 

formerly a long time
along cables

mostly along cables
shone formerly along time

formerly along the time they were on
