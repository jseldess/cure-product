('long', 'also')

as long as I have access to the code
You can hear it also through your leisure

bring your child along
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

The long time I had a vision
I cannot clear it also through investiture

without the long time I was accounting
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

The long time I was a vision
also didnâ€™t really move

in the long time they were on
