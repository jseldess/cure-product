as long as I have access to the code
for the duration of the answer

and it doesnâ€™t take long

formerly along time they were on
I answered what I thought

shone formerly a long time
I answered about

along cables
at least for the duration of the answer

in the long time they were on
I answered while interfaced

shone formerly along time
