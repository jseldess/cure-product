('long', 'answered')

as long as I have access to the code
answered about 

already formerly a long time
by the sight of the hosting answered about

formerly along time they were on
I answered what I thought

shone formerly a long time
I answered about

and it doesnâ€™t take long
I answered while interfaced

in the long time they were on
