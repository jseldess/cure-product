('long', 'any')

as long as I have access to the code
at any time it can drift again

bring your child along
Or the company

over the long time up in the sky
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I argued the days felt longer
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I agrued the days were longer
The entire company

The days long aligned
Since I had to hold the entire company

I argued the days were longer
The days aligned for company

The days are long
The days aligned long company

The days lined along company
That company creates a life

The days were long
there wasn’t any television 

The long time I had a vision
not many face up

without the long time I was accounting
though not many facts up in the sky

The long time I was a vision
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

without longer damage
without any further damage

without any longer damage
to any consumer damage

already formerly a long time
Or alter of course the time anyway

formerly a long time they were on
if there is anything 

already formely a long time
latency which doesn’t mean anything

formerly along time they were on
The many transparent pixel calls

shone formerly a long time
or imagined anyway

in the long time they were on
