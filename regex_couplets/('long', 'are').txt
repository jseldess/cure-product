('long', 'are')

as long as I have access to the code
Though there are quarters goals

bring your child along
who are so fresh and agile

over the long time up in the sky
There are quarterly goals

over the long line up in the sky
barely outlines

I argued the days felt longer
They are called aspirational

The days long aligned
The days are long

The days were long
I had nightmares though

I argued that the days were longer
but they are black spots

The long time I had a vision
I believe I can prepare for it

without the long time I was accounting
There are spots waiting

without longer damage
Though we are waiting for her

already formerly a long time
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

already formely a long time
Though we are breaking

and it doesnâ€™t take long
Though we are waiting 

formerly a long time they were on
still carefully

formerly along time they were on
There are constant ways

shone formerly a long time
That are my right to say

in the long time they were on
careening between the preambles
