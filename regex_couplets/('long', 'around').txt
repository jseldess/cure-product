('long', 'around')

as long as I have access to the code
Spinning around the heart

over the long time up in the sky
around my country 

The long time I had a vision
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

without longer damage
More reasons around my country 

already formely a long time
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

and it doesnâ€™t take long
and around redundant

already formerly a long time
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

shone formerly a long time
