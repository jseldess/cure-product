('long', 'aspiration')

as long as I have access to the code
They are called aspirational

I argued the days felt longer
with little reasons to aspiration

The days long aligned
embodied aspirations

The days were long aligned
with little reason to aspiration

The days are long
full of aspirations

The days were long
