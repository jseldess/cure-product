('long', 'brought')

as long as I have access to the code
I brought my head down

over the long time up in the sky
own stays brought loyal

already formerly a long time
own that stays brought loyal

shone formerly a long time
that stays brought loyal

and it doesnâ€™t take long
at home brought into privacy
