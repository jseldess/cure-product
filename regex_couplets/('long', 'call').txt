('long', 'call')

as long as I have access to the code
though it was most emphatically that

over the long time up in the sky
They are called aspirational

I argued the days felt longer
Which can be called confidence

The long time I had a vision
to take the call

and it doesnâ€™t take long
The many transparent pixel calls

shone formerly a long time
recalling aside

in the long time they were on
