('long', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

as long as I have access to the code
I can’t fix them without direction

bring your child along
Then I can’t presume to need others

over the long time up in the sky
That can’t be glimpsed

I argued the days felt longer
Though we can’t help waiting

shone formerly a long time
I can’t remember them

in the long time they were on
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
