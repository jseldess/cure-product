('long', 'code')

as long as I have access to the code
May I have your zip code

over the long time up in the sky
learned without too much difficulty to code

I argued the days felt longer
falling off the encoded end

The long time I had a vision
encoded off the end

without the long time I was accounting
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

without longer damage
zipcode

shone formerly a long time
