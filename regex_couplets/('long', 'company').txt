('long', 'company')

as long as I have access to the code
Or the company

over the long time up in the sky
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I argued the days felt longer
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I agrued the days were longer
The entire company

The days long aligned
Since I had to hold the entire company

I argued the days were longer
The days aligned for company

The days are long
The days aligned long company

The days lined along company
That company creates a life

The days were long
