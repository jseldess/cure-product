('long', 'continue')

as long as I have access to the code
but it continued

The days long aligned
but it continued rippling muscle

The days were long aligned
no solid ground to continue along

there was no walking along
and continue along having 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
I continue to presume

without longer damage
I continued to dream then

without any longer damage
