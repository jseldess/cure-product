('long', 'could')

as long as I have access to the code
and could be mapped and weighed

over the long time up in the sky
until I could not tire 

The long time I had a vision
until I could not be tired

without the long time I was accounting
until I could not be hired

which is the long time I was on
I could in effect credit

in the long time they were on
I could consume the dream

without longer damage
and we could inhabit the room easy

already formerly a long time
and could be inflected with reasons
