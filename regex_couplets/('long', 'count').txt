('long', 'count')

as long as I have access to the code
Then I constellate my time family country

bring your child along
So I constellate the time family country

over the long time up in the sky
I brought my count down

over the long line up in the sky
without the long time I was accounting

there was no walking along the pleasure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

The long time I had a vision
around my country 

The long time I was a vision
without the long time I was on accounting

without accounting the long time I was on
without accounting for credit

which is the long time I was on
More reasons around my country 

already formely a long time
