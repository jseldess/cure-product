('long', 'data')

as long as I have access to the code
I’ll pull my data higher up

over the long time up in the sky
I’ll pull my data

over the long line up in the sky
The days of private data

The days are long
The days of public data

The days were long
trackers collecting data on users

already formely a long time
my interfaced stand data

in the long time they were on
my standing in data

shone formerly along time
