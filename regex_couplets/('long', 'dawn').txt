('long', 'dawn')

as long as I have access to the code
Forecasting the story before dawn

over the long time up in the sky
battery dawn nights blending themselves

the long time I was on
dawn already formerly nights 

formerly a long time they were on
dawn formerly

and it doesnâ€™t take long
with dawn already formerly nights 

already formerly a long time
battery dawn nights 

shone formerly a long time
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in the long time they were on
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

drawn formerly along
