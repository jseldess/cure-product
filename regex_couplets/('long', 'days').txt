('long', 'days')

as long as I have access to the code
I argued the days felt longer

The days long aligned
I argued the days were longer

I agrued the days were longer
The days aligned for company

The days are long
The days were long

I argued that the days were longer
The days were long aligned

The days aligned long company
The days lined along company

The long time I had a vision
at least most days

in the long time they were on
