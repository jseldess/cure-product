('long', 'decision')

as long as I have access to the code
the planning process for decisions

I argued the days felt longer
attributable decisions

without longer damage
forgetting decisions 

already formerly a long time
decisioned to learn 

shone formerly a long time
decisioned to learn back

and it doesnâ€™t take long
decisions that can be attributable
