('long', 'do')

as long as I have access to the code
does not feel an exception

bring your child along
What does it mean to drift

and bear children along
in a sharp downward turn 

over the long time up in the sky
The dogs and lillies

over the long line up in the sky
I brought my head down

over the long line I would honor
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

I argued the days felt longer
What I do in my liesure

The long time I had a vision
Undoubtedly 

there was no walking along the pleasure
I walk up and don’t work anymore

The long time I was a vision
here is the site of the battle of maldon

without longer damage
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

already formerly a long time
and it doesn’t take long

formerly a long time they were on
latency which doesn’t mean anything

formerly along time they were on
I only think I don’t listen
