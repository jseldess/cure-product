('long', 'earn')

as long as I have access to the code
When we had jobs that were to earn

over the long time up in the sky
learned without too much difficulty to code

I argued the days felt longer
where you can earn more 

and continue along having 
decisioned to learn 

already formerly a long time
decisioned to learn back

shone formerly a long time
phase decision for learning

and it doesnâ€™t take long
I learned my location

in the long time they were on
I learned my point
