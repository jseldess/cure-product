('long', 'eat')

as long as I have access to the code
But I can’t let myself treat 

bring your child along
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

over the long time up in the sky
executive breath

over the long line up in the sky
was not just a defeat

over the long line I would honor
of the habits I create

I argued the days felt longer
of the habits they create

The days long aligned
of the habits they create.

I argued the days were longer
That company creates a life

The days are long
it was not just a defeat

The long time I had a vision
And from that great distance

without longer damage
for the creation of the universe

and it doesn’t take long
burrowed about from repeated travels

already formerly a long time
from cables reheated travels

along cables
