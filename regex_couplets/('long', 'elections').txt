('long', 'elections')

as long as I have access to the code
on my way to elections

already formerly a long time
formerly my way to the elections

shone formerly a long time
on a way to the elections

formerly along time they were on
formerly along my say to the elections

drawn formerly a long time
formally a way to the elections

and it doesnâ€™t take long
My say to the elections

in the long time they were on
