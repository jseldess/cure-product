('long', 'else')

as long as I have access to the code
If you have confidence regardless all else

over the long time up in the sky
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

without longer damage
and elsewhere my memory

already formely a long time
elsewhere by my memory

already formerly a long time
By my memory elsewhere

and it doesnâ€™t take long
in memory elsewhere

in the long time they were on
but for memory elsewhere

shone formerly along time
