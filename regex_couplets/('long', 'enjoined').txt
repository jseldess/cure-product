('long', 'enjoined')

as long as I have access to the code
I was enjoined to act again myself

over the long time up in the sky
I was enjoined to act again

over the long line up in the sky
I was enjoined to act

I argued the days were longer
I am enjoined to act again

The days long aligned
I was enjoined to act against

The days are long
