('long', 'enter')

as long as I have access to the code
The sun high enough to enter directly 

The long time I had a vision
I enter the flattening mirror

without the long time I was on accounting
I have entered my purposes

already formely a long time
I have entered my phone

already formerly a long time
I had entered my phone

in the long time they were on
