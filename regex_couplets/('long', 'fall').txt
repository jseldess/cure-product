('long', 'fall')

as long as I have access to the code
Then fall then summer

bring your child along
and not falling at all

over the long time up in the sky
Face falling off the edge of the face

over the long line up in the sky
The value falling off the edge of th face

over the long line I would honor
I see only the back of falling values

I argued the days felt longer
I see the back of falling values

The days long aligned
falling off the encoded end

The long time I had a vision
I take it out in the snow fall

there was no walking along the pleasure
falling off the end

without the long time I was accounting
falling off the end of the world

The long time I was a vision
