('long', 'feel')

as long as I have access to the code
does not feel an exception

bring your child along
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I argued the days felt longer
I tried to feel the extension of key values

The days long aligned
What would I feel without that goal

there was no walking along the pleasure
But my not feeling the memory aside

already formely a long time
But my not feeling the memory inside

and it doesnâ€™t take long
which feels most comfortable

already formerly a long time
which feels more comfortable

formerly a long time they were on
which is what feels most comfortable

formerly along time they were on
By my feeling the memory inside

shone formerly a long time
which I feel formerly about for

along cables
