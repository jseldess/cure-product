('long', 'form')

as long as I have access to the code
There are performance reviews

over the long time up in the sky
Toward the start informally given my reasons

The long time I had a vision
already formerly a long time

formerly a long time they were on
A way formerly like this one

already formely a long time
in the form filled offered in trust

and it doesnâ€™t take long
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

formerly along time they were on
formerly a way

shone formerly a long time
formerly my way to the elections

formerly along my say to the elections
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
drawn formerly along 

formerly a long time
formally a way to the elections

along cables
which I feel formerly about for

in the long time they were on
addition were filters formerly

shone formerly along time
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

formerly along the time they were on
own best form
