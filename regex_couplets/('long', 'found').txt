('long', 'found')

as long as I have access to the code
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

already formely a long time
and found inundated

already formerly a long time
and found redundant

and it doesnâ€™t take long
and latency found

formerly a long time they were on
So I found myself at home
