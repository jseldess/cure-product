('long', 'from')

as long as I have access to the code
Falling from this distance

over the long time up in the sky
drifting away from the task

over the long line up in the sky
A person from a distance

over the long line I would honor
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I argued the days felt longer
aside from the retinas

I argued that the days were longer
from which to step off

The days were long aligned
promoting from home to a new job

there was no walking along
promoting from home

no solid ground to continue along
from home

walking along the measure
walking from home along the measure

The long time I had a vision
I get from here through there

without longer damage
breaking from my constituents

and it doesnâ€™t take long
and relive from burrowed travels

already formerly a long time
from no one point

along cables
radiating from housing

in the long time they were on
shone from the housing

shone formerly along time
