('long', 'front')

as long as I have access to the code
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

over the long time up in the sky
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

I argued the days felt longer
in front of the set afternoon

The days long aligned
And need out in front purchase

without longer damage
behind or out front or up above

in the long time they were on
