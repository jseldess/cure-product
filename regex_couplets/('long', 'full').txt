('long', 'full')

as long as I have access to the code
I am full of potential

The days are long
with full potential to movement

The days long aligned
full of aspirations

The days were long aligned
full of potential

The days were long
full of the missing words

already formerly a long time
still carefully

formerly along time they were on
