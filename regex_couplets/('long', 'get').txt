('long', 'get')

as long as I have access to the code
I’ll get there eventually

bring your child along
I’ll get there ruins

over the long time up in the sky
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

I argued the days felt longer
I get through there

the long time I was on
I get from here through there

without longer damage
forgetting decisions 

already formerly a long time
forgettable
