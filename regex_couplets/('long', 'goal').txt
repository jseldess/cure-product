('long', 'goal')

as long as I have access to the code
Though there are quarters goals

bring your child along
There are quarterly goals

over the long time up in the sky
before morning goals

I argued the days felt longer
not goals

The days long aligned
What would I feel without that goal

there was no walking along the pleasure
