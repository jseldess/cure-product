('long', 'had')

as long as I have access to the code
If he had not carried one virtue

over the long time up in the sky
I had me a vision

I argued the days felt longer
Since I had to hold the entire company

The days long aligned
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

The days are long
I had to tell them the news

The days were long aligned
The long time I had a vision

without the long time I was accounting
I had a vision

which is the long time I was on
we had to say goodbye

without longer damage
so that nothing had gravity

without any longer damage
we had inhabited actually

already formerly a long time
in the space that it had

formerly a long time they were on
in the face that I had

already formely a long time
which had on honor to be told

formerly along time they were on
I had entered my phone

in the long time they were on
