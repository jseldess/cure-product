('long', 'has')

as long as I have access to the code
It has been since

over the long time up in the sky
in traversing my purchase

The long time I had a vision
purchased out

without longer damage
if that has anything

already formely a long time
For my own purchases

already formerly a long time
impulse for my own purchases

and it doesnâ€™t take long
phase decisioned by the prospect

shone formerly a long time
phase decisioned

along cables
at the site of a purchase

in the long time they were on
which as tracked befitted phased
