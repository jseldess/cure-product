('long', 'have')

as long as I have access to the code
if you have providence to excess

over the long time up in the sky
If you have confidence regardless all else

The long time I had a vision
I have them lost

in the long time they were on
I have supporters

without longer damage
I have a memory between the day

already formerly a long time
I have entered my purposes

already formely a long time
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

formerly along time they were on
I have turned it off

shone formerly a long time
I have entered my phone

and it doesnâ€™t take long
I have them trust in me
