('long', 'he')

as long as I have access to the code
or the incoming stream

bring your child along
without imparting the cynicism

bearing children along
the drifting is not something special

over the long time up in the sky
I’ll get there eventually

over the long line up in the sky
over the long line I would honor

over the long time I was on
until my purpose up in the sky

I argued the days felt longer
and testing the edge and gravity

The days long aligned
I argued the days were longer

I agrued the days were longer
when watching tv

The days are long
across the retinas

The days were long
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
or argued for them at least

The days were long aligned
The days aligned long company

The days lined along company
The days of public quantity

The long time I had a vision
without the long time I was accounting

there was no walking along the pleasure
there was no promotion

there was no walking along
where you can earn more 

and continue along having 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

walking along the measure
walking from home along the measure

The long time I was a vision
until I purpose the horizon

which is the long time I was on
talking into percents bending themselves

without the long time I was on accounting
without accounting the long time I was on

the long time I was on
they were on

in the long time they were on
I have them lost

without longer damage
I continued to dream then

without any longer damage
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

already formerly a long time
to the ends of my transactions

formerly a long time they were on
if there is anything 

already formely a long time
I stand and retrieve the impulse

and it doesn’t take long
But my not feeling the memory aside

formerly along time they were on
I speak them of my possessions

shone formerly a long time
formerly my way to the elections

formerly along my say to the elections
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
time they were on

formerly a long time
on a way to the elections

along cables
where I am aside increased

mostly along cables
where I am aside

shone formerly along time
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

drawn formerly along 
formally a way to the elections

formerly along the time they were on
My say to the elections
