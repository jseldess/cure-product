('long', 'hear')

as long as I have access to the code
You can hear it also through your leisure

bring your child along
and my heart rate

over the long time up in the sky
I hear it between bills and stuff

I argued the days felt longer
I can hear it between bills and stuff

The long time I had a vision
that I can hear

without the long time I was accounting
as far back as my history heard

The long time I was a vision
In my heart did I lose trust

already formerly a long time
