('long', 'here')

as long as I have access to the code
One day there is direction

bring your child along
I’ll get there eventually

over the long time up in the sky
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

over the long line up in the sky
there was no promotion

I argued the days felt longer
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
that potential is there for you

The days are long
Where I take my liesure

there was no walking along the pleasure
there was no walking along

no solid ground to continue along
where you can earn more 

and continue along having 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

walking along the measure
there wasn’t any television 

The long time I had a vision
there was no television to hear

without the long time I was accounting
but where is it

The long time I was a vision
I get through there

the long time I was on
I get from here through there

without longer damage
here is the site of the battle of maldon

already formerly a long time
Where in me did I host

formerly a long time they were on
if there is anything 

already formely a long time
where I send and relive aside

and it doesn’t take long
where I send and retrieve relive

formerly along time they were on
Is there a baby and a bear

shone formerly a long time
where rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
By my memory elsewhere

along cables
where I am aside increased

mostly along cables
where I am aside

in the long time they were on
but for memory elsewhere

shone formerly along time
where lights blended themselves

drawn formerly along 
my ethereal economic relations
