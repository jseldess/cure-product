('long', 'high')

as long as I have access to the code
way high up in the inter

over the long time up in the sky
Iâ€™ll pull my data higher up

over the long line up in the sky
higher up in the results

over the long line I would honor
your bid to the next highest ranked network

I argued the days felt longer
The sun high enough to enter directly 

The long time I had a vision
The sun high enough to strike directly
