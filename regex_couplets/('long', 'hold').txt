('long', 'hold')

as long as I have access to the code
I take hold of my finger

over the long time up in the sky
Since I had to hold the entire company

The days long aligned
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

The days are long
and hold and wish to hold

in the long time they were on
designed to hold up my underwear

without longer damage
