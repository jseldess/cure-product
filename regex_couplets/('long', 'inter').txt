('long', 'inter')

as long as I have access to the code
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

bring your child along
way high up in the inter

over the long time up in the sky
higher up in the internet

over the long line up in the sky
hold at intervals riding forward

over the long line I would honor
with internally regulated climate

I argued the days felt longer
Then I saw them interview

The long time I had a vision
my interfaced stand data

in the long time they were on
I interfaced

shone formerly along time
 as points which are my interest
