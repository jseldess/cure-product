('long', 'into')

as long as I have access to the code
into the stream of pictures

bring your child along
into a brigand and a murderer

over the long time up in the sky
into the well controlled climate

I argued the days felt longer
into the next level head

The days long aligned
talking into pheasants bending themselves

The long time I had a vision
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

without the long time I was accounting
Then I saw into you

The long time I was a vision
talking into percents bending themselves

which is the long time I was on
wearing trying talking into it

without the long time I was on accounting
walking into percents blending themselves

the long time I was on
entered into my purposes

already formely a long time
deep into pathways from repeated travels

already formerly a long time
stopping into the prospect

formerly a long time they were on
step by into the prospect

shone formerly a long time
converting sight into a purchase

and it doesn’t take long
into liminal reflexing
