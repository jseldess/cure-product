('long', 'just')

as long as I have access to the code
Theyâ€™re just not mine

bring your child along
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

over the long time up in the sky
was not just a defeat

over the long line up in the sky
I just got a letter

I argued the days felt longer
it was not just a defeat

The long time I had a vision
