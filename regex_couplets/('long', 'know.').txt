('long', 'know.')

as long as I have access to the code
how can I know without direction

bring your child along
I even know what I would find

The long time I had a vision
even when close to my knowing

without longer damage
knowing the constituents

already formerly a long time
who knows the way

formerly along time they were on
who knows how to turn it off

shone formerly a long time
that their knowing
