('long', 'learn')

as long as I have access to the code
I spend time online learning to code

over the long time up in the sky
learned without too much difficulty to code

I argued the days felt longer
decisioned to learn 

already formerly a long time
decisioned to learn back

shone formerly a long time
phase decision for learning

and it doesnâ€™t take long
I learned my location

in the long time they were on
I learned my point
