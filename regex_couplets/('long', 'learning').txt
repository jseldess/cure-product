('long', 'learning')

as long as I have access to the code
I spend time online learning to code

over the long time up in the sky
Then I am learning to code

I argued the days felt longer
phase decision for learning

shone formerly a long time
for learning by the prospect

and it doesnâ€™t take long
a precision for learning
