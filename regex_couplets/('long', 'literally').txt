('long', 'literally')

as long as I have access to the code
and literally moved

already formely a long time
and literally unproved

already formerly a long time
myself moved literally as it is

formerly a long time they were on
and literally moved about

formerly along time they were on
not literally moved about

and it doesnâ€™t take long
not literally moved

in the long time they were on
