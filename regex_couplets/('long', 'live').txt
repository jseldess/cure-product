('long', 'live')

as long as I have access to the code
Which is a measure to never live out

bring your child along
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

over the long time up in the sky
Which is a pleasure to never live out

The long time I had a vision
where I send and relive aside

already formely a long time
where I stand and relive

already formerly a long time
where I send and relive

and it doesnâ€™t take long
where I send and retrieve relive

formerly a long time they were on
where I stand and retrieve relive

along cables
