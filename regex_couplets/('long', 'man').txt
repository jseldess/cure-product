('long', 'man')

as long as I have access to the code
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

bring your child along
Walt Whitman drifted

over the long time up in the sky
There are performance reviews

over the long line up in the sky
not many face up

The long time I had a vision
though not many facts up in the sky

without the long time I was accounting
in not many tracks up in the sky

The long time I was a vision
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

already formerly a long time
They have very many choices

already formely a long time
and that man comes on to tell me 

formerly along time they were on
The many transparent pixel calls

shone formerly a long time
