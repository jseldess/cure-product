('long', 'many')

as long as I have access to the code
not many face up

The long time I had a vision
though not many facts up in the sky

without the long time I was accounting
in not many tracks up in the sky

The long time I was a vision
They have very many choices

already formely a long time
The many transparent pixel calls

shone formerly a long time
