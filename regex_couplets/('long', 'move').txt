('long', 'move')

as long as I have access to the code
since I can imagine movement

The days are long
with little reason to move

The days were long
with little reasons to move

The days long aligned
with full potential to movement

I argued that the days were longer
since you can imagine movement

The days were long aligned
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

without longer damage
and literally moved

already formely a long time
myself moved literally as it is

already formerly a long time
and move them literally with me

formerly a long time they were on
and literally moved about

formerly along time they were on
not literally moved about

and it doesn’t take long
also didn’t really move

in the long time they were on
not literally moved
