('long', 'moved')

as long as I have access to the code
and literally moved

already formely a long time
myself moved literally as it is

already formerly a long time
and literally moved about

formerly a long time they were on
I literally moved

formerly along time they were on
not literally moved about

and it doesnâ€™t take long
not literally moved

in the long time they were on
