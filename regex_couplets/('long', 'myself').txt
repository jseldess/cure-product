('long', 'myself')

as long as I have access to the code
But I can’t let myself treat 

bring your child along
I’ll pull myself another personality type

over the long time up in the sky
I was enjoined to act again myself

over the long line up in the sky
I keep turning back again myself

over the long line I would honor
off the end myself

The days long aligned
I was enjoying acting against myself

I argued the days were longer
I was bid to act again myself

The days are long
myself

already formerly a long time
the least productive of myself

in the long time they were on
So I find myself at home
