('long', 'need')

as long as I have access to the code
and can’t presume to need

bring your child along
drifting away needs

over the long time up in the sky
I need the work

The long time I had a vision
I need an explicit statement

without the long time I was accounting
which I needed for an explicit state

The long time I was a vision
And need out in front purchase

without longer damage
not needing to wait

already formerly a long time
without really needing

formerly a long time they were on
in need one in that best own

formerly along time they were on
need one in best own

shone formerly a long time
that in need one best own

and it doesn’t take long
