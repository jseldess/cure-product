('long', 'night')

as long as I have access to the code
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

over the long time up in the sky
blue and sun again a second, then night

I argued the days felt longer
I had nightmares though

The days long aligned
battery dawn nights blending themselves

the long time I was on
dawn already formerly nights 

formerly a long time they were on
last night

already formerly a long time
with dawn already formerly nights 

formerly along time they were on
battery dawn nights 

shone formerly a long time
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in the long time they were on
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
