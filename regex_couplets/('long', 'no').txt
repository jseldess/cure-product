('long', 'no')

as long as I have access to the code
on a snow day with my children

bring your child along
the drifting is not something special

over the long time up in the sky
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

over the long line up in the sky
over the long line I would honor

over the long time I was on
Then I cannot see face value

I argued the days felt longer
and strategies not tactics

The days long aligned
that their economic value 

I argued the days were longer
there was no promotion

I agrued the days were longer
I take it out in the snow fall

there was no walking along the pleasure
there was no walking along

no solid ground to continue along
because there was no solid ground to continue along

walking along the measure
may not be ingrained

The long time I had a vision
may not be engrained

without the long time I was accounting
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

The long time I was a vision
until I could not be tired

which is the long time I was on
even when close to my knowing

without longer damage
so that nothing had gravity

without any longer damage
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

already formerly a long time
The sun high enough to enter directly

already formely a long time
But my not feeling the memory aside

and it doesn’t take long
not needing to wait

formerly a long time they were on
and it’s not literal

formerly along time they were on
But my not feeling the memory inside

shone formerly a long time
who knows the way

along cables
But my not 

in the long time they were on
between cereal and economic
