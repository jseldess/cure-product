('long', 'nor')

as long as I have access to the code
into the minority proportion of time

bring your child along
over the long line I would honor

over the long time up in the sky
nor work in this way daily

over the long line up in the sky
the simple act of honoring an accountant

The long time I had a vision
nor envy honest work

already formely a long time
which had on honor to be told

already formerly a long time
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

shone formerly a long time
