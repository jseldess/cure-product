('long', 'now')

as long as I have access to the code
on a snow day with my children

bring your child along
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

over the long time up in the sky
out in the snow

over the long line up in the sky
out in the snow fall

I argued the days felt longer
out in the snow falling face value

The days long aligned
I take it out in the snow fall

there was no walking along the pleasure
I even know what I would find

The long time I had a vision
even when close to my knowing

without longer damage
knowing the constituents

already formerly a long time
who knows the way

formerly along time they were on
who knows how to turn it off

shone formerly a long time
that their knowing
