('long', 'off')

as long as I have access to the code
I step off the edge

bring your child along
off the edge of the world

over the long time up in the sky
I am first in the office 

over the long line up in the sky
I am the first in the office

over the long line I would honor
Coffe and

over the long time I was on
off the end of the world

I argued the days felt longer
off the end myself

The days long aligned
off the end

I argued the days were longer
from which to step off

The days were long aligned
falling off the encoded end

The long time I had a vision
falling off the end

without the long time I was accounting
eroded off the end

The long time I was a vision
Sweets and coffee and juice

without longer damage
in the form filled offered in trust

already formerly a long time
in the form filled offered trust

formerly along time they were on
in track as offer asked 

shone formerly a long time
iced coffee and sun position

in the long time they were on
I assume the offers reliable
