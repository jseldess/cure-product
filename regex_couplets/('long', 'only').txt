('long', 'only')

as long as I have access to the code
only fragments of time with my children

bring your child along
only in the case

over the long time up in the sky
So that I notice I am the only one

I argued the days felt longer
The planning process is for visionaries only

The days long aligned
would only willingly break

already formerly a long time
if only on the way to the trash
