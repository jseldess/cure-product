('long', 'other')

as long as I have access to the code
others desires

bring your child along
I’ll pull myself another personality type

over the long time up in the sky
Then I can’t presume to need others

over the long line up in the sky
On the other hand

The long time I had a vision
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

without longer damage
and other types of tracking technology

already formely a long time
I presume to others

already formerly a long time
to the other end

shone formerly a long time
Cereal and others’ health

in the long time they were on
I assume possession to others
