('long', 'our')

as long as I have access to the code
You can hear it also through your leisure

bring your child along
reasons resources

over the long time up in the sky
Two hours and

over the long line up in the sky
with four key value pairs

I argued the days felt longer
your bid to the next highest ranked network

The days long aligned
or alter of course the time anyway

already formerly a long time
This is your voice 

already formely a long time
Who throws contours away

shone formerly a long time
phrase them of our possessions
