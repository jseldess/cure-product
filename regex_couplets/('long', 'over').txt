('long', 'over')

as long as I have access to the code
I step over the edge

bring your child along
over the long time up in the sky

over the long line up in the sky
over the long line I would honor

over the long time I was on
oddly grown over with historic bark

I argued the days felt longer
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

The long time I had a vision
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

without longer damage
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

already formely a long time
for not paying sound overwhelmed

already formerly a long time
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
