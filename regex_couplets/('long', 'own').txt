('long', 'own')

as long as I have access to the code
in a sharp downward turn 

bring your child along
to the down arrow

over the long time up in the sky
I brought my head down

over the long line up in the sky
oddly grown over with historic bark

I argued the days felt longer
even when close to my owning

without longer damage
the impulse for my own prospects

already formely a long time
For my own purchases

already formerly a long time
the impulse my own prospects

and it doesnâ€™t take long
own stays brought loyal

formerly a long time they were on
in need one in that best own

shone formerly a long time
own that stays brought loyal

along cables
for my own purposes

in the long time they were on
state reflexing indented in my own
