('long', 'plan')

as long as I have access to the code
and is relentlessly planned

bring your child along
The planning process for visions

I argued the days felt longer
The planning process is for visionaries only

The days long aligned
and for which the plan agreed

already formerly a long time
and to which the plan agreed

formerly along time they were on
