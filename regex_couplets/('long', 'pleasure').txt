('long', 'pleasure')

as long as I have access to the code
Which is a pleasure to never live out

over the long time up in the sky
there was no walking along the pleasure

there was no walking along
up in the television pleasure

The long time I had a vision
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

without the long time I was accounting
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

The long time I was a vision
