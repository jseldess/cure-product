('long', 'possession')

as long as I have access to the code
I speak to them my possessions

formerly a long time they were on
my possession of my children

already formerly a long time
I speak them of my possessions

shone formerly a long time
speech my possession of my children

and it doesnâ€™t take long
I stay the right of my possessions 

in the long time they were on
possessions people
