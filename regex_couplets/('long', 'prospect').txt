('long', 'prospect')

as long as I have access to the code
the impulse for my own prospects

already formely a long time
the impulse my own prospects

already formerly a long time
stopping into the prospect

formerly a long time they were on
speech that is of by prospects

shone formerly a long time
decisioned by the prospect

and it doesnâ€™t take long
The prospects there already
