('long', 'purpose')

as long as I have access to the code
by no ventillation my purpose

over the long line up in the sky
until my purpose up in the sky

over the long time up in the sky
until I purpose the horizon

without the long time I was accounting
of my purpose in versing

the long time I was on
in traversing my purpose

in the long time they were on
in conversing of my purpose

without longer damage
Where I host my purposes

already formely a long time
the impulse for my own purposes

already formerly a long time
the impulse to my purpose

and it doesnâ€™t take long
to the other end of my purpose

shone formerly a long time
aside the impulse to my purpose

along cables
for my own purposes
