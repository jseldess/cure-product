('long', 'really')

as long as I have access to the code
When they really take hold of my finger

over the long time up in the sky
without really agreeing

already formely a long time
without really speaking

already formerly a long time
without really branding 

formerly a long time they were on
without really needing

formerly along time they were on
also didnâ€™t really move

in the long time they were on
