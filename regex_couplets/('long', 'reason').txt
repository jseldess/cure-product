('long', 'reason')

as long as I have access to the code
reasons resources

bring your child along
with reasons

over the long time up in the sky
with little reason to move

The days were long
with little reasons to aspiration

The days long aligned
with little reasons to move

The days were long aligned
with little reason to aspiration

The days are long
embodied with little reason

The long time I had a vision
Toward the start informally given my reasons

The long time I was a vision
More reasons around my country 

already formely a long time
and could be inflected with reasons
