('long', 'relive')

as long as I have access to the code
where I send and relive aside

already formely a long time
where I stand and relive

already formerly a long time
where I send and relive

and it doesnâ€™t take long
where I send and retrieve relive

formerly a long time they were on
where I stand and retrieve relive

along cables
