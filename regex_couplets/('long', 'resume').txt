('long', 'resume')

as long as I have access to the code
and can’t presume to need

bring your child along
Then I can’t presume to need others

over the long time up in the sky
I resume unassimilable visions

The long time I had a vision
I resume indelible tracks

without the long time I was accounting
I resume attributable visions

The long time I was a vision
I continue to presume

without longer damage
I presume to others

already formerly a long time
So I presume the offers already
