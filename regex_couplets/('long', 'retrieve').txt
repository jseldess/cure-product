('long', 'retrieve')

as long as I have access to the code
I send and retrieve the impulse

already formely a long time
I stand and retrieve the impulse

already formerly a long time
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

and it doesnâ€™t take long
where I send and retrieve relive

formerly a long time they were on
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

shone formerly a long time
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

along cables
