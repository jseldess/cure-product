('long', 'ring')

as long as I have access to the code
interferring 

bring your child along
bearing children along

and bear children along
ring

over the long time up in the sky
hovering above standing water

over the long line up in the sky
actually considering the end

The long time I had a vision
the simple act of honoring an accountant

without the long time I was accounting
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

which is the long time I was on
wearing trying talking into it

without the long time I was on accounting
storing in surfeit

without longer damage
firing and connecting somewhere

already formerly a long time
The prospect for veering healthily
