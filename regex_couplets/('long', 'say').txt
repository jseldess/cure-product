('long', 'say')

as long as I have access to the code
we had to say goodbye

without longer damage
I ask say in that case

already formerly a long time
we ask say in that case

shone formerly a long time
formerly along my say to the elections

drawn formerly a long time
I ask say in that phase decisioned

and it doesnâ€™t take long
My say to the elections

in the long time they were on
