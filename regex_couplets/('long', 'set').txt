('long', 'set')

as long as I have access to the code
upset by Gingrich

over the long time up in the sky
in front of the set afternoon

I argued the days felt longer
in front of the set of regulations

The days long aligned
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

already formerly a long time
Um, upset by Gingrich

already formely a long time
presets
