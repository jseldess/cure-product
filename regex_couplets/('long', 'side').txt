('long', 'side')

as long as I have access to the code
I’m simply inside

bring your child along
aside from the retinas

I argued that the days were longer
actually considering the end

The long time I had a vision
But my not feeling the memory aside

already formely a long time
where I send and relive aside

already formerly a long time
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

and it doesn’t take long
where I am aside

formerly a long time they were on
by the side of the hosting service

formerly along time they were on
But my not feeling the memory inside

shone formerly a long time
where I send and retrieve aside

along cables
where I am aside increased

mostly along cables
where I am aside at least

in the long time they were on
