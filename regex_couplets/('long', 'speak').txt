('long', 'speak')

as long as I have access to the code
not speaking

already formely a long time
without really speaking

already formerly a long time
I speak to them

and it doesnâ€™t take long
would only speak willingly

formerly a long time they were on
I speak to them my possessions

formerly along time they were on
I speak them of my possessions

shone formerly a long time
speak them of my possessions

along cables
