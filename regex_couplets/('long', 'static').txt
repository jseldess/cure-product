('long', 'static')

as long as I have access to the code
wrapped in static and explicit statements

The long time I had a vision
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

without the long time I was accounting
You can hear it also through static leisure

The long time I was a vision
while weâ€™re wrapped in static

which is the long time I was on
