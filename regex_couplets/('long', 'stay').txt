('long', 'stay')

as long as I have access to the code
wrestling to stay still

bring your child along
So stay with us

The days are long
own stays brought loyal

already formerly a long time
own that stays brought loyal

shone formerly a long time
that stays brought loyal

and it doesnâ€™t take long
I stay the right of my elections

in the long time they were on
home stays brought loyal
