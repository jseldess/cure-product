('long', 'step')

as long as I have access to the code
I step off the edge

bring your child along
What the next step

I argued the days felt longer
What’s the next step

The days long aligned
from which to step off

The days were long aligned
step in by the prospect

shone formerly a long time
phase decision step in

and it doesn’t take long
step by into the prospect
