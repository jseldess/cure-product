('long', 'take')

as long as I have access to the code
I take hold of my finger

over the long time up in the sky
If I take a different measure

The long time I had a vision
Where I take my liesure

there was no walking along the pleasure
If I take some different measure

without the long time I was accounting
I take it out in the snow fall

The long time I was a vision
to take the call

and it doesnâ€™t take long
