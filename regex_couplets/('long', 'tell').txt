('long', 'tell')

as long as I have access to the code
Then I constellate my time family country

bring your child along
So I constellate the time family country

over the long time up in the sky
I constellate the time

over the long line up in the sky
I had to tell them the news

The days were long aligned
I tell you my purposes

without longer damage
and that man comes on to tell me 

already formerly a long time
