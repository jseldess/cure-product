('long', 'their')

as long as I have access to the code
We can wrestle them with their goals

bring your child along
I am not allowed to see their face

I argued the days felt longer
increasingly that their economic value

The days long aligned
that their economic value 

I argued the days were longer
without their agreement

formerly a long time they were on
to their other end

shone formerly a long time
that their knowing
