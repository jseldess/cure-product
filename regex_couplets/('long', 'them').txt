('long', 'them')

as long as I have access to the code
I can’t fix them without direction

bring your child along
In a continuous theme

over the long time up in the sky
or argued for them at least

The days long aligned
I had to tell them the news

The days were long aligned
talking into pheasants bending themselves

The long time I had a vision
I can hear them between bills and stuff

without the long time I was accounting
but I can hear them

The long time I was a vision
talking into percents bending themselves

which is the long time I was on
walking into percents blending themselves

the long time I was on
I have them lost

in the long time they were on
I designed them to hold up my underwear

without longer damage
Then I saw them interview

already formely a long time
I speak to them

and it doesn’t take long
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

already formerly a long time
I speak to them my possessions

formerly a long time they were on
I speak them of my possessions

formerly along time they were on
speak them of my possessions

shone formerly a long time
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
phrase them of my possessions

along cables
battery dawn nights blending themselves

shone formerly along time
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

drawn formerly along 
abjure them with determining
