('long', 'themselves')

as long as I have access to the code
talking into pheasants bending themselves

The long time I had a vision
talking into percents bending themselves

without the long time I was accounting
walking into percents blending themselves

the long time I was on
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

and it doesnâ€™t take long
battery dawn nights blending themselves

already formerly a long time
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in the long time they were on
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

shone formerly a long time
where rights ended themselves

drawn formerly along
