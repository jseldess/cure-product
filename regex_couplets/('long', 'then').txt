('long', 'then')

as long as I have access to the code
Then fall then summer

bring your child along
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

over the long time up in the sky
blue and sun again a second, then night

I argued the days felt longer
then I cannot see face value

The days long aligned
Then I continue to dream then

without longer damage
I continued to dream then

without any longer damage
