('long', 'through')

as long as I have access to the code
You can hear it also through your leisure

bring your child along
Back up through the results

over the long time up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

The long time I had a vision
I cannot clear it also through investiture

without the long time I was accounting
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

The long time I was a vision
I get through there

the long time I was on
I get from here through there

without longer damage
