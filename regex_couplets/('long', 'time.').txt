('long', 'time.')

as long as I have access to the code
only fragments of time with my children

bring your child along
over the long time up in the sky

over the long line up in the sky
over the time line I was on

over the long line I would honor
So I constellate the time family country

over the long time I was on
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

I argued the days felt longer
The long time I had a vision

without the long time I was accounting
The long time I was a vision

which is the long time I was on
without the long time I was on accounting

without accounting the long time I was on
the long time I was on

in the long time they were on
or alter of course the time anyway

already formerly a long time
formerly a long time they were on

already formely a long time
until a happier time found

formerly along time they were on
time they were on

drawn formerly a long time
formerly along the time they were on
