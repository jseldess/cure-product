('long', 'tire')

as long as I have access to the code
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I agrued the days were longer
The entire company

The days long aligned
Since I had to hold the entire company

I argued the days were longer
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

The days are long
until I could not tire 

The long time I had a vision
until I could not be tired

without the long time I was accounting
for to tire as far back as my history

The long time I was a vision
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

already formerly a long time
