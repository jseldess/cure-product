('long', 'track')

as long as I have access to the code
I reuse indelible tracks 

The long time I had a vision
The first track

without the long time I was accounting
I refuse indelible tracks

The long time I was a vision
and other types of tracking technology

already formely a long time
which as tracked befitted 

already formerly a long time
which as tracked befitted phased

shone formerly a long time
sizes track for asking sound

and it doesnâ€™t take long
sizes asking for tracking sound
