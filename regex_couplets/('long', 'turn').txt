('long', 'turn')

as long as I have access to the code
in a sharp downward turn 

bring your child along
sudden downward turn

over the long time up in the sky
I keep turning back again myself

over the long line up in the sky
who knows how to turn it off

shone formerly a long time
I turn not sad exactly

in the long time they were on
I return not sad exactly
