('long', 'until')

as long as I have access to the code
until my purpose up in the sky

over the long time up in the sky
until I could not tire 

The long time I had a vision
until I could not be tired

without the long time I was accounting
until I could not be hired

which is the long time I was on
until I purpose up in the sky

without longer damage
until the bill came

without any longer damage
until a happier time found

already formerly a long time
