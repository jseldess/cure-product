('long', 'up?')

as long as I have access to the code
The sun isn’t up 

bring your child along
without imparting the cynicism

bearing children along
Puffs of air

over the long time up in the sky
I’ll get there eventually

over the long line up in the sky
over the long line I would honor

over the long time I was on
until my purpose up in the sky

I argued the days felt longer
of my economic value

The days long aligned
I argued the days were longer

I agrued the days were longer
And as an extension of the values

The days are long
I argued that the days were longer

The days were long
or argued for them at least

The days were long aligned
The days of public quantity

The long time I had a vision
without the long time I was accounting

there was no walking along the pleasure
no solid ground to continue along

there was no walking along
where you can earn more 

and continue along having 
and support digestion

because there was no solid ground to continue along
walking along the measure

walking from home along the measure
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

The long time I was a vision
until I could not be tired

which is the long time I was on
I resume attributable visions

without the long time I was on accounting
without accounting the long time I was on

the long time I was on
I could in effect credit

in the long time they were on
I have them trust in me

without longer damage
I continued to dream then

without any longer damage
to any consumer damage

already formerly a long time
We had inhabited actually

formerly a long time they were on
without really agreeing

already formely a long time
I stand and retrieve the impulse

and it doesn’t take long
But my not feeling the memory aside

formerly along time they were on
I presume to others

shone formerly a long time
I thought

formerly along my say to the elections
I answered what I thought

drawn formerly a long time
I assumed what I draw

along cables
the least productive of myself

shone formerly along time
about
