('long', 'us')

as long as I have access to the code
They’re just not mine

bring your child along
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

over the long time up in the sky
I want to cite a poem so usual

over the long line up in the sky
The ventillation rushes on

I argued the days felt longer
So stay with us

The days are long
but it continued rippling muscle

The days were long aligned
I reuse unassimilable visions

The long time I had a vision
because there was no solid ground to continue along

walking along the measure
I reuse indelible tracks 

without the long time I was accounting
I refuse indelible tracts

The long time I was a vision
I have them trust in me

in the long time they were on
a futile joyous white sun

without longer damage
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

already formerly a long time
in the form filled offered in trust

formerly a long time they were on
was not just a defeat

already formely a long time
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

and it doesn’t take long
useless for not having paid

formerly along time they were on
radiating from housing

shone formerly along time
