('long', 'use')

as long as I have access to the code
You use the most essential parts

over the long time up in the sky
I reuse unassimilable visions

The long time I had a vision
because there was no solid ground to continue along

walking along the measure
I reuse indelible tracks 

without the long time I was accounting
I refuse indelible tracts

The long time I was a vision
I used my technology

without longer damage
trackers collecting data on users

already formely a long time
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

already formerly a long time
useless for not having paid

formerly a long time they were on
