('long', 'very')

as long as I have access to the code
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I argued the days felt longer
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I agrued the days were longer
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
embodied everyday

The days are long
They have very many choices

already formely a long time
