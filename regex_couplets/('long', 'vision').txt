('long', 'vision')

as long as I have access to the code
I had me a vision

over the long time up in the sky
The planning process for visions

I argued the days felt longer
The planning process is for visionaries only

The days long aligned
aspirating visions

I agrued the days were longer
aspirating with visions

I argued the days were longer
embodied with little visions

The days are long
little visions

The days were long aligned
aspirating with little visions

The days were long
I aspirate with little vision

The long time I had a vision
there wasnâ€™t any television 

without the long time I was accounting
I resume unassimilable visions

The long time I was a vision
I had a vision

which is the long time I was on
I resume attributable visions

without the long time I was on accounting
attributable visions

without longer damage
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

already formerly a long time
joined in my television

in the long time they were on
visions that can be attainable
