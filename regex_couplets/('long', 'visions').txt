('long', 'visions')

as long as I have access to the code
The planning process for visions

I argued the days felt longer
aspirating visions

The days long aligned
aspirating with visions

I argued the days were longer
embodied with little visions

The days are long
little visions

The days were long aligned
aspirating with little visions

The days were long
I reuse unassimilable visions

The long time I had a vision
I resume unassimilable visions

without the long time I was accounting
I resume attributable visions

The long time I was a vision
attributable visions

without longer damage
visions that can be attainable
