('long', 'wait')

as long as I have access to the code
There are spots waiting

without longer damage
Though we are waiting for her

already formerly a long time
not needing to wait

formerly a long time they were on
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

shone formerly a long time
waiting out front or up above 

in the long time they were on
