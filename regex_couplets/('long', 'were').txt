('long', 'were')

as long as I have access to the code
When we had jobs that were to earn

over the long time up in the sky
I argued the days were longer

I agrued the days were longer
The days were long

I argued that the days were longer
The days were long aligned

The days aligned long company
they were on

in the long time they were on
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

already formerly a long time
formerly a long time they were on

already formely a long time
answered about 

formerly along time they were on
I answered what I thought

shone formerly a long time
time they were on

drawn formerly a long time
I answered about

and it doesnâ€™t take long
I answered while interfaced

shone formerly along time
formerly along the time they were on
