('long', 'Which')

as long as I have access to the code
Which is a measure to never live out

bring your child along
Which can be pronounced to the world

over the long time up in the sky
Which is a pleasure to never live out

The long time I had a vision
Which can be called confidence

already formely a long time
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

already formerly a long time
