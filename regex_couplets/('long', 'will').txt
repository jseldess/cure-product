('long', 'will')

as long as I have access to the code
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

bring your child along
will not be the same

The long time I had a vision
that will spur me on

without longer damage
would only willingly break

already formerly a long time
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

formerly along time they were on
my daughter will learn 

shone formerly a long time
