('long', 'work')

as long as I have access to the code
nor work in this way daily

over the long time up in the sky
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I argued the days felt longer
your bid to the next highest ranked network

The days long aligned
I need the work

The long time I had a vision
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

The long time I was a vision
nor envy honest work

already formely a long time
