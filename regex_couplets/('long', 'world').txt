('long', 'world')

as long as I have access to the code
off the edge of the world

over the long time up in the sky
Which can be pronounced to the world

over the long line up in the sky
off the end of the world

I argued the days felt longer
hauling off the end of the world

The long time I had a vision
falling off the end of the world

without the long time I was accounting
the opinions in my world

already formerly a long time
