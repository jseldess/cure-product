('long', 'You')

as long as I have access to the code
You can hear it also through your leisure

bring your child along
You use the most essential parts

over the long time up in the sky
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

The long time I had a vision
You can hear it also through static leisure

without the long time I was accounting
You need history

The long time I was a vision
You can have seen offering
