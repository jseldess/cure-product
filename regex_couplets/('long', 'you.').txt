('long', 'you.')

as long as I have access to the code
Though how can you know without direction

bring your child along
You can hear it also through your leisure

over the long time up in the sky
if you have providence to excess

over the long line up in the sky
That you can see only the back of

I argued the days felt longer
your bid to the next highest ranked network

The days long aligned
since you can imagine movement

The days are long
where you can earn more 

and continue along having 
If you have confidence regardless all else

The long time I had a vision
you need history

The long time I was a vision
a futile joyous white sun

without longer damage
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

already formerly a long time
This is your voice 

already formely a long time
the young ripples inaudibly
