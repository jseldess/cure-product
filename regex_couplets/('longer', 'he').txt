('longer', 'he')

I argued the days felt longer
and testing the edge and gravity

I argued the days were longer
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I agrued the days were longer
when watching tv

I argued that the days were longer
or argued for them at least

without longer damage
I continued to dream then

without any longer damage
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
