('longer', 'joined')

I argued the days felt longer
I was enjoined to act again myself

I argued the days were longer
I was enjoined to act

I agrued the days were longer
I am enjoined to act again

I argued that the days were longer
I was enjoined to act against

without longer damage
joined in my television
