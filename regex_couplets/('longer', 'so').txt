('longer', 'so')

I argued the days felt longer
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I argued the days were longer
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I agrued the days were longer
My associations

I argued that the days were longer
with little reasons to aspiration

without longer damage
so that nothing had gravity

without any longer damage
some sort of a futile joyous white sun
