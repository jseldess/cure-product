('longer', 'tire')

I argued the days felt longer
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I agrued the days were longer
The entire company

I argued the days were longer
Since I had to hold the entire company

I argued that the days were longer
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

without longer damage
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
