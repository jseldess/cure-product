('lose', 'up?')

even when close to my owning
If I take some different measure

even when close to my knowing
of my purpose in conversing

even when closed
in conversing of my purpose

Where in me did I lose
in the form filled offered in trust

Where in me did I lose trust
In my heart did I lose trust

In what part did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

Where did we lose trust
though we are waiting for her
