('low', 'earn')

slow
in light of learning what we see

slow asynchronous
When we had jobs that were to earn

low in the content architecture
I spend time online learning to code

Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
learned without too much difficulty to code

I am not allowed to see their face
where you can earn more 

under pillowing a cloud
decisioned to learn
