('low', 'eat')

slow
too sunny to eat ice cream

slow asynchronous
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

to the pillow
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

low in the content architecture
Where I put it beating

Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
executive breath

I am not allowed to see their face
of the habits they create

under pillowing a cloud
And from that great distance
