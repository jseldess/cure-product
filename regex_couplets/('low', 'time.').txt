('low', 'time.')

slow
Itâ€™s time to wake up, Papa!

slow asynchronous
where I sleep at times

to the pillow
over the long time up in the sky

low in the content architecture
I spend time online learning to code

Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
On the timeline I was on

I am not allowed to see their face
The long time I had a vision

under pillowing a cloud
without the long time I was on accounting
