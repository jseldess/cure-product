('low', 'up?')

slow
Itâ€™s time to wake up, Papa!

slow asynchronous
but not impart cynicism

to the pillow
sudden downward turn

low in the content architecture
Where I put it beating

Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture
of later ruins

out from below the fold
out of the fifth page ruins

I am not allowed to see their face
of the economic value

under pillowing a cloud
under pillowing a loud 

billowing in the cloud
without the long time I was on accounting
