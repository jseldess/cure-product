('man', 'bill')

as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
I hear it between bills and stuff

not many face up
I can hear them between bills and stuff

though not many facts up in the sky
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

in not many tracks up in the sky
I cannot hear it between bills

Though in not many acts
between bills and stuffed animals

that of the man with the dyed blond hair
the bill my detuning
