('man', 'blend')

as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
battery dawn nights blending themselves

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
walking into percents blending themselves

that of the man with the dyed blond hair
where I blend and relive

and that man comes on to tell me 
where lights blended themselves
