('man', 'come')

as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
Strategy comes before morning

not many face up
and that man comes on to tell me 

The many transparent pixel calls
and come home to remind inflections
