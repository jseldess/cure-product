('man', 'count')

as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
Then I constellate my time family country

To my children Walt Whitman
So I constellate the time family country

not many face up
without the long time I was accounting

though not many facts up in the sky
the simple act of honoring an accountant

that of the man with the dyed blond hair
More reasons around my country 

They have very many choices
