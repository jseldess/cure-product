('man', 'eat')

as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
too sunny to eat ice cream

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

To my children Walt Whitman
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

not many face up
it was not just a defeat

that of the man with the dyed blond hair
was not just a defeat

They have very many choices
for the creation of the universe

and that man comes on to tell me 
burrowed about from repeated travels
