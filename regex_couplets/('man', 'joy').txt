('man', 'joy')

as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
I was enjoying acting against myself

not many face up
a futile joyous white sun

that of the man with the dyed blond hair
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

They have very many choices
