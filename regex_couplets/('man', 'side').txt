('man', 'side')

as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
aside from the retinas

not many face up
But my not feeling the memory aside

They have very many choices
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

and that man comes on to tell me 
by the side of the hosting service

The many transparent pixel calls
But my not feeling the memory inside
