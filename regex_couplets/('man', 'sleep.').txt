('man', 'sleep.')

as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
where I sleep at times

To my children Walt Whitman
That’s where I sleep at times

not many face up
like flattening sleep 

that of the man with the dyed blond hair
