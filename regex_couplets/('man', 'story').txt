('man', 'story')

as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
I told her a story, she drew waves.

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
Forecasting the story before dawn

not many face up
as far back as my history heard

though not many facts up in the sky
You need history

that of the man with the dyed blond hair
