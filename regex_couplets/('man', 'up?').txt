('man', 'up?')

as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
I assumed it was visible

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
as a cure to my children

To my children Walt Whitman
slow asynchronous

Walt Whitman
But not to impart cynicism

What Whitman
Without imparting cynicism 

Walt Whitman drifted
Puffs of air

There are performance reviews
And as an extension of the values

not many face up
black spots on a white surface

though not many freeze up
white spots on a black surface

though not many face up
up in the television pleasure

though not many facts up in the sky
I resume unassimilable visions

in not many tracks up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Though in not many acts
Though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts
Though it is not many simple acts

that of the man with the dyed blond hair
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

They have very many choices
The trackers on users

and that man comes on to tell me 
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

The many transparent pixel calls
But my not feeling the memory inside
