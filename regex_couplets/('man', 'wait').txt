('man', 'wait')

as a cure my exception Walt Whitman
There are spots waiting

that of the man with the dyed blond hair
Though we are waiting for her

They have very many choices
not needing to wait

and that man comes on to tell me 
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

The many transparent pixel calls
waiting out front or up above
