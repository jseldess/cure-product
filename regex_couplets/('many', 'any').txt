('many', 'any')

not many face up
though not many freeze up

though not many face up
though not many facts up in the sky

in not many tracks up in the sky
Though in not many acts

Though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

Though it is not many simple acts
I walk up and don’t work anymore

They have very many choices
latency which doesn’t mean anything

The many transparent pixel calls
The many transparent pixels call

of the many transparent pixel calls
or imagined anyway
