('many', 'bill')

not many face up
I can hear them between bills and stuff

though not many facts up in the sky
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

in not many tracks up in the sky
I cannot hear it between bills

Though in not many acts
between bills and stuffed animals

They have very many choices
the bill my detuning
