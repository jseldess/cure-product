('many', 'clear')

not many face up
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

though not many facts up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through investiture

in not many tracks up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Though in not many acts
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

They have very many choices
