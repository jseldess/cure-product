('many', 'he')

not many face up
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

though not many freeze up
up in the television pleasure

though not many facts up in the sky
talking into pheasants bending themselves

in not many tracks up in the sky
there was no television to hear

Though in not many acts
Though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts
not the simple act

They have very many choices
The trackers on users

The many transparent pixel calls
who know the way to their other end

The many transparent pixels call
to the other end

of the many transparent pixel calls
But my not feeling the memory inside
