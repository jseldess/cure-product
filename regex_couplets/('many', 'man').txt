('many', 'man')

not many face up
though not many freeze up

though not many face up
though not many facts up in the sky

in not many tracks up in the sky
Though in not many acts

Though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

Though it is not many simple acts
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

They have very many choices
and that man comes on to tell me 

The many transparent pixel calls
The many transparent pixels call

of the many transparent pixel calls
