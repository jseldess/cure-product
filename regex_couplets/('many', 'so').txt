('many', 'so')

not many face up
If I take some different measure

though not many facts up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

in not many tracks up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Though in not many acts
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

They have very many choices
sound inundated for my own purchases

The many transparent pixel calls
by in the sound privacy
