('many', 'time.')

not many face up
The long time I had a vision

though not many facts up in the sky
without the long time I was accounting

in not many tracks up in the sky
So I constellate the time family country

They have very many choices
until a happier time found

The many transparent pixel calls
formerly along time they were on
