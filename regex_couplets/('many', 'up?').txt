('many', 'up?')

not many face up
black spots on a white surface

though not many freeze up
white spots on a black surface

though not many face up
up in the television pleasure

though not many facts up in the sky
I resume unassimilable visions

in not many tracks up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Though in not many acts
Though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts
Though it is not many simple acts

They have very many choices
The trackers on users

The many transparent pixel calls
But my not feeling the memory inside
