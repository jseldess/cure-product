('me', 'And')

Where I sleep at times
And put in place as though stationary

wrestling me to stay still
And as an extension of the values

Then I canâ€™t presume to need others
And make myself a visible

on the time line I was on
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I came after my past
And we had to say goodbye to her there

For an ungraspable time
And need out in front purchase

And for an ungraspable time
And reached up the screen

I had me a vision
And from a weak distance

I came back to me
And from that great distance

or in some imaginary elsewhere
And we could inhabit the room easy

Or alter of course the time anyway
