('me', 'As')

Where I sleep at times
Ask who I am to suspend

I assumed it was visible
Ask who I am

into the minority proportion of time
As though stationary and a destination

wrestling me to stay still
Assimilable or

 and time in the train
Aspirational strategy

I had me a vision
As an extension of the values

with full potential to movement
As a clone, illegally conceived

I came after my past
