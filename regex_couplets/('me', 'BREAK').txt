('me', 'break')

Where I sleep at times
though we are still breaking in

A way formerly like this one
though we are breaking in the space that it had

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
Though we are breaking 

already formely a long time
without really breaking

already formerly a long time
breaking from my constituents

But my not feeling the memory inside
would only willingly break

for not paying sound overwhelmed
