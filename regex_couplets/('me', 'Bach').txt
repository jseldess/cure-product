('me', 'Bach')

Where I sleep at times
I end up in Bach 

already formerly a long time
I end up in Bach and Selma

Formerly a way like this one
I end up Bach

But my not feeling the memory inside
Bach helps turn it off

formerly a way
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

The other end of means
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

By my feeling the memory inside
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

Formerly away there are constant ways
I end up Bach forty-one seconds in

formerly my way
