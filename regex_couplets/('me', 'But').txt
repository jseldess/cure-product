('me', 'but')

Where I sleep at times
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

I assumed it was visible
but not impart cynicism

Then fall then summer
I want but not to impart cynicism

Which is a measure to never live out
Attributable or

 and time in the train
but the sun isn’t up

Strategy comes before goals
but it continued

I had me a vision
but it continued rippling muscle

with full potential to movement
but would I love her the same

If I take a different measure
but they are black spots

I resume unassimilable visions
but I can hear them

If I take some different measure
I resume attributable visions

The long time I had a vision
but where is it

The long time I was a vision
attributable visions

I continue to presume
of attributable visions

I continue to subsume
that decisions can be attributable

A way formerly like this one
but for memory elsewhere

in memory persisting elsewhere
but standing in memory

shone formerly along time
decisions that can be attributable

that agreed home
revisions that can be attributable

brought messageable to you
but I own all that’s messageable

I presume the offers
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
in that decisions can be attributable

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
