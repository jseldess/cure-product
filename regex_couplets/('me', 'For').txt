('me', 'For')

Where I sleep at times
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I constellate my time family country
For whom drifting is not an exception

What does it mean to drift
Forecasting the story before dawn

summer
For an ungraspable time

And for an ungraspable time
For Mitt Romney

and elsewhere my memory of you
For my own purchases

But my not feeling the memory aside
Formerly a way like this one

But my not feeling the memory inside
Formerly away there are constant ways

By my feeling the memory inside
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

The other end of means
Forty-one seconds in

formerly a way
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

All that I own messageable
