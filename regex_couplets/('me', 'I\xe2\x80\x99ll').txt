('me', 'I\xe2\x80\x99ll')

Where I sleep at times
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Then I constellate my time family country
I’ll get there eventually

Which is a measure to never live out
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

over the long time up in the sky
I’ll pull my data higher up

on the time line I was on
I’ll get there ruins

Then fall then summer
I’ll pull myself higher up

summer
I’ll pull my data

over the time line I was on
