('me', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

Where I sleep at times
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

I assumed it was visible
I’m simply inside

only fragments of time with my children
Right now I’m the cart

over the long time up in the sky
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

Strategy comes before morning
where I’m watching my tv

But my feeling the memory aside
