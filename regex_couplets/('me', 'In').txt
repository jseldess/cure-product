Where I sleep at times
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

Then fall then summer

By NATASHA SINGER

A way formerly like this one
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

already formerly a long time
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

But my not feeling the memory inside
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

Formerly a way like this one
