('me', 'It')

Where I sleep at times
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

I assumed it was visible
It keeps coming down thankfully

Then fall then summer
It has been since

Then I can’t presume to need others
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

Strategy comes before morning
It’s morning 

Its strategy comes before morning goals
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

I had me a vision
It’s not marshal exactly

But my not feeling the memory inside
It’s not marshall exactly

formerly a way like this one
