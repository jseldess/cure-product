('me', 'My')

Where I sleep at times
My live connections to you

I assumed it was visible
My associations

since I can imagine movement
My purpose up in the sky

For an ungraspable time
My means without gravity

without consumer damage
My daughter with her way

A way formerly like this one
My daughter helps too

But my not feeling the memory inside
My say to the elections

which I feel formerly about for
My state kept loaned impression

I have them trust in me
