('me', 'On')

Where I sleep at times
On a snow day with my children

Then I constellate my time family country
One day there is direction

Then fall then summer
On a day there will be direction

wrestling me to stay still
One year or

 and time in the train
On the bandwidth I was on

and the graph ahead of me
On the timeline I was on

The timeline
On the other hand

explicit statements
One was up where it should be down

And for an ungraspable time
