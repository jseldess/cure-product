('me', 'THE')

Where I sleep at times
THE SNOW

over the long time up in the sky
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

Then fall then summer
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

over the long time I was on
THE PLANNING PROCESS

Strategy comes before morning
UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON

Strategy comes before goals
THE OFFERS

I had me a vision
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
