('me', 'That')

Where I sleep at times
That’s exaclty what I want for them

only fragments of time with my children
That is itself not still

wrestling me to stay still
That’s where I sleep at times

in a moment of drifting away from the task
That’s when they really take

In a continuous theme
That you can see only the back of

I had me a vision
That company creates a life

with full potential to movement
That I captured an afterimage

without consumer damage
That are my right to say

which I feel formerly about for
