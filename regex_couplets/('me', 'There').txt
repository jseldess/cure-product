('me', 'There')

Where I sleep at times
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

All of the time
There are quarterly goals

Then I can’t presume to need others
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

So I constellate the time family country
There was very little physical activity

Since I can imagine movement
There are spots waiting

or in some imaginary elsewhere
There are constant ways

Formerly a way like this one
There are no constant waves

But my not feeling the memory inside
There are no constant ways

By my feeling the memory inside
