('me', 'Thou')

Where I sleep at times
Though there are quarters goals

wrestling me to stay still
Though how can you know without direction

Then fall then summer
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

If I take a different measure
Though in not many acts

I resume attributable visions
Though we are waiting for her

already formerly a long time
Though we are breaking 

already formely a long time
Though we are waiting 

Where in me did I host
Though we can’t help waiting

But my not feeling the memory inside
