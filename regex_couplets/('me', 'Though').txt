('me', 'though')

Where I sleep at times
As though stationary and a destination

wrestling me to stay still
though there are quarters with goals

Then fall then summer
though it was most emphatically that

I constellate the time
I had nightmares though

since I can imagine movement
though not many freeze up

explicit statements
though not many facts up in the sky

I resume unassimilable visions
though as for conversing

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
though in not many acts up in the sky

I resume attributable visions
I thought

already formerly a long time
though we are still breaking in

A way formerly like this one
though we are breaking in the space that it had

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
after though there’s no memory

Where in me did I loose
though we are waiting for her

I assumed 
I answered what I thought

shone formerly a long time
I answered what I thought about

in the long time they were on
