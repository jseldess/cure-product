('me', 'To')

Where I sleep at times
To my children Walt Whitman

Then fall then summer
To my chidren

What does it mean to drift
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

So I constellate the time family country
To neither study

 and time in the train
To that impossible place

emerging this year from standing water
Tomorrow

Strategy comes before morning
Toward the start informally given my reasons

The long time I had a vision
To substitute neither study

and elsewhere my memory of you
To the ends of transactions

already formerly a long time
To the ends of my transactions

formerly a way like this one
To the other end of transactions

But my not feeling the memory inside
To the other end of my actions

By my feeling the memory inside
To the other end of transactions like this

To the other end of means like this one
To the right of determined elections

which I feel formerly about for
