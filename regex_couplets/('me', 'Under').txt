('me', 'under')

Where I sleep at times
under pillowing a cloud

without the long time I was on accounting
under the last seen principle

I resume attributable visions
she lay under the grass

For an ungraspable time
under the grasp principle

And for an ungraspable time
designed to hold up my underwear

or in some imaginary elsewhere
