('me', 'what')

Where I sleep at times
a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i

Then fall then summer from my face
in light of learning what we see

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
That’s exaclty what I want for them

only fragments of time with my children
what I find there

Then fall then summer
I invited most of what came next

since I can imagine movement
I even know what I would find

will not be the same
what literally moved

Where in me did I lose
which is what feels most comfortable

latency which doesn’t mean anything
In what part did I lose trust

Where did I lose trust in me
I answered what I thought

shone formerly a long time
I assumed what I draw

formerly along time they were on
I answered what I thought about

in the long time they were on
to return what I bought

I have them trust in me
