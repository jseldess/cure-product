('me', 'Which')

Where I sleep at times
Which is a measure to never live out

and canâ€™t presume to need
Which can be pronounced to the world

So I constellate the time family country
Which is a pleasure to never live out

Then fall then summer
Which can be called confidence

 and time in the train
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

Where in me did I host
