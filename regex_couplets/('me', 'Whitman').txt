('me', 'Whitman')

Where I sleep at times
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

I assumed it was visible
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Then fall then summer
To my children Walt Whitman

Which is a measure to never live out
Walt Whitman

What does it mean to drift
Walt Whitman drifted

over the long time up in the sky
