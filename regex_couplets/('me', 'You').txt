('me', 'You')

Where I sleep at times
You should ask who I am

I assumed it was visible
You can hear it also through your leisure

Which is a measure to never live out
You use the most essential parts

In a continuous theme
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I resume attributable visions
You can hear it also through static leisure

If I take a different measure
You need history

The long time I had a vision
You can have seen offering

I assume possession to others
