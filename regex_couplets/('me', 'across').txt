('me', 'across')

Where I sleep at times
Before we walk across the wide field

Then I constellate my time family country
Before we walk across the wide opening

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Then fall then summer
Before anyone walks across the opening

only fragments of time with my children
across the retinas

Since I can imagine movement
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

advancing the time
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

I assumed that they were divisible
