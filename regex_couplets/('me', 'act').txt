('me', 'act')

Where I sleep at times
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Then fall then summer from my face
In the retroactive light

Then fall then summer
In the light of retroactive conversations

When I want something
before we can have a retroactive

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
One day was actually

wrestling me to stay still
I was enjoined to act again myself

Then I can’t presume to need others
I was enjoined to act again

emerging this year from standing water
and strategies not tactics

I had me a vision
I am bid to act again

since I can imagine movement
There was very little physical activity

with full potential to movement
I was enjoying acting against myself

since you can imagine movement
actually considering the end

I resume unassimilable visions
I refuse indelible tracts

explicit statements
though not many facts up in the sky

If I take a different measure
Though in not many acts

I resume attributable visions
we had inhabited actually

or alter of course the time anyway
to the ends of my transactions

I have a memory between the day
The ends of my transactions

But my not feeling the memory inside
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

Where in me did I host
To the ends of transactions

already formerly a long time
to the ends of actions

A way formerly like this one
It’s not marshal exactly

Formerly a way like this one
the other end transactions

formerly a way
to the other end of actions

The other end of means
The other end of transactions like this

By my feeling the memory inside
the other end of actions

Formerly away there are constant ways
To the other end of transactions like this

To the other end of means like this one
actions

formerly away
to the other end of transactions

formerly my way 
I turn not sad exactly

By my memory elsewhere
I return not sad exactly

which I feel formerly about for
I returned not sad exactly

I have them trust in me
before I act on them

So I presume the offers already
