('me', 'actions')

Where I sleep at times
conversations with our reactions

Then fall then summer
to the ends of my transactions

I have a memory between the day
The ends of my transactions

But my not feeling the memory inside
To the ends of transactions

already formerly a long time
to the ends of actions

A way formerly like this one
the other end transactions

Formerly a way like this one
to the other end of actions

formerly a way
of my actions

The other end of means
The other end of transactions like this

By my feeling the memory inside
the other end of actions

Formerly away there are constant ways
To the other end of transactions like this

To the other end of means like this one
actions

formerly away
to the other end of transactions

formerly my way
