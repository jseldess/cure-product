('me', 'agreed')

Where I sleep at times
and to which I’ve agreed

by my memory
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

already formely a long time
and for which the plan agreed

Where in me did I host
that agreed one of rest

Elsewhere by my memory
and to which the plan agreed

and that man comes on to tell me 
that agreed home

I can’t remember them
that agreed to one the people

home stays brought loyal
that agreed one best

the people in home form
that agreed home to people

home rest form to ourselves
