('me', 'along')

Where I sleep at times
bring your child along

What does it mean to drift
and bear children along

the drifting is not something special
The days lined along company

with full potential to movement
there was no walking along the pleasure

I had me a vision
there was no walking along

promoting from home
no solid ground to continue along

from home
walking along the measure

walking from home along the measure
formerly along time they were on

I presume to others
formerly along my say to the elections

formerly my way to the elections
drawn formerly along 

time they were on
along cables

But my not feeling the memory aside
mostly along cables

joined me in wasting my vision
shone formerly along time

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
formerly along the time they were on

which I feel formerly about for
