('me', 'also')

Where I sleep at times
You can hear it also through your leisure

Which is a measure to never live out
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

What was the last time
I cannot clear it also through investiture

I resume indelible tracks
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I resume attributable visions
You can hear it also through static leisure

If I take a different measure
also didnâ€™t really move

joined me in wasting my vision
