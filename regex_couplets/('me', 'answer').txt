('me', 'answer')

Where I sleep at times
for the duration of the answer

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
answered about 

But my not feeling the memory aside
the duration of answers

firing and connecting somewhere
for the duration of answers

for not paying sound overwhelmed
by the sight of the hosting answered about

by my memory 
I answered about

By my memory elsewhere
washed I answered about

washed by my memory
I answered what I thought

shone formerly a long time
at least for the duration of the answer

joined me in wasting my vision
I answered while interfaced

but for memory elsewhere
I answered what I thought about

in the long time they were on
