('me', 'answered')

Where I sleep at times
answered about 

But my not feeling the memory aside
by the sight of the hosting answered about

by my memory 
I answered about

By my memory elsewhere
washed I answered about

washed by my memory
I answered what I thought

shone formerly a long time
I answered while interfaced

but for memory elsewhere
I answered what I thought about

in the long time they were on
