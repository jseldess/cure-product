('me', 'are')

Where I sleep at times
Though there are quarters goals

wrestling me to stay still
there are quarters 

Then fall then summer
who are so fresh and agile

the drifting is not something special
There are quarterly goals

Then I can’t presume to need others
barely outlines

Strategy comes before morning
They are called aspirational

I had me a vision
The days are long

Since I can imagine movement
I had nightmares though

with full potential to movement
but they are black spots

I resume unassimilable visions
I believe I can prepare for it

will not be the same
There are spots waiting

or in some imaginary elsewhere
Though we are waiting for her

already formerly a long time
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

A way formerly like this one
though we are breaking in the space that it had

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
Though we are breaking 

already formely a long time
Though we are waiting 

Where in me did I host
still carefully

Where in me pre-worn
There are constant ways

Formerly a way like this one
Formerly away there are constant ways

But my not feeling the memory inside
The many transparent pixel calls

By my feeling the memory inside
That are my right to say

which I feel formerly about for
careening between the preambles

I presume the offers
