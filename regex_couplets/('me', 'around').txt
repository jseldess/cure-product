('me', 'around')

Where I sleep at times
Spinning around the heart

Then fall then summer
around my country 

The long time I had a vision
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I came after my past
Articles all around us

For an ungraspable time
articles all around storming around

And for an ungraspable time
around the dogs and lillies

I came back to me
I spin around

or in some imaginary elsewhere
More reasons around my country 

and elsewhere my memory of you
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

But my not feeling the memory inside
and around redundant

for not paying sound overwhelmed
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

Formerly a way like this one
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

formerly a way
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

The other end of means
