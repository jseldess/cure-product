('me', 'aside')

Where I sleep at times
aside from the retinas

Since I can imagine movement
But my not feeling the memory aside

and elsewhere my memory 
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

already formely a long time
where I send and relive aside

Where in me did I last
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

already formerly a long time
where I send and retrieve aside

Elsewhere my memory
where I stand aside

dawn formerly
where I am aside at least

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I am aside

firing and connecting somewhere
aside the impulse to my purpose

But my feeling the memory aside
where I am aside increased

joined me in wasting my vision
