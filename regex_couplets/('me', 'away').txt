('me', 'away')

Where I sleep at times
drifting away

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
drifting away needs

Then I can’t presume to feed others
drifting away from the task

in a moment of drifting away from the task
Who throws contours away

Formerly a way like this one
Formerly away there are constant ways

But my not feeling the memory inside
formerly away

formerly a way
