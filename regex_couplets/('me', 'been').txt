('me', 'been')

Where I sleep at times
It has been since

Then I canâ€™t presume to need others
After having been contented

So I constellate the time family country
that having been after content

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning
having been graspable

I continue to presume
having been an ungraspable time

I continue to consume
having been purchased out

I came after my past
having been purchased out of you

For an ungraspable time
