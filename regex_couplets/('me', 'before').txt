('me', 'Before')

Where I sleep at times
Before we walk across the wide field

Then I constellate my time family country
Before we walk across the wide opening

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Then fall then summer
Before anyone buys up the opening

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

only fragments of time with my children
Before morning goals

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

Its strategy comes before morning goals
