('me', 'blend')

Where I sleep at times
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Then fall then summer from my face
walking into percents blending themselves

If I take a different measure
where I blend and relive

for not paying sound overwhelmed
where lights blended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

drawn formerly rights blended themselves
