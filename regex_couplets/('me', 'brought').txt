('me', 'brought')

Where I sleep at times
at home brought into privacy

So I find myself at home
already brought into privacy

brought messageable to you
I brought my head down

Then fall then summer
I brought my qualities down

Some disease effecting the tree out front
which I brought down with qualities

In a continuous theme
I brought my count down

and the graph ahead of me
own stays brought loyal

Where in me did I host
own that stays brought loyal

A way formerly like this one
that stays brought loyal

By my memory elsewhere
home stays brought loyal

the people in home form
at home brought into private

So I presume the offers already
brought messageable into privacy

brought into private messageably
brought into privacy

I resume the offers at home
