('me', 'call')

Where I sleep at times
not calling or echoing for once

Then fall then summer from my face
though it was most emphatically that

I constellate the time
Which can be called confidence

 and time in the train
They are called aspirational

I had me a vision
to take the call

dawn formerly
The many transparent pixel calls

But my not feeling the memory inside
recalling aside

joined me in wasting my vision
