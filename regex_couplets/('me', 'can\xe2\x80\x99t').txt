('me', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

Where I sleep at times
I can’t fix them without direction

Then fall then summer
and can’t presume to need

Then I can’t presume to need others
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
But I can’t let myself treat 

Then I constellate my time family country
But I can’t let myself disregard

over the long time up in the sky
That can’t be glimpsed

I had me a vision
Though we can’t help waiting

But my not feeling the memory inside
I can’t remember them

I have them trust in me
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

I presume to others
