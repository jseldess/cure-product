('me', 'children')

Where I sleep at times
On a snow day with my children

Then I constellate my time family country
as pure as my children

I assumed it was visible
my children’s consumption

Then fall then summer from my face
about my children’s consumption

Then fall then summer
only fragments of time with my children

into the minority proportion of time
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Which is a measure to never live out
To my children Walt Whitman

What does it mean to drift
and bear children along

the drifting is not something special
Even the children

For an ungraspable time
my possession of my children

I presume to others
speech my possession of my children

A way formerly like this one
