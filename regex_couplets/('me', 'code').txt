('me', 'code')

Where I sleep at times
as long as I have access to the code

only fragments of time with my children
May I have your zip code

Then fall then summer
I spend time online learning to code

In a continuous theme
learned without too much difficulty to code

Strategy comes before morning
falling off the encoded end

but would I love her the same
encoded off the end

I resume unassimilable visions
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

And for an ungraspable time
Is the weight of my click or zipcode

I could consume the dream
zipcode

A way formerly like this one
