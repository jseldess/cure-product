('me', 'comes')

Where I sleep at times
Strategy comes before morning

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

Its strategy comes before morning goals
Strategy comes before goals

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
and that man comes on to tell me 

I had me a vision
