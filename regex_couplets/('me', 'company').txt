('me', 'company')

Where I sleep at times
Or the company

I spend time online learning to code
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I had me a vision
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

since I can imagine movement
The days aligned for company

with full potential to movement
The days aligned long company

since you can imagine movement
That company creates a life

Would I love the same stuff
