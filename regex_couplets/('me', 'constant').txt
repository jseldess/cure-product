('me', 'constant')

Where I sleep at times
with constant ways 

But my not feeling the memory inside
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

formerly a way
who throws a constant way

Formerly a way like this one
There are constant ways

The other end of means
Formerly away there are constant ways

By my feeling the memory inside
with constant ways to the other end

formerly my way
