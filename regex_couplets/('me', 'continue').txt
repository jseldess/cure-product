('me', 'continue')

Where I sleep at times
but it continued

I had me a vision
but it continued rippling muscle

with full potential to movement
no solid ground to continue along

promoting from home
and continue along having 

from home
I continue to presume

If I take a different measure
I continue to subsume

I continue to consume
Then I continue to dream then

I could consume the dream
Then I continued to dream then

I came after my past
I continued to dream then

And for an ungraspable time
