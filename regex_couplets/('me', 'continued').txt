('me', 'continued')

Where I sleep at times
but it continued

I had me a vision
but it continued rippling muscle

with full potential to movement
Then I continued to dream then

I could consume the dream
Then I continued to dream

I came after my past
I continued to dream then

And for an ungraspable time
