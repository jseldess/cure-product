('me', 'could')

Where I sleep at times
and could be mapped and weighed

Then fall then summer
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

a similar desire against me
until I could not tire 

What was the last time
until I could not be tired

I need an explicit statement
until I could not be hired

I resume attributable visions
I could in effect credit

If I take a different measure
I could consume the dream

I came back to me
and we could inhabit the room easy

or alter of course the time anyway
and could be inflected with reasons

and came home to rewind
