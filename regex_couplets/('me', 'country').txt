('me', 'country')

Where I sleep at times
Then I constellate my time family country

Itâ€™s time to wake up, Papa!
So I constellate the time family country

over the long time up in the sky
around my country 

The long time I had a vision
More reasons around my country 

and elsewhere my memory of you
