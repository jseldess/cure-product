('me', 'damage')

Where I sleep at times
without ensuing damage

I came after my past
while consuming damage

And for an ungraspable time
without consumer damage

My means without gravity
without longer damage

to any consumer damage
without any longer damage

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
