('me', 'data')

Where I sleep at times
I’ll pull my data higher up

on the time line I was on
I’ll pull my data

over the long time up in the sky
The days of private data

with full potential to movement
The days of public data

since you can imagine movement
trackers collecting data on users

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
my interfaced stand data

By my memory elsewhere
my standing in data

but for memory elsewhere
