('me', 'daughter')

Where I sleep at times
I love my daughter still

but would I love her the same
with my daughter

already formerly a long time
my daughter will learn 

A way formerly like this one
My daughter with her way

But my not feeling the memory inside
My daughter helps too

Formerly a way like this one
my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me

By my memory elsewhere
