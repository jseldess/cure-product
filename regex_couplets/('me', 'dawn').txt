('me', 'dawn')

Where I sleep at times
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Then fall then summer from my face
Forecasting the story before dawn

summer
dawn already formerly nights 

formerly a long time they were on
dawn formerly

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
with dawn already formerly nights 

by my memory
battery dawn nights 

But my not feeling the memory inside
to the other end battery dawn 

formerly a way
battery dawn 

Formerly a way like this one
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

By my feeling the memory inside
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in memory elsewhere
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

drawn formerly rights blended themselves
dawn formerly nights ended themselves

drawn formerly rights
