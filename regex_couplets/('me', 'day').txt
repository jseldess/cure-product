('me', 'day')

Where I sleep at times
On a snow day with my children

Then I constellate my time family country
One day there is direction

Then fall then summer
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

only fragments of time with my children
on a day there will be direction

wrestling me to stay still
I argued the days felt longer

I had me a vision
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

since I can imagine movement
The days are long

with full potential to movement
The days long aligned

since you can imagine movement
The days were long

Would I love the same stuff
The day

or alter of course the time anyway
between that day

already formerly a long time
I have a memory between the day

Where in me did I host
at least most days

But my not feeling the memory aside
