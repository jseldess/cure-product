('me', 'days')

Where I sleep at times
I argued the days felt longer

I had me a vision
The days long aligned

since I can imagine movement
The days are long

with full potential to movement
The days were long

since you can imagine movement
The days were long aligned

Would I love the same stuff
at least most days

But my not feeling the memory aside
