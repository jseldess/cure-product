('me', 'decision')

Where I sleep at times
the planning process for decisions

I had me a vision
attributable decisions

I continue to presume
forgetting decisions 

I presume to others
decisioned to learn 

Where in me did I host
decisioned to learn back

A way formerly like this one
decisioned by the prospect

By my memory elsewhere
decisions that can be attributable

that agreed home
phase decisioned by the prospect

I presume the offers
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
that decisions can be attributable

terms in that possessive canâ€™t be remembered
