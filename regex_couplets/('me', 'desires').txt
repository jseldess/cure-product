('me', 'desires')

Where I sleep at times
others desires

Then fall then summer
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
Others desires as legitimate

over the long time up in the sky
my desires were open

The CEO tells me to embody values
I wish my desires were open

and the graph ahead of me
