('me', 'direction')

Where I sleep at times
Whereas direction is beside the point

I assumed it was visible
into rotating directionless 

into the minority proportion of time
Of course there is a direction

When I want something
One day there is direction

Then fall then summer
on a day there will be direction

wrestling me to stay still
I canâ€™t fix them without direction

Which is a measure to never live out
stopping off in all directions

I assumed that they were divisible
