('me', 'directly')

Where I sleep at times
if not directly on my skin

When I want something
of not directly from my skin

only fragments of time with my children
But not to me directly

I spend time online learning to code
The sun high enough to enter directly 

advancing the time
The sun high enough to strike directly

I assumed that they were divisible
