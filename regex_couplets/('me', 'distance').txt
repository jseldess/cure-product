('me', 'distance')

Where I sleep at times
Falling from this distance

Then fall then summer
A person from a distance

The CEO tells me to embody values
dislocated and a person from a distance

In a continuous theme
And from a weak distance

And for an ungraspable time
And from that great distance

I came back to me
And from a great distance

or in some imaginary elsewhere
