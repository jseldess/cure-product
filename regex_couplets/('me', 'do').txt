('me', 'do')

Where I sleep at times
The dogs and lillies

I assumed it was visible
in a sharp downward turn 

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

into the minority proportion of time
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i
In a sharp downard turn

Then fall then summer from my face
It keeps coming down thankfully

Then fall then summer
does not feel an exception

Which is a measure to never live out
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I constellate my time family country
What does it mean to drift

the drifting is not something special
to the down arrow

That’s where I sleep at times
the down arrow

in a moment of drifting away from the task
sudden downward turn

over the long time up in the sky
I brought my head down

Some disease effecting the tree out front
I brought my qualities down

The CEO tells me to embody values
which I brought down with qualities

In a continuous theme
I put my bread down

and the graph ahead of me
I brought my count down

a similar desire against me
I put my head down

emerging this year from standing water
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

Strategy comes before morning
What I do in my liesure

The long time I had a vision
Undoubtedly 

But would I love her the same
I walk up and don’t work anymore

advancing the time
So I work and don’t look any

The long time I was a vision
here is the site of the battle of maldon

I came after my past
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

And for an ungraspable time
around the dogs and lillies

I came back to me
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

I could consume the dream
and it doesn’t take long

But my not feeling the memory aside
latency which doesn’t mean anything

until a happier time found
I only think I don’t listen

in privacy that is messageable
For a while I think I don’t listen

All that I own messageable
