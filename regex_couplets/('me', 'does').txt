('me', 'does')

Where I sleep at times
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

I assumed it was visible
does not feel an exception

Then fall then summer
drifting does not feel an exception

Which is a measure to never live out
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I constellate my time family country
What does it mean to drift

the drifting is not something special
and it doesn’t take long

But my not feeling the memory aside
latency which doesn’t mean anything

until a happier time found
