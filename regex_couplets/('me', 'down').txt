('me', 'down')

Where I sleep at times
in a sharp downward turn 

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
In a sharp downard turn

Then fall then summer from my face
It keeps coming down thankfully

Then fall then summer
to the down arrow

That’s where I sleep at times
the down arrow

in a moment of drifting away from the task
sudden downward turn

over the long time up in the sky
I brought my head down

Some disease effecting the tree out front
I brought my qualities down

The CEO tells me to embody values
which I brought down with qualities

In a continuous theme
I put my bread down

and the graph ahead of me
I brought my count down

a similar desire against me
I put my head down

emerging this year from standing water
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

And for an ungraspable time
One was up where it should be down

I could consume the dream
