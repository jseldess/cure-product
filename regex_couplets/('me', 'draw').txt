('me', 'draw')

Where I sleep at times
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

But my not feeling the memory aside
drawn formerly a long time

drawn formerly along 
I assumed what I draw

formerly along time they were on
drawn formerly rights blended themselves

dawn formerly nights ended themselves
drawn formerly rights

drawn formerly rights ended themselves
