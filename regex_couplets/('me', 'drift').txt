('me', 'drift')

Where I sleep at times
drifting away

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
drifting does not feel an exception

Then fall then summer
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
at any time it can drift again

Then I constellate my time family country
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

What does it mean to drift
the drifting is not something special

over the long time up in the sky
drifting away needs

Then I can’t presume to feed others
drifting away from the task

in a moment of drifting away from the task
