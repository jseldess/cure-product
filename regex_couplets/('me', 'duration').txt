('me', 'duration')

Where I sleep at times
for the duration of the answer

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
the duration of answers

But my not feeling the memory aside
for the duration of answers

for not paying sound overwhelmed
for the duration of the universe

firing and connecting somewhere
at least for the duration of the answer

joined me in wasting my vision
