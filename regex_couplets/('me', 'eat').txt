('me', 'eat')

Where I sleep at times
too sunny to eat ice cream

Then fall then summer from my face
I reach repeated expressions first

Then fall then summer
I propogated repeated expressions first

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
But I can’t let myself treat 

Then I can’t presume to need others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

at any time it can drift again
I let myself treat

Then I constellate my time family country
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

drifting away needs others presume desires
executive breath

over the long time up in the sky
execute breath

on the time line I was on
was not just a defeat

 and time in the train
Where I put it beating

The CEO tells me to embody values
of the habits I create

I had me a vision
of the habits they create.

since I can imagine movement
That company creates a life

with full potential to movement
it was not just a defeat

advancing the time
And from that great distance

I came back to me
And from a great distance

or in some imaginary elsewhere
for the creation of the universe

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
burrowed about from repeated travels

But my not feeling the memory aside
from cables reheated travels

firing and connecting somewhere
