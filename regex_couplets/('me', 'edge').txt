('me', 'edge')

Where I sleep at times
I step off the edge

I assumed it was visible
off the edge of the world

Then I constellate my time family country
Face falling off the edge of the face

Then fall then summer
value falling off the edge of the face

When I want something
The edge is put in place

wrestling me to stay still
I step over the edge

Which is a measure to never live out
Falling off the edge of the face

over the long time up in the sky
The value falling off the edge of the face

over the time line I was on
The value falling off the edge of th face

over the long time I was on
and testing the edge and gravity

I had me a vision
