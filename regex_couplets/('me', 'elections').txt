('me', 'elections')

Where I sleep at times
on my way to elections

I presume to others
formerly my way to the elections

shone formerly a long time
on a way to the elections

formerly along time they were on
formerly along my say to the elections

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
formally a way to the elections

By my memory elsewhere
My say to the elections

which I feel formerly about for
I stay the right of my elections

I have them trust in me
