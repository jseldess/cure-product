('me', 'else')

Where I sleep at times
If you have confidence regardless all else

 and time in the train
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I had me a vision
and elsewhere my memory

and elsewhere my memory of you
elsewhere my purposes

A way formerly like this one
elsewhere by my memory

washed by my memory
By my memory elsewhere

which I feel formerly about for
in memory elsewhere

in the long time they were on
but for memory elsewhere

in memory persisting elsewhere
