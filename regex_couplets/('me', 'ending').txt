('me', 'ending')

Where I sleep at times
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Then fall then summer from my face
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I had me a vision
talking into pheasants bending themselves

The long time I had a vision
talking into percents bending themselves

without the long time I was accounting
walking into percents blending themselves

If I take a different measure
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

But my not feeling the memory aside
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in memory elsewhere
