('me', 'enjoined')

Where I sleep at times
I was enjoined to act again myself

Then I canâ€™t presume to need others
I was enjoined to act again

Then fall then summer
I was enjoined to act

I had me a vision
I am enjoined to act again

since I can imagine movement
I was enjoined to act against

with full potential to movement
