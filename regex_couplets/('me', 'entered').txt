('me', 'entered')

Where I sleep at times
I have entered my phone

Then fall then summer from my face
I have entered my purposes

and elsewhere my memory of you
I have entered my purchases

But my not feeling the memory aside
entered into my purposes

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
I had entered my phone

By my memory elsewhere
