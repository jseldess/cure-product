('me', 'exactly')

Where I sleep at times
It’s not marshal exactly

But my not feeling the memory inside
It’s not marshall exactly

formerly a way like this one
I turn not sad exactly

By my memory elsewhere
I return not sad exactly

which I feel formerly about for
I returned not sad exactly

I have them trust in me
