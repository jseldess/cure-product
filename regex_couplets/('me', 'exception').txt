('me', 'exception')

Where I sleep at times
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

I assumed it was visible
does not feel an exception

Then fall then summer
drifting does not feel an exception

Which is a measure to never live out
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I constellate my time family country
For whom drifting is not an exception

What does it mean to drift
