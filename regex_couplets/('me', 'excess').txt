('me', 'excess')

Where I sleep at times
Did he carry one virtue to excess

So I constellate the time family country
if you have providence to excess

Then fall then summer
not one virtue to excess

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
to excess

 and time in the train
If articles can storm in excess

For an ungraspable time
