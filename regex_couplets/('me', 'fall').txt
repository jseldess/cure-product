('me', 'fall')

Where I sleep at times
Then fall then summer from my face

Then fall then summer
and not falling at all

When I want something
Face falling off the edge of the face

over the long time up in the sky
value falling off the edge of the face

Which is a measure to never live out
The value falling off the edge of the face

on the time line I was on
The value falling off the edge of th face

over the time line I was on
I see only the back of falling values

I had me a vision
falling off the encoded end

but would I love her the same
I take it out in the snow fall

Would I love the same
falling off the end

I resume unassimilable visions
falling off the end of the world

will not be the same
The first falling syllable

in the time
I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking

If I take a different measure
