('me', 'far')

Where I sleep at times
as far as I can see

Then fall then summer
as far back as my history heard

What was the last time
for to tire as far back as my history

The long time I had a vision
for as far back as my history

The long time I was a vision
in welfare and hope

which I feel formerly about for
