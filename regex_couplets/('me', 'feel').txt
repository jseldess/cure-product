('me', 'feel')

Where I sleep at times
conversations with our feelings

When I want something
conversation with our feelings

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
does not feel an exception

Then fall then summer
drifting does not feel an exception

Which is a measure to never live out
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I constellate my time family country
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I had me a vision
I tried to feel the extension of key values

since I can imagine movement
What would I feel without that goal

Would I love the same
But my not feeling the memory aside

and elsewhere my memory 
But my not feeling the memory inside

dawn formerly
which feels most comfortable

Where in me did I host
which feels more comfortable

latency which doesn’t mean anything
which is what feels most comfortable

Where in me did I lose
which I feel formerly about for

washed by my memory
By my feeling the memory inside

Formerly a way like this one
But my feeling the memory aside

firing and connecting somewhere
