('me', 'feeling')

Where I sleep at times
conversations with our feelings

When I want something
conversation with our feelings

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
But my not feeling the memory aside

and elsewhere my memory 
But my not feeling the memory inside

dawn formerly
By my feeling the memory inside

Formerly a way like this one
But my feeling the memory aside

firing and connecting somewhere
