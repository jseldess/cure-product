('me', 'field')

Where I sleep at times
Before we walk across the wide field

Then I constellate my time family country
stopped light with validated variegated fields

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone has walked across the field

only fragments of time with my children
stopped light with validated fields

By my memory elsewhere
