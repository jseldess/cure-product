('me', 'fill')

Where I sleep at times
in the form filled offered in trust

Elsewhere by my memory
in the form filled offered trust

washed by my memory
in the form filled offered must

Where in me pre-worn
in the form filled offered

Where did I lose trust in me
in the fill space 

I have them trust in me
