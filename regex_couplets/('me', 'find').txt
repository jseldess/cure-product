('me', 'find')

Where I sleep at times
So I find myself at home

brought messageable to you
I want to find a way to block it incoming

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
I can find a way to block it incoming

When I want something
I can find a way to block incoming 

only fragments of time with my children
with goals I find there

Then fall then summer
Companies increasingly find 

I had me a vision
I even know what I would find

will not be the same
