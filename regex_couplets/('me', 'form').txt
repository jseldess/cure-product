('me', 'form')

Where I sleep at times
There are performance reviews

Then I can’t presume to need others
Toward the start informally given my reasons

The long time I had a vision
already formerly a long time

I have a memory between the day
in the form filled offered in trust

Elsewhere by my memory
dawn already formerly nights 

formerly a long time they were on
A way formerly like this one

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
already formely a long time

Where in me did I last
dawn formerly

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
with dawn already formerly nights 

by my memory
in the form filled offered trust

washed by my memory
which I feel formerly about for

after though there’s no memory
in the form filled offered must

Where in me pre-worn
in the form filled offered

Where did I lose trust in me
formerly along time they were on

I presume to others
formerly a way

But my not feeling the memory inside
formerly a way like this one

The other end of means
formerly away

formerly my way 
shone formerly a long time

formerly my way to the elections
formally a way to the elections

formerly along my say to the elections
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
drawn formerly along 

time they were on
formerly a long time

I assumed what I draw
addition were filters formerly

in the long time they were on
shone formerly along time

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

dawn formerly rights blended themselves
drawn formerly rights blended themselves

dawn formerly nights ended themselves
drawn formerly rights

drawn formerly rights ended themselves
formerly along the time they were on

I have them trust in me
own best form

I can’t remember them
own best form to ourselves

home stays brought loyal
the people in home form

that agreed home to people
home rest form to ourselves 

I presume the offers
