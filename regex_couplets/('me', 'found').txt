('me', 'found')

Where I sleep at times
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

washed my memory
found dated for my own purchases

already formely a long time
and found inundated

But my not feeling the memory aside
and found redundant

already formerly a long time
and latency found

for not paying sound overwhelmed
until a happier time found

Where in me did I host
So I found myself at home

the prospects being seen by me
