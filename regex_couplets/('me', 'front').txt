('me', 'front')

Where I sleep at times
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

When I want something
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

Some disease effecting the tree out front
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Its strategy comes before morning goals
in front of the set afternoon

I had me a vision
in front of the set of regulations

since I can imagine movement
And need out in front purchase

For an ungraspable time
And read out in front

And for an ungraspable time
behind or out front or up above

I have them trust in me
