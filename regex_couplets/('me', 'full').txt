('me', 'full')

Where I sleep at times
It keeps coming down thankfully

Then fall then summer
I am full of potential

with full potential to movement
full of aspirations

since you can imagine movement
full of potential

I had me a vision
full of the missing words

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
still carefully

Where in me pre-worn
