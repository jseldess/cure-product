('me', 'get')

Where I sleep at times
I’ll get there eventually

Then I constellate my time family country
and is relentlessly budgeted

What does it mean to drift
I’ll get there ruins

Then fall then summer
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Its strategy comes before morning goals
I get through there

If I take a different measure
I get from here through there

If I take some different measure
in traversing get through there

I came after my past
get from here through there

I continue to presume
I get here through there

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
forgetting decisions 

I presume to others
forgettable

I assume the offers revisitable
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
and maybe forgettable

I assume the offers divisible
