('me', 'goals')

Where I sleep at times
Though there are quarters goals

wrestling me to stay still
We can wrestle them with their goals

Then fall then summer
and without quartely goals

Then I constellate my time family country
There are quarterly goals

Then I can’t presume to need others
before morning goals

Strategy comes before morning
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

Its strategy comes before morning goals
Strategy comes before goals

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
not goals

I had me a vision
