('me', 'going')

Where I sleep at times
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

I assumed it was visible
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

If I take a different measure
The way that she is going

A way formerly like this one
The way that I am going

But my not feeling the memory inside
The way that I was going

Formerly a way like this one
way I was going 

formerly a way
