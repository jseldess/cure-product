('me', 'grasp')

Where I sleep at times
having been graspable

I continue to presume
having been an ungraspable time

I continue to consume
Under the grasp principle

I came after my past
for an ungraspable purchase

For an ungraspable time
And for an ungraspable time

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
