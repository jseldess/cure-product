('me', 'gravity')

Where I sleep at times
and testing the edge and gravity

I had me a vision
where I need gravity

And for an ungraspable time
Where I lead gravity

or in some imaginary elsewhere
I tell you where I need gravity

I could consume the dream
that nothing had gravity

My means without gravity
so that nothing had gravity

without consumer damage
