('me', 'had')

Where I sleep at times
If he had not carried one virtue

Then fall then summer
When we had jobs that were to earn

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
when we had jobs that was to churn some bread

 and time in the train
I had me a vision

On the timeline I was on
Since I had to hold the entire company

since I can imagine movement
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

with full potential to movement
I had nightmares though

since you can imagine movement
I had to tell them the news

Would I love the same stuff
The long time I had a vision

without the long time I was accounting
I had a vision

I resume attributable visions
we had to say goodbye

For an ungraspable time
We had to say goodbye there

And for an ungraspable time
that nothing had gravity

My means without gravity
so that nothing had gravity

without consumer damage
we had inhabited actually

or alter of course the time anyway
in the space that it had

by my memory
in the face that I had

A way formerly like this one
though we are breaking in the space that it had

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
which had on honor to be told

for not paying sound overwhelmed
in the face that it had

Where in me did I lose
I had entered my phone

By my memory elsewhere
