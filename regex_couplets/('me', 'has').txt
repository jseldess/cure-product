('me', 'has')

Where I sleep at times
conversations with our purchase

Then fall then summer
Before anyone has walked across the opening

only fragments of time with my children
It has been since

Then I can’t presume to need others
in traversing my purchase

If I take some different measure
purchased out

I came after my past
having been purchased out

I came back to me
having been purchased out of you

For an ungraspable time
And need out in front purchase

And for an ungraspable time
I tell you the weight of my purchases

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
until I purchase up the sky

I could consume the dream
if that has anything

I have a memory between the day
I have entered my purchases

But my not feeling the memory aside
the impulse for my own purchases

and elsewhere my memory 
washed my purchases

A way formerly like this one
for my own purchases

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
found dated for my own purchases

already formely a long time
impulse for my own purchases

Elsewhere my memory
phase decisioned by the prospect

But my not feeling the memory inside
He has turned it off

Formerly a way like this one
phase decisioned

By my memory elsewhere
at the site of a purchase

I have them trust in me
which as tracked befitted phased

I presume the offers
converting sight into a purchase

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
