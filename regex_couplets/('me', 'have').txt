('me', 'have')

Where I sleep at times
We’ll have coffee this morning

I assumed it was visible
I have entered my phone

Then fall then summer from my face
before we can have a retroactive

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
as long as I have access to the code

only fragments of time with my children
if you have providence to excess

Then fall then summer
If you have confidence regardless all else

 and time in the train
May I have your zip code

Some disease effecting the tree out front
I have them lost

I have them trust in me
I have supporters

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I have a memory between the day

Or alter of course the time anyway
I have entered my purposes

and elsewhere my memory of you
I have entered my purchases

But my not feeling the memory aside
They have very many choices

A way formerly like this one
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

Where in me did I host
I have turned it off

Formerly a way like this one
and have no way

By my feeling the memory inside
I have seen more than I can remember

I presume to others
Or can have seen offering possession

I assumed that they were divisible
can have seen offering possession

I assume possession to others
You can have seen offering

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
