('me', 'he')

Where I sleep at times
But that is beside the point

I assumed it was visible
into the stream of pictures

into the minority proportion of time
The sun isn’t up 

So I presume the offers already
The prospects there already

brought messageable to you
by the private preambles

Then I constellate my time family country
Before we walk across the wide field

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i
When I woke up in the morning

Then fall then summer from my face
Before we walk across the wide opening

Then fall then summer
In the retroactive light

When I want something
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
All of the time

How can I appreciate the face in front of me
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

only fragments of time with my children
on a day there will be direction

wrestling me to stay still
I can’t fix them without direction

Which is a measure to never live out
others desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
In the right sense

What does it mean to drift
the drifting is not something special

over the long time up in the sky
I’ll get there eventually

at any time it can drift again
to the down arrow

That’s where I sleep at times
to the pillow

in a moment of drifting away from the task
The South Carolina primary 

So I constellate the time family country
I’ll pull myself another personality type

on the time line I was on
way high up in the internet

over the time line I was on
I am the first in the office

I constellate the time
When we had jobs that were to earn

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
when we had jobs that was to churn some bread

 and time in the train
Then I cannot see face value

Some disease effecting the tree out front
fish pulled out of the lake

The CEO tells me to embody values
Or the company

I spend time online learning to code
Spinning around the heart

In a continuous theme
I put my head down

and the graph ahead of me
with my head

a similar desire against me
not back in the results

emerging this year from standing water
from where I can claim

emerging this year from too much standing water
to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water

I had me a vision
there was no promotion

On the timeline I was on
The timeline

summer
The sun shielding from

Booked with a meeting
the dogs and lillies

over the long time I was on
until my purpose up in the sky

Strategy comes before morning
Then the sun isn’t up

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning
but the sun isn’t up

Strategy comes before goals
out in the snow

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
It’s the third letter from the end

since I can imagine movement
The days are long

with full potential to movement
that I was the arm of this

since you can imagine movement
across the retinas

Would I love the same stuff
falling off the encoded end

but would I love her the same
talking into pheasants bending themselves

The long time I had a vision
without the long time I was accounting

Would I love the same
there was no walking along the pleasure

promoting from home to a new job
there was no walking along

promoting from home
where you can earn more 

from home
walking along the measure

walking from home along the measure
there wasn’t any television 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
Where I take my liesure

I resume unassimilable visions
I take it out in the snow fall

If I take a different measure
as far back as my history heard

What was the last time
I can hear them between bills and stuff

will not be the same
The first track

in the time
actually considering the end

If I take some different measure
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

explicit statements
up in the television pleasure

I resume indelible tracks
though not many facts up in the sky

wrapped in static and explicit statements
up in the television

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
but I can hear them

I resume attributable visions
You can hear it also through static leisure

I need an explicit statement
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

advancing the time
Toward the start informally given my reasons

The long time I was a vision
until I purpose the horizon

which is the long time I was on
talking into percents bending themselves

without the long time I was on accounting
without accounting the long time I was on

which is all the time
the long time I was on

in the long time they were on
I have them lost

I have them trust in me
in pursuit of the sight

that will spur me on
I get through there

that will try me on 
even when close to my owning

I came back to me
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

I came after my past
under the last seen principle

I continue to presume
I get from here through there

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses

having been an ungraspable time
Then I continue to dream then

I could consume the dream
Under the grass principle

I continue to consume 
Then I continued to dream then

For an ungraspable time
under the grasp principle

And for an ungraspable time
they can be waived

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
While we’re up in the sky 

I let it remind me again
Where I lead gravity

without consumer damage
I continued to dream then

My means without gravity
without any further damage

to any consumer damage
until the bill came

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

or alter of course the time anyway
Though we are waiting for her

already formerly a long time
to the ends of my transactions

I have a memory between the day
And we could inhabit the room easy

Where in me did I host
in the form filled offered in trust

Elsewhere by my memory
washed by my memory

by my memory
formerly a long time they were on

and elsewhere my memory
and other types of tracking technology

and elsewhere my memory of you
Then I saw into you

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

Elsewhere my memory
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

washed my memory
people would be helped

A way formerly like this one
The constituents would be helped

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
where I send and relive would be held

already formely a long time
where I send and relive aside

Where in me did I last
Where I stand and relive

But my not feeling the memory inside
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

dawn formerly
where I am aside at least

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I send and retrieve relive

firing and connecting somewhere
where I send and receive

for not paying sound overwhelmed
the resemblance

and move them literally with me
I literally move them

without their agreement
if there is anything 

latency which doesn’t mean anything
The floor slanted in places

I assumed 
I speak to them my possessions

dawn already formerly nights 
I speak them of my possessions

I presume to others
speak them of my possessions

pre-worn in me
in the space that it had

and that man comes on to tell me 
– The Rolling Stones

Where in me did I lose
about the site

Where in me did I loose
in the form filled offered trust

where in me pre-worn
pre-worn and still wash them

By my memory elsewhere
washed I answered about

after though there’s no memory
so still washed

Where in me did I lose trust
in the form filled offered

Where did I lose trust in me
Where did we lose trust

formerly along time they were on
stopping into the prospect

Formerly a way like this one
to the other end

formerly a way
to the other end of actions

The other end of means
The way that I was going

Formerly away there are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

By my feeling the memory inside
There are constant ways

To the other end of means like this one
Like this one the other end of means

formerly away
with constant ways to the other end

formerly my way 
formerly my way to the elections

shone formerly a long time
on a way to the elections

formerly along my say to the elections
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
time they were on

formerly a long time
formally a way to the elections

which I feel formerly about for
where I send and relive

But my feeling the memory aside
where I am aside increased

joined me in wasting my vision
battery dawn nights blending themselves

in memory elsewhere
shone from the housing

but for memory elsewhere
in memory persisting elsewhere

addition were filters formerly
battery dawn nights ending themselves

but standing in memory
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

drawn formerly rights blended themselves
dawn formerly nights ended themselves

drawn formerly rights
ended themselves

drawn formerly rights ended themselves
where rights ended themselves

drawn formerly along 
formerly along the time they were on

I can’t remember them
that their knowing

that agreed home
phrase them

I assume the offers reliable
I assume the offers revisitable

I assume the offers divisible
that they were visible

and came home to rewind inflections
stopping in the middle

at home brought into privacy
buy in the sound privacy

home stays brought loyal
the people in home form

that agreed home to people
that agreed to one the people

home rest form to ourselves 
the people in own form

I presume the offers
between the private ambles

So I find myself at home
if only on the way to the trash

being seen by me
the prospects being seen by me

at home brought into private
The prospect of seeing healthily 

So I resume the offers already
So I presume the offers

So I presume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home
presume the offers at 

in privacy that is messageable
traffick is there nonetheless

in that I cannot remember 
that they were divisible

and came home to rewind
before I act on them

Having seen more than I can remember 
The sun high enough to strike directly

I assumed that they were divisible
stepping off into the middle

and come home to remind inflections
stepping off in to the middle

I assume possession to others
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
