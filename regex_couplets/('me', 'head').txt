('me', 'head')

Where I sleep at times
Without a head

Then I constellate my time family country
I brought my head down

Then fall then summer
I search with my head

In a continuous theme
I put my head down

and the graph ahead of me
with my head

a similar desire against me
I log in and search with my head

emerging this year from standing water
into the next level head

I had me a vision
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

Where in me did I host
