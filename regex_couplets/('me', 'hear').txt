('me', 'hear')

Where I sleep at times
You can hear it also through your leisure

Which is a measure to never live out
and my heart rate

Then fall then summer
and my heartrate

The CEO tells me to embody values
Spinning around the heart

In a continuous theme
I hear it between bills and stuff

On the timeline I was on
I can hear it between bills and stuff

Would I love the same stuff
that I can hear

I resume unassimilable visions
as far back as my history heard

What was the last time
I can hear them between bills and stuff

will not be the same
that I hear without trying

in the time
but I can hear them

If I take a different measure
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

I resume attributable visions
You can hear it also through static leisure

If I take some different measure
In my heart did I lose trust

Where did I lose trust in me
