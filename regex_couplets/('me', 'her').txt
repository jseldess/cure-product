('me', 'her')

Where I sleep at times
Whereas direction is beside the point

I assumed it was visible
The prospects there already

brought messageable to you
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Then I constellate my time family country
I told her a story, she drew waves.

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
Of course there is a direction

When I want something
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

All of the time
One day there is direction

Then fall then summer
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

only fragments of time with my children
on a day there will be direction

wrestling me to stay still
there are quarters 

Which is a measure to never live out
others desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
I’ll get there eventually

at any time it can drift again
That’s where I sleep at times

in a moment of drifting away from the task
Others desires as legitimate

over the long time up in the sky
I’ll pull my data higher up

on the time line I was on
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

So I constellate the time family country
here described

I constellate the time
To neither study

 and time in the train
Where official policy is to catch and release

Some disease effecting the tree out front
Where I put it beating

The CEO tells me to embody values
higher up in the results

emerging this year from standing water
from where I can claim

emerging this year from too much standing water
there was no promotion

On the timeline I was on
I’ll pull myself higher up

summer
higher up in the internet

over the time line I was on
There was very little physical activity

Since I can imagine movement
that potential is there for you

with full potential to movement
but would I love her the same

If I take a different measure
Where I take my liesure

I had me a vision
there was no walking along the pleasure

promoting from home to a new job
there was no walking along

promoting from home
where you can earn more 

from home
there wasn’t any television 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
On the other hand

explicit statements
there was no television to hear

I resume attributable visions
but where is it

The long time I had a vision
I get through there

If I take some different measure
I get from here through there

I came back to me
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

I came after my past
in traversing get through there

I continue to presume
I get here through there

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

having been an ungraspable time
And we had to say goodbye to her there

For an ungraspable time
We had to say goodbye there

And for an ungraspable time
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I could consume the dream
Where I lead gravity

without consumer damage
without any further damage

to any consumer damage
here is the site of the battle of maldon

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
Though we are waiting for her

already formerly a long time
Where in me did I host

Elsewhere by my memory
if there is anything 

I have a memory between the day
Where I host my purposes

and elsewhere my memory
and other types of tracking technology

and elsewhere my memory of you
where I send and relive aside

Elsewhere my memory
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

washed my memory
elsewhere my purposes

A way formerly like this one
where I send and relive would be held

already formely a long time
where I stand and relive

Where in me did I last
where I end

But my not feeling the memory inside
where I send and relive

But my not feeling the memory aside
where I send and retrieve aside

dawn formerly
where I am aside at least

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I send and retrieve relive

firing and connecting somewhere
where I send and receive

for not paying sound overwhelmed
I presume to others

washed by my memory
Where in me did I lose

pre-worn in me
Where in me did I loose

by my memory 
where in me pre-worn

By my memory elsewhere
after though there’s no memory

Where in me did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

I assumed 
with her waves

Formerly a way like this one
to the other end

formerly a way
to the other end of actions

The other end of means
Formerly away there are constant ways

By my feeling the memory inside
There are constant ways

To the other end of means like this one
Like this one the other end of means

formerly away
with constant ways to the other end

formerly my way 
where rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
where I stand aside

But my feeling the memory aside
where I am aside increased

joined me in wasting my vision
in memory elsewhere

in the long time they were on
but for memory elsewhere

in memory persisting elsewhere
where lights blended themselves

drawn formerly along 
Cereal and others’ health

which I feel formerly about for
I learned the point where I am

I have them trust in me
where the tongue rippled

I can’t remember them
The offers there already

The prospects being seen by me
traffick is there nonetheless

I presume the offers
I assume possession to others

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
