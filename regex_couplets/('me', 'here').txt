('me', 'here')

Where I sleep at times
Whereas direction is beside the point

I assumed it was visible
The prospects there already

brought messageable to you
I’ll get there eventually

Then I constellate my time family country
Of course there is a direction

When I want something
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

All of the time
One day there is direction

Then fall then summer
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

only fragments of time with my children
on a day there will be direction

wrestling me to stay still
there are quarters 

Which is a measure to never live out
There are quarterly goals

Then I can’t presume to need others
That’s where I sleep at times

in a moment of drifting away from the task
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

So I constellate the time family country
here described

I constellate the time
Where official policy is to catch and release

Some disease effecting the tree out front
Where I put it beating

The CEO tells me to embody values
I’ll get there ruins

emerging this year from standing water
from where I can claim

emerging this year from too much standing water
there was no promotion

On the timeline I was on
There was very little physical activity

Since I can imagine movement
that potential is there for you

with full potential to movement
Where I take my liesure

I had me a vision
there was no walking along the pleasure

promoting from home to a new job
there was no walking along

promoting from home
where you can earn more 

from home
there wasn’t any television 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
there was no television to hear

I resume attributable visions
but where is it

The long time I had a vision
I get through there

If I take a different measure
I get from here through there

If I take some different measure
in traversing get through there

I came after my past
get from here through there

I continue to presume
I get here through there

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
here is the site of the battle of maldon

having been an ungraspable time
And we had to say goodbye to her there

For an ungraspable time
We had to say goodbye there

And for an ungraspable time
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I came back to me
Where I lead gravity

I could consume the dream
Where in me did I host

Elsewhere by my memory
if there is anything 

I have a memory between the day
Where I host my purposes

and elsewhere my memory
and elsewhere my memory of you

But my not feeling the memory aside
where I send and relive aside

Elsewhere my memory
elsewhere my purposes

A way formerly like this one
where I send and relive would be held

already formely a long time
where I stand and relive

Where in me did I last
where I end

washed my memory
where I send and relive

But my not feeling the memory inside
where I send and retrieve aside

dawn formerly
where I am aside at least

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I send and retrieve relive

firing and connecting somewhere
where I send and receive

for not paying sound overwhelmed
Where in me did I lose

washed by my memory
Where in me did I loose

by my memory 
where in me pre-worn

By my memory elsewhere
after though there’s no memory

Where in me did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

already formerly a long time
Is there a baby and a bear

Formerly a way like this one
There are constant ways

The other end of means
Formerly away there are constant ways

By my feeling the memory inside
where rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
where I stand aside

But my feeling the memory aside
where I am aside increased

joined me in wasting my vision
in memory elsewhere

in the long time they were on
but for memory elsewhere

in memory persisting elsewhere
where lights blended themselves

drawn formerly along 
my ethereal economic relations

which I feel formerly about for
I learned the point where I am

I have them trust in me
where the tongue rippled

I can’t remember them
The offers there already

The prospects being seen by me
traffick is there nonetheless

I presume the offers
