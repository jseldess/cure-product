('me', 'high')

Where I sleep at times
way high up in the inter

over the long time up in the sky
I’ll pull my data higher up

on the time line I was on
way high up in the internet

over the time line I was on
higher up in the results

Then fall then summer
high in the content architecture

emerging this year from standing water
high up in the internet

I had me a vision
I’ll pull myself higher up

summer
higher up in the internet

over the long time I was on
your bid to the next highest ranked network

since I can imagine movement
The sun high enough to enter directly 

advancing the time
The sun high enough to strike directly

I assumed that they were divisible
