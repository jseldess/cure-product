('me', 'hold')

Where I sleep at times
I take hold of my finger

Then fall then summer
When they really take hold of my finger

In a continuous theme
hold at intervals riding forward

a similar desire against me
Since I had to hold the entire company

I had me a vision
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

Since I can imagine movement
and hold and wish to hold

If I take a different measure
designed to hold up my underwear

And for an ungraspable time
