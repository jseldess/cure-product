('me', 'impulse')

Where I sleep at times
impulse control

In a continuous theme
I send and retrieve the impulse

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

and elsewhere my memory 
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

already formely a long time
the impulse my own prospects

Elsewhere my memory
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

But my not feeling the memory inside
the impulse for my own prospects

dawn formerly
impulse for my own purchases

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
