('me', 'ink')

Where I sleep at times
ink

Then I can’t presume to need others
all that I can think I want

I resume unassimilable visions
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

If I take a different measure
I only think I don’t listen

in privacy that is messageable
For a while I think I don’t listen

All that I own messageable
