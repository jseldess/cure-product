interjecting on a day ambition

Then fall then summer
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

only fragments of time with my children
interjecting into the stream

wrestling me to stay still

In a continuous theme

The long time I had a vision
my interfaced stand data

By my memory elsewhere
Aligned or not with my interests

which I feel formerly about for
I interfaced

but for memory elsewhere
 as points which are my interest 

I have them trust in me
