('me', 'isn\xe2\x80\x99t')

Where I sleep at times
The sun isn’t up 

I assumed it was visible
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

into the minority proportion of time
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
The edge isn’t even there

wrestling me to stay still
Then the sun isn’t available

over the time line I was on
Then the sun isn’t up 

So I constellate the time family country
but the sun isn’t up

Strategy comes before goals
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

I had me a vision
