('me', 'joined')

Where I sleep at times
I was enjoined to act again myself

Then I can’t presume to need others
I was enjoined to act again

Then fall then summer
I was enjoined to act

I had me a vision
I am enjoined to act again

since I can imagine movement
I was enjoined to act against

with full potential to movement
joined in my television

joined me in wasting my vision
my daughter’s squirrel and chickadee joined me

By my memory elsewhere
