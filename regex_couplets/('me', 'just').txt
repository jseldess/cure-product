('me', 'just')

Where I sleep at times
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

When I want something
They’re just not mine

wrestling me to stay still
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Then I can’t presume to need others
was not just a defeat

 and time in the train
I just got a letter

I had me a vision
it was not just a defeat

advancing the time
