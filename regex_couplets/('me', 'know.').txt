('me', 'know.')

Where I sleep at times
who knows the way

Then fall then summer from my face
how can I know without direction

wrestling me to stay still
Though how can you know without direction

Then fall then summer
I even know what I would find

will not be the same
even when close to my knowing

If I take some different measure
When closed to my knowing

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
knowing the constituents

for not paying sound overwhelmed
who knows how to turn it off

But my not feeling the memory inside
who know the ways to their other end

By my feeling the memory inside
that their knowing

I have them trust in me
