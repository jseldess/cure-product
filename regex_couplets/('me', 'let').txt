('me', 'let')

Where I sleep at times
But I can’t let myself treat 

Then I can’t presume to need others
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
I let myself treat

Then I constellate my time family country
But I can’t let myself disregard

over the long time up in the sky
It’s the third letter from the end

I had me a vision
I let it remind me again

And for an ungraspable time
