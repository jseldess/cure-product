('me', 'light')

Where I sleep at times
variegated reflected light

Then I constellate my time family country
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Then fall then summer from my face
In the retroactive light

Then fall then summer
In the light of retroactive conversations

When I want something
in light of learning what we see

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
stopped light with validated fields

By my memory elsewhere
where lights blended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
stopped light with validated faces

which I feel formerly about for
