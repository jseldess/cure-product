('me', 'line')

Where I sleep at times
on the time line I was on

over the long time up in the sky
over the time line I was on

So I constellate the time family country
I spend time online learning to code

Then fall then summer
On the timeline I was on

The timeline
over the long line up in the sky

over the long time I was on
barely outlines

Strategy comes before morning
The days lined along company

with full potential to movement
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

A way formerly like this one
Choose a line

I canâ€™t remember them
