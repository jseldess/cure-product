('me', 'literal')

Where I sleep at times
and literally moved

I have a memory between the day
as it was designed literally

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
and literally unproved

already formely a long time
literally unproved 

already formerly a long time
myself moved literally as it is

Where in me did I host
I literally moved

and move them literally with me
I literally move them

without their agreement
literally move

latency which doesn’t mean anything
and literally moved about

I assumed 
and it’s not literal

and that man comes on to tell me 
literally moved

Elsewhere by my memory
what literally moved

Where in me did I lose
not literally moved about

washed by my memory
not literally moved

which I feel formerly about for
