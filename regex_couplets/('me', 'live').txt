('me', 'live')

Where I sleep at times
I am to end my connections suspended live

I assumed it was visible
I upend live connections to you

into the minority proportion of time
Which is a measure to never live out

and canâ€™t presume to need
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

So I constellate the time family country
Which is a pleasure to never live out

Then fall then summer
where I send and relive aside

and elsewhere my memory 
where I send and relive would be held

already formely a long time
where I stand and relive

Where in me did I last
where I send and relive

But my not feeling the memory inside
where I stand and retrieve relive

dawn formerly
where I send and retrieve relive

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
and relive from burrowed travels

But my not feeling the memory aside
where I end and relive

firing and connecting somewhere
where I blend and relive

for not paying sound overwhelmed
where I stand and retrieve and relive

But my feeling the memory aside
