('me', 'log')

Where I sleep at times
I logged in

Then fall then summer
I log in and search with my head

In a continuous theme
I used my technology

And for an ungraspable time
and other types of tracking technology

and elsewhere my memory of you
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

washed my memory
