('me', 'lose')

Where I sleep at times
even when close to my owning

If I take some different measure
even when close to my knowing

I came back to me
even when closed

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
Where in me did I lose

Elsewhere by my memory
Where in me did I lose trust

Where did I lose trust in me
Where did we lose trust

already formerly a long time
