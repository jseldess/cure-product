('me', 'low')

Where I sleep at times
slow

Itâ€™s time to wake up, Papa!
slow asynchronous

Then fall then summer
to the pillow

in a moment of drifting away from the task
low in the content architecture

The CEO tells me to embody values
Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture

emerging this year from standing water
I am not allowed to see their face

I had me a vision
under pillowing a cloud

without the long time I was on accounting
