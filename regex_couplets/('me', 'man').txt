('me', 'man')

Where I sleep at times
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

I assumed it was visible
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Then fall then summer
To my children Walt Whitman

Which is a measure to never live out
Walt Whitman

What does it mean to drift
Walt Whitman drifted

over the long time up in the sky
There are performance reviews

Then I canâ€™t presume to need others
not many face up

explicit statements
though not many facts up in the sky

I resume unassimilable visions
in not many tracks up in the sky

I resume attributable visions
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
They have very many choices

A way formerly like this one
and that man comes on to tell me 

I had me a vision
The many transparent pixel calls

But my not feeling the memory inside
