('me', 'middle')

Where I sleep at times
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

So I constellate the time family country
stopping in the middle

So I presume the offers already
stepping in the middle

So I resume the offers already
stepping off into the middle

I presume the offers
stepping off in to the middle

I assume possession to others
