('me', 'morning')

Where I sleep at times
We’ll have coffee this morning

I assumed it was visible
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

into the minority proportion of time
When I woke up in the morning

Then fall then summer from my face
before morning goals

Strategy comes before morning
after having been contented Strategy comes before morning

Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
It’s morning 

Its strategy comes before morning goals
