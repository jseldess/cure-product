('me', 'myself')

Where I sleep at times
So I find myself at home

brought messageable to you
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Then I constellate my time family country
But I can’t let myself treat 

Then I can’t presume to need others
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
I let myself treat

What does it mean to drift
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

over the long time up in the sky
I was enjoined to act again myself

Then I can’t presume to feed others
But I can’t let myself disregard

Then fall then summer
And make myself a visible

on the time line I was on
I keep turning back again myself

Some disease effecting the tree out front
I’ll pull myself higher up

summer
off the end myself

I had me a vision
I was bid to act again myself

since I can imagine movement
I was enjoying acting against myself

with full potential to movement
myself

Where in me did I host
the least productive of myself

But my not feeling the memory aside
the least instructive of myself

joined me in wasting my vision
So I found myself at home

the prospects being seen by me
