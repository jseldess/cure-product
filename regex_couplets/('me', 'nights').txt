('me', 'nights')

Where I sleep at times
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Then fall then summer from my face
dawn already formerly nights 

formerly a long time they were on
with dawn already formerly nights 

by my memory
battery dawn nights 

But my not feeling the memory inside
nights

formerly a way
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

By my feeling the memory inside
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in memory elsewhere
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

dawn formerly rights blended themselves
dawn formerly nights ended themselves

drawn formerly rights blended themselves
