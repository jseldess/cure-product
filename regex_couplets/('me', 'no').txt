('me', 'no')

Where I sleep at times
into the minority proportion of time

I assumed it was visible
Then I cannot see face value

Then I constellate my time family country
asynchronous 

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
on a snow day with my children

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
not calling or echoing for once

Then fall then summer from my face
and not falling at all

Then fall then summer
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

All of the time
if not directly on my skin

When I want something
of not directly from my skin

only fragments of time with my children
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

wrestling me to stay still
Though how can you know without direction

Which is a measure to never live out
But not to impart cynicism

What does it mean to drift
the drifting is not something special

over the long time up in the sky
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Then I can’t presume to need others
I’ll pull myself another personality type

So I constellate the time family country
Right now I’m the cart

on the time line I was on
by no ventillation my purpose

over the time line I was on
I am told by no ventillation

I constellate the time
not one virtue to excess

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
for not voting for him

when we had jobs that was to churn some bread
Which can be pronounced to the world

 and time in the train
In a vertiginous dream

Some disease effecting the tree out front
in a continuous vertiginous dream

The CEO tells me to embody values
But not to me directly

I spend time online learning to code
not back in the results

In a continuous theme
there was no promotion

On the timeline I was on
over the long line I would honor

over the long time I was on
out in the snow

Strategy comes before morning
upsent in the afternoon

I had me a vision
in front of the set afternoon

since I can imagine movement
I take it out in the snow fall

Would I love the same
there was no walking along the pleasure

promoting from home to a new job
there was no walking along

promoting from home
no solid ground to continue along

from home
may not be ingrained

I resume unassimilable visions
may not be engrained

will not be the same
will no be ingrainded 

in the time
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

If I take a different measure
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

What was the last time
not many face up

explicit statements
though not many facts up in the sky

If I take some different measure
until I could not tire 

I resume indelible tracks
I cannot clear it also through investiture

wrapped in static implicit statements
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I resume attributable visions
until I could not be tired

I need an explicit statement
The sun high enough to enter directly 

advancing the time
until I could not be hired

without the long time I was accounting
even when close to my knowing

I came back to me
When closed to my knowing

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

I came after my past
I used my technology

And for an ungraspable time
that nothing had gravity

My means without gravity
so that nothing had gravity

without consumer damage
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
and other types of tracking technology

and elsewhere my memory of you
which we can pronounce

But my not feeling the memory aside
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

washed my memory
not speaking

A way formerly like this one
But my not feeling the memory inside

dawn formerly
not needing to wait

firing and connecting somewhere
knowing the constituents

for not paying sound overwhelmed
ground for not paying

latency which doesn’t mean anything
useless for not having paid

Where in me did I host
and it’s not literal

already formerly a long time
who knows the way

By my memory elsewhere
not literally moved about

washed by my memory
after though there’s no memory

Where in me did I loose
It’s not marshal exactly

Formerly a way like this one
It’s not marshall exactly

The other end of means
with no constant way

By my feeling the memory inside
I end up in Bach with no way 

formerly my way 
from no one point

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
But my not 

joined me in wasting my vision
Aligned or not with my interests

which I feel formerly about for
I turn not sad exactly

in memory elsewhere
between cereal and economic

I have them trust in me
that their knowing

I can’t remember them
in that I cannot remember 

I assume the offers revisitable
which is not necessarily possible

So I presume the offers already
for a while not to listen

presume the offers at 
traffick is there nonetheless

I presume the offers
The sun high enough to strike directly

I assumed that they were divisible
