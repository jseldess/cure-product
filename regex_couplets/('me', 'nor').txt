('me', 'nor')

Where I sleep at times
into the minority proportion of time

I assumed it was visible
over the long line I would honor

over the time line I was on
nor work in this way daily

 and time in the train
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I resume attributable visions
nor envy honest work

and elsewhere my memory of you
which had on honor to be told

for not paying sound overwhelmed
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

But my not feeling the memory inside
