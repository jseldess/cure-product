('me', 'now')

Where I sleep at times
On a snow day with my children

Then I constellate my time family country
who knows the way

Then fall then summer from my face
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

wrestling me to stay still
Though how can you know without direction

Then fall then summer
Right now I’m the cart

over the long time up in the sky
out in the snow

over the time line I was on
out in the snow fall

I had me a vision
I take it out in the snow fall

Would I love the same
I even know what I would find

will not be the same
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

I resume unassimilable visions
even when close to my knowing

If I take some different measure
When closed to my knowing

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
knowing the constituents

for not paying sound overwhelmed
who knows how to turn it off

But my not feeling the memory inside
who know the ways to their other end

By my feeling the memory inside
that their knowing

I have them trust in me
