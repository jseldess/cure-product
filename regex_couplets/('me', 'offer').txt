('me', 'offer')

Where I sleep at times
So I presume the offers already

at home brought into privacy
in the form filled offered in trust

Elsewhere by my memory
in the form filled offered trust

washed by my memory
in the form filled offered must

Where in me pre-worn
in the form filled offered

Where did I lose trust in me
in track as offer asked 

A way formerly like this one
I assume the offers reliable

in that I cannot remember 
I assume the offers revisitable

I assume the offers divisible
I presume the offers

brought messageable to you
The offers there already

The prospects being seen by me
So I resume the offers already

at home visions can be attainable
I offer to you

So I presume the offers
So I presume the offers at home already

brought messageable into privacy
I resume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home
presume the offers at 

in privacy that is messageable
Or can have seen offering possession

I presume to others
and can see offering

I assumed that they were divisible
seen having or offering possession

I assume possession to others
in school and can see offering

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
can have seen offering possession
