('me', 'only')

Where I sleep at times
only fragments of time with my children

Then fall then summer
only in the case

 and time in the train
So that I notice I am the only one

Strategy comes before morning
I see only the back of falling values

I had me a vision
would only willingly break

for not paying sound overwhelmed
if only on the way to the trash

being seen by me
I only think I donâ€™t listen

in privacy that is messageable
less only money

I presume the offers
