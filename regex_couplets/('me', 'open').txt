('me', 'open')

Where I sleep at times
Before we walk across the wide opening

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Then fall then summer
Before anyone buys up the opening

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

only fragments of time with my children
my desires were open

The CEO tells me to embody values
I wish my desires were open

and the graph ahead of me
The simple act opening surmounted

I resume attributable visions
