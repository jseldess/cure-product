('me', 'other')

Where I sleep at times
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Then I constellate my time family country
others desires

Then fall then summer
Then I can’t presume to need others

drifting away needs others presume desires
If I let myself see others desires

Then I can’t presume to feed others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

at any time it can drift again
On the other hand

explicit statements
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

I came after my past
and other types of tracking technology

and elsewhere my memory of you
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

washed my memory
I presume to others

Where in me did I host
to the other end

But my not feeling the memory inside
the other end transactions

formerly a way
to the other end of actions

Formerly a way like this one
The other end of means

Formerly away there are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

By my feeling the memory inside
the other end of actions

To the other end of means like this one
Like this one the other end of means

formerly away
with constant ways to the other end

formerly my way 
Cereal and others’ health

which I feel formerly about for
I assume possession to others

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
