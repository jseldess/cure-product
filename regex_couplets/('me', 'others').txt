('me', 'others')

Where I sleep at times
others desires

Then fall then summer
Then I can’t presume to need others

drifting away needs others presume desires
If I let myself see others desires

Then I can’t presume to feed others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

at any time it can drift again
I presume to others

Where in me did I host
Cereal and others’ health

which I feel formerly about for
I assume possession to others

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
