('me', 'our')

Where I sleep at times
reasons resources

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
conversations with our purchase

Then fall then summer
conversations with our reactions

When I want something
conversation with our feelings

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Of course there is a direction

only fragments of time with my children
You can hear it also through your leisure

Which is a measure to never live out
bring your child along

What does it mean to drift
Two hours and

 and time in the train
May I have your zip code

Some disease effecting the tree out front
or an available resource

summer
with four key value pairs

I had me a vision
or alter of course the time anyway

already formerly a long time
This is your voice 

and elsewhere my memory of you
This is your chance

But my not feeling the memory aside
Who throws contours away

Formerly a way like this one
who throws contours a way

The other end of means
The contours exchange with you

But my not feeling the memory inside
phrase them of our possessions

I can’t remember them
own best form to ourselves

home stays brought loyal
ensure to ourselves

the people in home form
and our 

that agreed home to people
home rest form to ourselves 

I presume the offers
