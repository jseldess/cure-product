('me', 'over')

Where I sleep at times
I step over the edge

Then fall then summer
over the long time up in the sky

Then I constellate my time family country
over the time line I was on

So I constellate the time family country
hovering above standing water

emerging this year from standing water
over the long line up in the sky

over the long time I was on
oddly grown over with historic bark

I had me a vision
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

advancing the time
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

I came after my past
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

washed my memory
for not paying sound overwhelmed

latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

I assumed that they were divisible
