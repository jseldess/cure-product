('me', 'point')

Where I sleep at times
But that is beside the point

I assumed it was visible
Whereas direction is beside the point

into the minority proportion of time
from no one point

dawn formerly
the point where I am

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
I am requesting my point

But my not feeling the memory aside
 as points which are my interest 

which I feel formerly about for
I learned my point

I have them trust in me
