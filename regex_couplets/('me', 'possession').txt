('me', 'possession')

Where I sleep at times
I speak to them my possessions

and move them literally with me
my possessions

latency which doesn’t mean anything
my possession of my children

I presume to others
speak them of my possessions

Where in me did I host
I speak them of my possessions

A way formerly like this one
speech my possession of my children

By my memory elsewhere
I stay the right of my possessions 

which I feel formerly about for
To the right of interned possessions

I have them trust in me
possessions people

in the long time they were on
phrase them of our possessions

I can’t remember them
possessions

that agreed home
phrase them of my possessions

I presume the offers
Or can have seen offering possession

I assumed that they were divisible
seen having or offering possession

I assume possession to others
can have seen offering possession

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
