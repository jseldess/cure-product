('me', 'presume')

Where I sleep at times
So I presume the offers already

at home brought into privacy
and can’t presume to need

Then I can’t presume to need others
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to feed others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

at any time it can drift again
I continue to presume

If I take a different measure
I presume to others

Where in me did I host
I presume the offers

brought messageable to you
So I presume the offers

So I presume the offers at home already
presume the offers at 

in privacy that is messageable
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

I assume the offers reliable
