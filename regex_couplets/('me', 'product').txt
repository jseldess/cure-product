('me', 'product')

Where I sleep at times
an impure product

Itâ€™s time to wake up, Papa!
What is an impure product

Then fall then summer from my face
as a cure product

Then fall then summer
as a pure product

Which is a measure to never live out
as an impure product

drifting away needs others presume desires
the least productive of myself

But my not feeling the memory aside
