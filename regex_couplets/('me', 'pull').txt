('me', 'pull')

Where I sleep at times
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Then I constellate my time family country
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

over the long time up in the sky
I’ll pull my data higher up

on the time line I was on
fish pulled out of the lake

The CEO tells me to embody values
I’ll pull myself higher up

summer
I’ll pull my data

over the time line I was on
