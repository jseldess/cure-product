('me', 'pulse')

Where I sleep at times
impulse control

In a continuous theme
I send and retrieve the impulse

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

and elsewhere my memory 
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

already formely a long time
the impulse my own prospects

Elsewhere my memory
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

But my not feeling the memory inside
the impulse for my own prospects

dawn formerly
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

Formerly a way like this one
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

formerly a way
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

The other end of means
impulse for my own purchases

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
