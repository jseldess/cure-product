('me', 'purchases')

Where I sleep at times
I tell you the weight of my purchases

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
Is the weight of my purchases

And for an ungraspable time
I have entered my purchases

But my not feeling the memory aside
the impulse for my own purchases

and elsewhere my memory 
washed my purchases

A way formerly like this one
for my own purchases

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
found dated for my own purchases

already formely a long time
impulse for my own purchases

Elsewhere my memory
