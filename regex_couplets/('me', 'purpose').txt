('me', 'purpose')

Where I sleep at times
by no ventillation my purpose

over the time line I was on
until my purpose up in the sky

over the long time up in the sky
until I purpose the horizon

I resume attributable visions
of my purpose in versing

If I take some different measure
of my purpose in conversing

which is all the time
in traversing my purpose

If I take a different measure
in conversing of my purpose

that will spur me on
in pursuing my purpose

I came back to me
My purpose up in the sky

For an ungraspable time
Until my purpose 

And for an ungraspable time
until I purpose up in the sky

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I tell you my purposes

I could consume the dream
I tell you the weight of my purposes

without consumer damage
Where I host my purposes

and elsewhere my memory
I have entered my purposes

and elsewhere my memory of you
the impulse for my own purposes

Elsewhere my memory
entered into my purposes

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
elsewhere my purposes

A way formerly like this one
the impulse to my purpose

dawn formerly
to the other end of my purpose

But my not feeling the memory inside
aside the impulse to my purpose

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
for my own purposes

which I feel formerly about for
