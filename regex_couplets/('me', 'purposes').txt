('me', 'purposes')

Where I sleep at times
I tell you my purposes

And for an ungraspable time
I tell you the weight of my purposes

I could consume the dream
Where I host my purposes

and elsewhere my memory
I have entered my purposes

and elsewhere my memory of you
the impulse for my own purposes

Elsewhere my memory
entered into my purposes

elsewhere my purposes

A way formerly like this one
for my own purposes

which I feel formerly about for
