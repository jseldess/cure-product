('me', 'really')

Where I sleep at times
because it was really dark

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
it was really sunny

Then fall then summer from my face
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

All of the time
When they really take hold of my finger

In a continuous theme
That’s when they really take

a similar desire against me
without really agreeing

I have a memory between the day
without really speaking

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
without really breaking

already formely a long time
without really branding 

Where in me did I host
without really binding

already formerly a long time
without really needing

latency which doesn’t mean anything
also didn’t really move

joined me in wasting my vision
