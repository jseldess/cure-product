('me', 'reason')

Where I sleep at times
reasons resources

Itâ€™s time to wake up, Papa!
with reasons

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
with little reason to move

Since I can imagine movement
with little reasons to aspiration

with full potential to movement
with little reason to aspiration

since you can imagine movement
Toward the start informally given my reasons

The long time I had a vision
More reasons around my country 

and elsewhere my memory of you
and could be inflected with reasons

and came home to rewind
