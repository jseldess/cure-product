('me', 'reasons')

Where I sleep at times
reasons resources

Itâ€™s time to wake up, Papa!
with reasons

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
with little reasons to aspiration

Since I can imagine movement
with little reasons to move

with full potential to movement
Toward the start informally given my reasons

The long time I had a vision
More reasons around my country 

and elsewhere my memory of you
and could be inflected with reasons

and came home to rewind
