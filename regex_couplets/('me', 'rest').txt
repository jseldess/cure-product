('me', 'rest')

Where I sleep at times
wrestling to stay still

wrestling me to stay still
We can wrestle them with their goals

Then fall then summer
that agreed one of rest

Where in me did I host
Aligned or not with my interests

which I feel formerly about for
 as points which are my interest 

I have them trust in me
home rest form to ourselves 

that agreed home to people
