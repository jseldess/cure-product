('me', 'resume')

Where I sleep at times
So I presume the offers already

at home brought into privacy
and can’t presume to need

Then I can’t presume to need others
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to feed others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

at any time it can drift again
I resume unassimilable visions

The long time I had a vision
I resume indelible tracks

What was the last time
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

If I take a different measure
I resume attributable visions

If I take some different measure
I continue to presume

I continue to subsume
I presume to others

Where in me did I host
I presume the offers

brought messageable to you
So I resume the offers already

at home visions can be attainable
So I presume the offers

So I presume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home
I resume at home

presume the offers at 
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

I assume the offers reliable
