('me', 'retrieve')

Where I sleep at times
I send and retrieve the impulse

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

and elsewhere my memory 
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

already formely a long time
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

already formerly a long time
where I send and retrieve aside

Elsewhere my memory
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

But my not feeling the memory inside
where I stand and retrieve

dawn formerly
where I send and retrieve relive

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
retrieve 

firing and connecting somewhere
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

Formerly a way like this one
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

formerly a way
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

The other end of means
where I stand aside and retrieve

But my feeling the memory aside
