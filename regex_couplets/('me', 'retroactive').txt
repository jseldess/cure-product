('me', 'retroactive')

Where I sleep at times
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Then fall then summer from my face
In the retroactive light

Then fall then summer
In the light of retroactive conversations

When I want something
before we can have a retroactive

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
