('me', 'ring')

Where I sleep at times
interferring 

wrestling me to stay still
bring your child along

What does it mean to drift
ring

Then I canâ€™t presume to need others
hovering above standing water

emerging this year from standing water
actually considering the end

I resume unassimilable visions
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I resume attributable visions
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

If I take a different measure
wearing trying talking into it

without the long time I was on accounting
storing in surfeit

For an ungraspable time
firing and connecting somewhere

But my not feeling the memory aside
The prospect for veering healthily

I presume the offers
Or can have seen offering possession

I presume to others
and can see offering

I assumed that they were divisible
seen having or offering possession

I assume possession to others
in school and can see offering

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
can have seen offering possession
