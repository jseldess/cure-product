('me', 'say')

Where I sleep at times
we had to say goodbye

For an ungraspable time
We had to say goodbye there

And for an ungraspable time
I ask say in that case

Where in me did I host
we ask say in that case

A way formerly like this one
formerly along my say to the elections

formerly my way to the elections
I ask say in that phase decisioned

By my memory elsewhere
My say to the elections

which I feel formerly about for
