('me', 'seen')

Where I sleep at times
under the last seen principle

I resume attributable visions
Having seen more than 

I presume to others
being seen by me

So I found myself at home
the prospects being seen by me

at home brought into private
Having seen more than I can remember 

I have seen more than I can remember
Or can have seen offering possession

I assumed that they were divisible
seen having or offering possession

I assume possession to others
can have seen offering possession

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
