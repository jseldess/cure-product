('me', 'send')

Where I sleep at times
I send and retrieve the impulse

But my not feeling the memory aside
where I send and relive aside

and elsewhere my memory 
where I send and relive would be held

already formely a long time
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

Where in me did I last
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

already formerly a long time
where I send and retrieve aside

Elsewhere my memory
where I send and relive

But my not feeling the memory inside
where I send and retrieve relive

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I send and receive

for not paying sound overwhelmed
