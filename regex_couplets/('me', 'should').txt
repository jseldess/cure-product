('me', 'should')

Where I sleep at times
You should ask who I am

I assumed it was visible
While I should be sleeping

Then fall then summer
Looking back while I should be sleeping

In a continuous theme
While I should sleep not back in the results

emerging this year from standing water
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

And for an ungraspable time
One was up where it should be down

I could consume the dream
they should rise up

already formely a long time
the constituents should rise up

already formerly a long time
