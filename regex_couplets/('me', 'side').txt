('me', 'side')

Where I sleep at times
But that is beside the point

I assumed it was visible
Whereas direction is beside the point

into the minority proportion of time
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
I’m simply inside

only fragments of time with my children
aside from the retinas

Since I can imagine movement
actually considering the end

I resume unassimilable visions
But my not feeling the memory aside

and elsewhere my memory 
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

already formely a long time
where I send and relive aside

Where in me did I last
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

already formerly a long time
where I send and retrieve aside

Elsewhere my memory
But my not feeling the memory inside

dawn formerly
where I am aside at least

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I am aside

firing and connecting somewhere
by the side of the hosting service

by my memory 
By my feeling the memory inside

Formerly a way like this one
44 seconds inside

formerly my way 
where I stand aside

But my feeling the memory aside
where I am aside increased

joined me in wasting my vision
