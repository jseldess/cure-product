('me', 'skin')

Where I sleep at times
skin smile repeated expressions

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

When I want something
if not directly on my skin

only fragments of time with my children
sizes track for asking sound

A way formerly like this one
sizes asking for tracking sound

By my memory elsewhere
