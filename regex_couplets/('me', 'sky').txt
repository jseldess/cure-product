('me', 'sky')

Where I sleep at times
over the long time up in the sky

Then I constellate my time family country
over the long line up in the sky

over the time line I was on
Blue sky or

 and time in the train
until my purpose up in the sky

over the long time I was on
though not many facts up in the sky

I resume unassimilable visions
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

If I take a different measure
in not many tracks up in the sky

I resume attributable visions
Up in the sky

For an ungraspable time
My purpose up in the sky

And for an ungraspable time
While they’re up in the sky

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
While we’re up in the sky 

I had me a vision
until I purchase up the sky

I could consume the dream
