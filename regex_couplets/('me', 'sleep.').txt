('me', 'sleep.')

Where I sleep at times
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

I assumed it was visible
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
That’s where I sleep at times

in a moment of drifting away from the task
Interrupted sleep or

 and time in the train
While I should be sleeping

Then fall then summer
Looking back while I should be sleeping

In a continuous theme
While I should sleep not back in the results

emerging this year from standing water
like flattening sleep 

I resume attributable visions
