('me', 'space')

Where I sleep at times
in rotating directionless space

wrestling me to stay still
into rotating and directionless space

Then fall then summer
in the space that it had

by my memory
though we are breaking in the space that it had

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
in the fill space 

I have them trust in me
