('me', 'speak')

Where I sleep at times
not speaking

A way formerly like this one
without really speaking

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
I speak to them

But my not feeling the memory inside
would only speak willingly

for not paying sound overwhelmed
I speak to them my possessions

and move them literally with me
I speak them of my possessions

I presume to others
speak them of my possessions

Where in me did I host
