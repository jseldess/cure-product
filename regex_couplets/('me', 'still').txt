('me', 'still')

Where I sleep at times
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

I assumed it was visible
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
That is itself not still

wrestling me to stay still
russling to stay still

Then fall then summer
I love my daughter still

but would I love her the same
though we are still breaking in

A way formerly like this one
still wash conserving

Where in me pre-worn
so still them

after though there’s no memory
so still washed

Where in me did I loose
pre-worn and still wash them

Where in me did I lose trust
