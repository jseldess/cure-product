('me', 'story')

Where I sleep at times
I told her a story, she drew waves.

Itâ€™s time to wake up, Papa!
Forecasting the story before dawn

summer
as far back as my history heard

What was the last time
You need history

The long time I had a vision
for to tire as far back as my history

The long time I was a vision
for as far back as my history

I resume attributable visions
