('me', 'television')

Where I sleep at times
there wasn’t any television 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
up in the television pleasure

I resume unassimilable visions
up in the television

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
there was no television to hear

I resume attributable visions
joined in my television

joined me in wasting my vision
