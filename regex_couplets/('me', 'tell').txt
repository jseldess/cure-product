('me', 'tell')

Where I sleep at times
Then I constellate my time family country

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
So I constellate the time family country

over the long time up in the sky
I constellate the time

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
The CEO tells me to embody values

But not to me directly
I had to tell them the news

I had me a vision
I tell you my purposes

And for an ungraspable time
I tell you the weight of my purchases

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I tell you the weight of my purposes

I could consume the dream
and that man comes on to tell me 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
