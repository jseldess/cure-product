('me', 'than')

Where I sleep at times
It keeps coming down thankfully

Then fall then summer
than in the incoming stream

only fragments of time with my children
than solid ground

from home
Having seen more than 

I presume to others
Having seen more than I can remember 

I have seen more than I can remember
