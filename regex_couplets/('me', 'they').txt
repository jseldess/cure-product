('me', 'They')

Where I sleep at times
Theyâ€™re just not mine

wrestling me to stay still
They are called aspirational

I had me a vision
They can be waived

And for an ungraspable time
They can be weighed

I could consume the dream
They have very many choices

A way formerly like this one
They were filters

addition were filters formerly
