('me', 'through')

Where I sleep at times
You can hear it also through your leisure

Which is a measure to never live out
Back up through the results

In a continuous theme
back up through results

Then fall then summer
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

What was the last time
I cannot clear it also through investiture

I resume indelible tracks
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I resume attributable visions
You can hear it also through static leisure

If I take a different measure
I get through there

If I take some different measure
I get from here through there

I came back to me
in traversing get through there

I came after my past
get from here through there

I continue to presume
I get here through there

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
