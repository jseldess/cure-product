('me', 'time.')

Where I sleep at times
Then I constellate my time family country

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

I assumed it was visible
only fragments of time with my children

Then fall then summer
at any time it can drift again

What does it mean to drift
over the long time up in the sky

Then I can’t presume to need others
That’s where I sleep at times

in a moment of drifting away from the task
So I constellate the time family country

on the time line I was on
over the time line I was on

I constellate the time
 and time in the train

Some disease effecting the tree out front
I spend time online learning to code

In a continuous theme
On the timeline I was on

The timeline
over the long time I was on

Strategy comes before morning
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

I had me a vision
The long time I had a vision

without the long time I was accounting
The long time I was a vision

I resume attributable visions
which is the long time I was on

If I take a different measure
without the long time I was on accounting

without accounting the long time I was on
the long time I was on

If I take some different measure
in the long time they were on

I have them trust in me
or alter of course the time anyway

already formerly a long time
formerly a long time they were on

I have a memory between the day
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

washed my memory
until a happier time found

Where in me did I host
formerly along time they were on

I presume to others
time they were on

drawn formerly a long time
formerly along the time they were on

which I feel formerly about for
