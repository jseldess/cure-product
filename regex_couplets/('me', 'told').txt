('me', 'told')

Where I sleep at times
I told her a story, she drew waves.

Itâ€™s time to wake up, Papa!
I am told ventillation

on the time line I was on
I am told by no ventillation

over the time line I was on
I am told by the ventillation

Strategy comes before morning
which ran to be told

for not paying sound overwhelmed
