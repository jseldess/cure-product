('me', 'too.')

Where I sleep at times
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

I assumed it was visible
too sunny to eat ice cream

Then fall then summer from my face
emerging this year from too much standing water

to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water
learned without too much difficulty to code

Strategy comes before morning
Selma knows too 

But my not feeling the memory inside
