('me', 'trust')

Where I sleep at times
I have them trust in me

in the long time they were on
in the form filled offered in trust

Elsewhere by my memory
about the sight hosting trusting

by my memory 
in the form filled offered trust

washed by my memory
Where in me did I lose trust

Where did I lose trust in me
Where did we lose trust

already formerly a long time
