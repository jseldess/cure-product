('me', 'turn')

Where I sleep at times
in a sharp downward turn 

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
In a sharp downard turn

Then fall then summer from my face
sudden downward turn

over the long time up in the sky
I keep turning back again myself

Then fall then summer
I keep turning back

In a continuous theme
who knows how to turn it off

But my not feeling the memory inside
Bach helps turn it off

Formerly a way like this one
I turn not sad exactly

By my memory elsewhere
I return not sad exactly

which I feel formerly about for
I returned not sad exactly

I have them trust in me
I returned

I can’t remember them
