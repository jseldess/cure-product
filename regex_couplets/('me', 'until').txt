('me', 'until')

Where I sleep at times
until my purpose up in the sky

over the time line I was on
until I could not tire 

What was the last time
until I could not be tired

I need an explicit statement
until I could not be hired

I resume attributable visions
until I purpose up in the sky

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
until I purchase up the sky

And for an ungraspable time
until I purchase the sky

I could consume the dream
until the bill came

My means without gravity
until a happier time found

Where in me did I host
