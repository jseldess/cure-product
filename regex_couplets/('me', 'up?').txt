('me', 'up?')

Where I sleep at times
Ask who I am to suspend

I assumed it was visible
into the stream of pictures

into the minority proportion of time
The sun isn’t up 

So I presume the offers already
at home brought into privacy

So I find myself at home
already brought into privacy

brought messageable to you
Then I cannot see face value

Then I constellate my time family country
reasons resources

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i
What is an impure product

Then fall then summer from my face
my children’s consumption

Then fall then summer
In a sharp downard turn

When I want something
conversation with our feelings

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

only fragments of time with my children
interjecting into the stream of pictures

wrestling me to stay still
russling to stay still

Which is a measure to never live out
as a pure product

and can’t presume to need
But I can’t let myself treat 

Then I can’t presume to need others
as an impure product

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
and is relentlessly budgeted

What does it mean to drift
Puffs of air

over the long time up in the sky
I’ll get there eventually

at any time it can drift again
in a sharp downward turn 

That’s where I sleep at times
sudden downward turn

So I constellate the time family country
The South Carolina primary 

on the time line I was on
way high up in the internet

over the time line I was on
by no ventillation my purpose

I constellate the time
not one virtue to excess

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
when we had jobs that was to churn some bread

 and time in the train
May I have your zip code

Some disease effecting the tree out front
fish pulled out of the lake

The CEO tells me to embody values
But not to me directly

I spend time online learning to code
Spinning around the heart

In a continuous theme
I put my bread down

and the graph ahead of me
I keep turning back

a similar desire against me
an unassimilable desire against me

emerging this year from standing water
to see the ruins

emerging this year from too much standing water
to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water

I had me a vision
And as an extension of the values

On the timeline I was on
Then the sun isn’t up 

summer
The sun shielding from

Booked with a meeting
I’ll pull myself higher up

over the long time I was on
until my purpose up in the sky

Strategy comes before morning
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Its strategy comes before morning goals
but the sun isn’t up

Strategy comes before goals
barely outlines

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
I just got a letter

since I can imagine movement
I am full of potential

with full potential to movement
since you can imagine movement

I invited most of what came next
I had nightmares though

Would I love the same stuff
white spots on a black surface

but would I love her the same
If I take a different measure

If I take some different measure
What I do in my liesure

The long time I had a vision
without the long time I was accounting

Would I love the same
Undoubtedly 

promoting from home to a new job
no solid ground to continue along

promoting from home
where you can earn more 

from home
walking along the measure

walking from home along the measure
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I resume unassimilable visions
I reuse indelible tracks 

What was the last time
I can hear them between bills and stuff

will not be the same
that I hear without trying

in the time
actually considering the end

explicit statements
up in the television pleasure

I resume indelible tracks
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

wrapped in static and explicit statements
I cannot clear it also through investiture

wrapped in static implicit statements
though as for conversing

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
up in the television

I resume attributable visions
in traversing my purchase

I need an explicit statement
until I could not be tired

advancing the time
around my country 

The long time I was a vision
until I could not be hired

which is the long time I was on
like un

without the long time I was on accounting
without accounting the long time I was on

which is all the time
I could in effect credit

in the long time they were on
I have them trust in me

that will spur me on
in conversing of my purpose

that will try me on 
of my purpose in conversing

I came back to me
I captured an afterimage

I came after my past
under the last seen principle

I continue to presume
attributable visions

I continue to subsume
I continue to consume

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
a futile joyous white sun

having been an ungraspable time
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

I could consume the dream
without ensuing damage

For an ungraspable time
articles all around us

And for an ungraspable time
I have supporters

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
While we’re up in the sky 

I let it remind me again
while consuming damage

without consumer damage
Then I continue to dream then

My means without gravity
I capture an afterimage

to any consumer damage
without longer damage

until the bill came
That I captured an afterimage

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
I shivered looking up

And we could inhabit the room easy

and elsewhere my memory of you
I have entered my purchases

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

A way formerly like this one
The constituents would be helped

But my not feeling the memory inside

By my feeling the memory inside
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

Formerly away there are constant ways
I end up in Bach with constant ways

I answered what I thought

But my feeling the memory aside

radiating from housing

I answered what I thought about
