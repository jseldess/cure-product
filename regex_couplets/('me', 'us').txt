Where I sleep at times
Ask who I am to suspend

I assumed it was visible
I suspend live connections to you

into the minority proportion of time
asynchronous 

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
because it was really dark

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

When I want something
They’re just not mine

wrestling me to stay still
russling to stay still

Then fall then summer
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Then I can’t presume to need others
I want to cite a poem so usual

So I constellate the time family country
was not just a defeat

 and time in the train
In a vertiginous dream

Some disease effecting the tree out front
in a continuous vertiginous dream

The CEO tells me to embody values
You use the most essential parts

In a continuous theme
Remnant continuous pages

emerging this year from standing water
The ventillation rushes on

Strategy comes before morning
I just got a letter

I had me a vision
So stay with us

with full potential to movement
but it continued rippling muscle

since you can imagine movement
I reuse unassimilable visions

The long time I had a vision
because there was no solid ground to continue along

from home
I reuse indelible tracks 

without the long time I was accounting
I refuse indelible tracts

explicit statements
it was not just a defeat

advancing the time
I have them trust in me

in the long time they were on
a futile joyous white sun

I came after my past
Articles all around us

For an ungraspable time
I wear suspenders

And for an ungraspable time
I used my technology

or in some imaginary elsewhere
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

or alter of course the time anyway
in the form filled offered in trust

The trackers on users

A way formerly like this one
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

already formerly a long time
useless for not having paid

Where in me did I host
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

washed by my memory
about the sight hosting trusting

by my memory 
in the form filled offered trust

Where in me did I loose
in the form filled offered must

Where in me pre-worn
Where in me did I lose trust

Where did I lose trust in me
Where did we lose trust

I assumed 
radiating from housing

but for memory elsewhere
