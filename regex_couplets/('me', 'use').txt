('me', 'use')

Where I sleep at times
because it was really dark

Itâ€™s time to wake up, Papa!
You use the most essential parts

In a continuous theme
I reuse unassimilable visions

The long time I had a vision
because there was no solid ground to continue along

from home
I reuse indelible tracks 

without the long time I was accounting
I refuse indelible tracts

explicit statements
I used my technology

And for an ungraspable time
trackers collecting data on users

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
The trackers on users

A way formerly like this one
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

already formerly a long time
useless for not having paid

Where in me did I host
