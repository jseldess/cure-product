('me', 'waiting')

Where I sleep at times
There are spots waiting

or in some imaginary elsewhere
Though we are waiting for her

already formerly a long time
Though we are waiting 

Where in me did I host
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

But my not feeling the memory inside
waiting out front or up above 

I have them trust in me
