('me', 'walk')

Where I sleep at times
Before we walk across the wide field

Then I constellate my time family country
Before we walk across the wide opening

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Then fall then summer
Before anyone walks across the opening

only fragments of time with my children
there was no walking along the pleasure

I had me a vision
there was no walking along

promoting from home
walking along the measure

walking from home along the measure
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

advancing the time
walking into percents blending themselves

If I take a different measure
