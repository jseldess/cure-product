('me', 'want')

Where I sleep at times
When I want something

Then fall then summer
I want to find a way to block it incoming

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
That’s exaclty what I want for them

only fragments of time with my children
I want but not to impart cynicism

Which is a measure to never live out
I want to cite a poem so usual

So I constellate the time family country
I want to cite a poem

 and time in the train
all that I can think I want

I resume unassimilable visions
