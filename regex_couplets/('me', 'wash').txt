('me', 'wash')

Where I sleep at times
washed by my memory

by my memory
washed my memory

A way formerly like this one
still wash conserving

Where in me pre-worn
washed

By my memory elsewhere
washed I answered about

after though thereâ€™s no memory
so still washed

Where in me did I loose
pre-worn and still wash them

Where in me did I lose trust
