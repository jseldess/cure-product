('me', 'watch')

Where I sleep at times
when watching tv

I had me a vision
in the sense of watching

If I take a different measure
I watch a movie

If I take some different measure
always watching

which is all the time
I watch a moving afterimage

I came after my past
When I'm watching my tv 

and that man comes on to tell me 
so still watch them

Where in me pre-worn
where Iâ€™m watching my tv

But my feeling the memory aside
