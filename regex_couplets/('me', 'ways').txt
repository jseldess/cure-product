('me', 'ways')

Where I sleep at times
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i
always watching

which is all the time
deep into pathways from repeated travels

But my not feeling the memory aside
with constant ways 

But my not feeling the memory inside
with her ways to the ends

Formerly a way like this one
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

formerly a way
There are constant ways

The other end of means
Formerly away there are constant ways

By my feeling the memory inside
with constant ways to the other end

formerly my way
