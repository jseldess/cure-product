('me', 'We')

Where I sleep at times
We’ll have coffee this morning

I assumed it was visible
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

into the minority proportion of time
We can wrestle them with their goals

Then fall then summer
We had to say goodbye there

For an ungraspable time
We had to buy there

And for an ungraspable time
We had inhabited actually

Or alter of course the time anyway
We got paid one way by a voice

and elsewhere my memory of you
We ask say in that case

I can’t remember them
