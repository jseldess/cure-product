('me', 'were')

Where I sleep at times
When we had jobs that were to earn

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
my desires were open

The CEO tells me to embody values
I wish my desires were open

Then fall then summer
I argued the days were longer

I had me a vision
I agrued the days were longer

since I can imagine movement
The days were long

with full potential to movement
I argued that the days were longer

since you can imagine movement
The days were long aligned

Would I love the same stuff
they were on

If I take a different measure
in the long time they were on

I have them trust in me
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
formerly a long time they were on

I have a memory between the day
answered about 

But my not feeling the memory aside
by the sight of the hosting answered about

by my memory 
I answered about

By my memory elsewhere
washed I answered about

washed by my memory
formerly along time they were on

I presume to others
I answered what I thought

shone formerly a long time
time they were on

drawn formerly a long time
I answered while interfaced

but for memory elsewhere
They were filters

addition were filters formerly
I answered what I thought about

but standing in memory
formerly along the time they were on

which I feel formerly about for
that they were visible

and came home to rewind inflections
that they were divisible

and came home to rewind
I assumed that they were divisible

and come home to remind inflections
