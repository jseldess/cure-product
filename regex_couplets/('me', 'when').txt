('me', 'When')

Where I sleep at times
When I woke up in the morning

Then fall then summer from my face
When I want something

Then fall then summer
When we had jobs that were to earn

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
When they really take hold of my finger

In a continuous theme
When closed to my knowing

If I take some different measure
When I'm watching my tv 

and that man comes on to tell me
