('me', 'white')

Where I sleep at times
white spots on a black surface

but would I love her the same
black spots on a white surface

I resume unassimilable visions
a futile joyous white sun

I came after my past
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
