('me', 'will')

Where I sleep at times
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

only fragments of time with my children
on a day there will be direction

wrestling me to stay still
will not be the same

in the time
that will spur me on

that will try me on 
would only willingly break

for not paying sound overwhelmed
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

Where in me did I host
my daughter will learn 

A way formerly like this one
