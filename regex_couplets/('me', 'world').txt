('me', 'world')

Where I sleep at times
off the edge of the world

Then I constellate my time family country
Which can be pronounced to the world

So I constellate the time family country
The world 

Then fall then summer
off the end of the world

I had me a vision
hauling off the end of the world

I resume unassimilable visions
falling off the end of the world

will not be the same
the opinions in my world

for not paying sound overwhelmed
