('me', 'you.')

Where I sleep at times
Though how can you know without direction

Then fall then summer
You can hear it also through your leisure

Which is a measure to never live out
bring your child along

What does it mean to drift
if you have providence to excess

So I constellate the time family country
If you have confidence regardless all else

 and time in the train
May I have your zip code

Some disease effecting the tree out front
That you can see only the back of

I had me a vision
since you can imagine movement

Since I can imagine movement
where you can earn more 

from home
you need history

The long time I was a vision
a futile joyous white sun

I came after my past
I tell you my purposes

And for an ungraspable time
I tell you the weight of my purchases

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I tell you the weight of my purposes

I could consume the dream
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
This is your voice 

and elsewhere my memory of you
This is your chance

But my not feeling the memory aside
the young ripples inaudibly

I have them trust in me
