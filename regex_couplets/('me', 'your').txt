('me', 'your')

Where I sleep at times
You can hear it also through your leisure

Which is a measure to never live out
bring your child along

What does it mean to drift
May I have your zip code

Then fall then summer
your bid to the next highest ranked network

I had me a vision
This is your voice 

and elsewhere my memory of you
This is your chance

But my not feeling the memory aside
