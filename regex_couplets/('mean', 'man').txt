('mean', 'man')

What does it mean to drift
Walt Whitman drifted

My means without gravity
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything
and that man comes on to tell me 

The other end of means
The many transparent pixel calls

To the other end of means like this one
