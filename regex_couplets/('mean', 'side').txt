('mean', 'side')

What does it mean to drift
aside from the retinas

My means without gravity
But my not feeling the memory aside

latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything
by the side of the hosting service

The other end of means
But my not feeling the memory inside

To the other end of means like this one
44 seconds inside
