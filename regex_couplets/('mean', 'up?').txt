('mean', 'up?')

What does it mean to drift
Puffs of air

My means without gravity
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything
until a happier time found

The other end of means
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

To the other end of means like this one
I end up Bach
