('middle', 'offer')

Toward the middle of the sixteenth century
in the form filled offered in trust

stopping in the middle
So I presume the offers already

stepping in the middle
So I resume the offers already

stepping off into the middle
I presume the offers

stepping off in to the middle
Or can have seen offering possession
