('mine', 'inter')

Theyâ€™re just not mine
way high up in the inter

The third letter from the end is mine
with internally regulated climate

The ads in mine
Then I saw them interview

To the right of determined elections
To the right of interned possessions

determined by elections
To the right of interned elections
