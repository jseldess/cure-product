('more', 'while')

But in more 
Looking back while I should be sleeping

where you can earn more 
while wrapped in static

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
while wrapped in explicit static

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
I answered while interfaced

more to ourselves insure
for a while to listen already

Having seen more than I can remember
