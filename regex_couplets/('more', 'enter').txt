('more', 'enter')

But in more 
The sun high enough to enter directly 

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
I enter the flattening mirror

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
I have entered my phone

which feels more comfortable
I had entered my phone

more to ourselves insure
