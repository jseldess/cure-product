('morning', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

We’ll have coffee this morning
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
I’m simply inside

before morning goals
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

Strategy comes before morning
where I’m watching my tv
