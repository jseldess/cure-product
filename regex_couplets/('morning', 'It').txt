('morning', 'It')

We’ll have coffee this morning
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

When I woke up in the morning
It keeps coming down thankfully

before morning goals
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

Strategy comes before morning
It’s morning 

Its strategy comes before morning goals
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
