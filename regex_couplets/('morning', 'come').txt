('morning', 'come')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

When I woke up in the morning
Strategy comes before morning

Before morning goals
after having been contented Strategy comes before morning

Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals
Its strategy comes before morning goals

It’s morning 
Strategy comes before goals
