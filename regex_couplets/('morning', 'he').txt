('morning', 'he')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Where I sleep at times

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

When I woke up in the morning
Then fall then summer from my face

before morning goals
Then I cannot see face value

Strategy comes before morning
I am the first in the office

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning
Then the sun isn’t up

It’s morning 
but the sun isn’t up
