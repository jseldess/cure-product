('morning', 'rate')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

When I woke up in the morning
and my heart rate

before morning goals
Strategy comes before morning

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

It’s morning 
Its strategy comes before morning goals
