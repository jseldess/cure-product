('morning', 'too.')

We’ll have coffee this morning
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
too sunny to eat ice cream

before morning goals
learned without too much difficulty to code

Strategy comes before morning
Selma knows too
