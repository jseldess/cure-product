('morning', 'up?')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Arrayed out in such a nested way

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

When I woke up in the morning
it was really sunny

before morning goals
barely outlines

Strategy comes before morning
Then the sun isn’t up

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Its strategy comes before morning goals
but the sun isn’t up

It’s morning 
Then I cannot see face value
