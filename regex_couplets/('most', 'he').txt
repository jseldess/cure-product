('most', 'he')

though it was most emphatically that
I constellate the time

You use the most essential parts
Even before the lesson starts

I invited most of what came next
that I was the arm of this

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
washed my memory

which feels most comfortable
when it is not literal

most comfortable
Where in me did I lose

mostly along cables
where I am aside

at least most days
the least productive of myself
