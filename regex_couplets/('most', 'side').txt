('most', 'side')

though it was most emphatically that
aside from the retinas

I invited most of what came next
actually considering the end

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

which feels most comfortable
by the side of the hosting service

mostly along cables
where I am aside

at least most days
But my not feeling the memory aside
