('move', 'Thou')

since I can imagine movement
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
Though we are waiting for her

and literally moved
Though we are breaking 

myself moved literally as it is
Though we are waiting 

I move
Though we can’t help waiting

not literally moved about
