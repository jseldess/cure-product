('move', 'any')

since I can imagine movement
The days aligned for company

with little reasons to move
The days aligned long company

with little reason to move
That company creates a life

with full potential to movement
there wasn’t any television 

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

and literally moved
if there is anything 

myself moved literally as it is
latency which doesn’t mean anything

and literally moved about
if that has anything

I literally moved
The many transparent pixel calls

not literally moved about
or imagined anyway
