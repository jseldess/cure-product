('move', 'he')

since I can imagine movement
The days are long

with little reason to move
across the retinas

with little reasons to move
And as an extension of the values

with full potential to movement
that I was the arm of this

since you can imagine movement
The days were long

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses

and literally moved
if there is anything 

myself moved literally as it is
and for which the plan agreed

I move
when I move

and move them literally with me
I literally move them

literally move
The floor slanted in places

and literally moved about
and to which the plan agreed

I literally moved
When I'm watching my tv 

literally moved
in the space that it had

what literally moved
in the face that it had

not literally moved about
washed I answered about

also didnâ€™t really move
By my memory elsewhere

not literally moved
I stay the right of my elections
