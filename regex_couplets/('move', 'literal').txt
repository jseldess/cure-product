('move', 'literal')

since I can imagine movement
and literally moved

myself moved literally as it is
and literally moved about

I move
I literally moved

when I move
and it’s not literal

and move them literally with me
I literally move them

literally move
literally moved

what literally moved
not literally moved about

also didn’t really move
not literally moved
