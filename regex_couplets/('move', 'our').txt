('move', 'our')

since I can imagine movement
You can hear it also through your leisure

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
or alter of course the time anyway

and literally moved
reasons resources

myself moved literally as it is
Who throws contours away

not literally moved about
phrase them of our possessions
