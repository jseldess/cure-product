('move', 'time.')

since I can imagine movement
The long time I had a vision

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
or alter of course the time anyway

and literally moved
So I constellate the time family country

myself moved literally as it is
formerly a long time they were on

and literally moved about
formerly along time they were on

not literally moved about
in the long time they were on

not literally moved
