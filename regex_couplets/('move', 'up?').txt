('move', 'up?')

since I can imagine movement
I am full of potential

with full potential to movement
since you can imagine movement

with little reason to move
I argued that the days were longer

with little reasons to move
And as an extension of the values

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
a futile joyous white sun

and literally moved
without really agreeing

myself moved literally as it is
and literally moved about

I move
it can be uncomfortable 

and move them literally with me
without their agreement

literally move
without really needing

I literally moved
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

literally moved
in the form filled offered in trust

what literally moved
redundant

not literally moved about
washed I answered about

also didn’t really move
my daughter’s squirrel and chickadee joined me

not literally moved
which I feel formerly about for
