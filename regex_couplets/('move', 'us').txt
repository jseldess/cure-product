('move', 'us')

since I can imagine movement
So stay with us

with little reason to move
but it continued rippling muscle

with full potential to movement
I reuse unassimilable visions

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
a futile joyous white sun

and literally moved
I want to cite a poem so usual

myself moved literally as it is
in the form filled offered in trust

I move
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

literally moved
about the sight hosting trusting

not literally moved about
in the form filled offered must

also didnâ€™t really move
radiating from housing

not literally moved
I have them trust in me
