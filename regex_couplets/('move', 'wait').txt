('move', 'wait')

since I can imagine movement
There are spots waiting

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
Though we are waiting for her

and literally moved
not needing to wait

myself moved literally as it is
Though we are waiting 

I move
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

not literally moved about
waiting out front or up above
