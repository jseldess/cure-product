('move', 'you.')

since I can imagine movement
since you can imagine movement

with little reason to move
where you can earn more 

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
a futile joyous white sun

and literally moved
You can hear it also through your leisure

myself moved literally as it is
the young ripples inaudibly
