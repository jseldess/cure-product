('moved', 'he')

and literally moved
if there is anything 

myself moved literally as it is
and for which the plan agreed

I literally moved
when I move

and literally moved about
The floor slanted in places

literally moved
in the space that it had

what literally moved
in the face that it had

not literally moved about
washed I answered about

not literally moved
I stay the right of my elections
