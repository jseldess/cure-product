('moved', 'up?')

and literally moved
without really agreeing

myself moved literally as it is
and literally moved about

I literally moved
it can be uncomfortable 

literally moved
in the form filled offered in trust

what literally moved
redundant

not literally moved about
washed I answered about

not literally moved
which I feel formerly about for
