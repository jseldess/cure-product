('moved', 'us')

and literally moved
I want to cite a poem so usual

myself moved literally as it is
in the form filled offered in trust

I literally moved
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

literally moved
about the sight hosting trusting

not literally moved about
in the form filled offered must

not literally moved
I have them trust in me
