('myself', 'A')

So I find myself at home
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

But I can’t let myself treat 
And as an extension of the values

I was enjoined to act again myself
BREAK

If I let myself see others desires
And make myself a visible

I’ll pull myself higher up
After having been contented

I keep turning back again myself
A turtle fished out of the lake

I’ll pull myself another personality type
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

off the end myself
As an extension of the values

myself
CONTRACT

the least productive of myself
Aligned or not with my interests

So I found myself at home
All that I own messageable
