('myself', 'but')

So I find myself at home
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

But I can’t let myself treat 
Attributable or

I keep turning back again myself
but the sun isn’t up

I was enjoined to act again myself
but it continued

off the end myself
but it continued rippling muscle

myself
that decisions can be attributable

the least productive of myself
but for memory elsewhere

So I found myself at home
revisions that can be attributable
