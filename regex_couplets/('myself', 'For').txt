('myself', 'For')

So I find myself at home
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Forecasting the story before dawn

I’ll pull myself higher up
For an ungraspable time

myself
Formerly a way like this one

the least productive of myself
For a while I think I don’t listen
