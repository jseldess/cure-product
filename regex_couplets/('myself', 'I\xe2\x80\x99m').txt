('myself', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

So I find myself at home
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

But I can’t let myself treat 
Right now I’m the cart

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

I was enjoined to act again myself
where I’m watching my tv

the least productive of myself
