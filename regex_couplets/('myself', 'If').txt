('myself', 'if')

So I find myself at home
drifting away

But I can’t let myself treat 
drifting away needs others presume desires

If I let myself see others desires
at any time it can drift again

I let myself treat
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I’ll pull myself another personality type
drifting away needs

I was enjoined to act again myself
drifting away from the task

But I can’t let myself disregard
if you have providence to excess

I keep turning back again myself
out of the fifth page ruins

I’ll pull myself higher up
learned without too much difficulty to code

off the end myself
That company creates a life

myself
if there is anything 

the least productive of myself
if only on the way to the trash

So I found myself at home
