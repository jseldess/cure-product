('myself', 'so')

So I find myself at home
I’ll pull myself another personality type

But I can’t let myself treat 
reasons resources

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
soft paper

If I let myself see others desires
You can hear it also through your leisure

And make myself a visible
solvents

I keep turning back again myself
A person from a distance

I was enjoined to act again myself
or an available resource

I’ll pull myself higher up
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

off the end myself
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I was bid to act again myself
My associations

I was enjoying acting against myself
with little reason to move

myself
so still watch them

the least productive of myself
also didn’t really move

So I found myself at home
and could be inflected with reasons
