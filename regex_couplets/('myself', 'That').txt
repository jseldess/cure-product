('myself', 'That')

So I find myself at home
That’s exaclty what I want for them

But I can’t let myself treat 
That’s where I sleep at times

I let myself treat
That’s when they really take

I keep turning back again myself
That you can see only the back of

I was enjoined to act again myself
That company creates a life

myself
That are my right to say

So I found myself at home
