('myself', 'There')

So I find myself at home
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

But I can’t let myself treat 
There are quarterly goals

I was enjoined to act again myself
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I keep turning back again myself
There was very little physical activity

off the end myself
There are spots waiting

myself
There are constant ways

the least productive of myself
