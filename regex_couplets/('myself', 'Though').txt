('myself', 'though')

So I find myself at home
As though stationary and a destination

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
though it was most emphatically that

I keep turning back again myself
I had nightmares though

myself
I thought

the least productive of myself
I answered what I thought

So I found myself at home
