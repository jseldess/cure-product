('myself', 'To')

So I find myself at home
To my children Walt Whitman

But I can’t let myself treat 
To my chidren

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

I keep turning back again myself
To that impossible place

I was enjoined to act again myself
Tomorrow

off the end myself
Toward the start informally given my reasons

myself
To the ends of transactions

the least productive of myself
To the right of determined elections

So I found myself at home
