('myself', 'Which')

So I find myself at home
Which is a measure to never live out

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
Which can be pronounced to the world

I keep turning back again myself
Which is a pleasure to never live out

myself
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

the least productive of myself
