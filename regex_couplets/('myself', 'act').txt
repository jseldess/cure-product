('myself', 'act')

So I find myself at home
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

But I can’t let myself treat 
I was enjoined to act again myself

I let myself treat
I was enjoined to act again

I’ll pull myself higher up
and strategies not tactics

off the end myself
I was enjoying acting against myself

I was bid to act again myself
I was big to act again

myself
the ends of my transactions

the least productive of myself
I turn not sad exactly

So I found myself at home
before I act on them
