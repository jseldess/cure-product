('myself', 'any')

So I find myself at home
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

But I can’t let myself treat 
at any time it can drift again

I let myself treat
Or the company

I keep turning back again myself
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

off the end myself
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I was enjoined to act again myself
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

I was bid to act again myself
Since I had to hold the entire company

I was enjoying acting against myself
The days aligned for company

myself
latency which doesn’t mean anything

the least productive of myself
or imagined anyway

So I found myself at home
