('myself', 'are')

So I find myself at home
Though there are quarters goals

But I can’t let myself treat 
who are so fresh and agile

I’ll pull myself another personality type
There are quarterly goals

I was enjoined to act again myself
barely outlines

off the end myself
The days are long

I was bid to act again myself
I had nightmares though

myself
Though we are waiting 

the least productive of myself
That are my right to say

So I found myself at home
careening between the preambles
