('myself', 'away')

So I find myself at home
drifting away

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
drifting away needs others presume desires

If I let myself see others desires
drifting away needs

I was enjoined to act again myself
drifting away from the task

I let myself treat
Who throws contours away

the least productive of myself
