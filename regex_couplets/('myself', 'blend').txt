('myself', 'blend')

So I find myself at home
battery dawn nights blending themselves

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
walking into percents blending themselves

myself
where lights blended themselves

the least productive of myself
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

So I found myself at home
