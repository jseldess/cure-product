('myself', 'brought')

So I find myself at home
already brought into privacy

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
I brought my head down

I keep turning back again myself
I brought my qualities down

I was enjoined to act again myself
own stays brought loyal

the least productive of myself
at home brought into privacy

So I found myself at home
at home brought into private
