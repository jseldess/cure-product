('myself', 'call')

So I find myself at home
not calling or echoing for once

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
though it was most emphatically that

I keep turning back again myself
They are called aspirational

I was enjoined to act again myself
Which can be called confidence

myself
The many transparent pixel calls

the least productive of myself
recalling aside

So I found myself at home
