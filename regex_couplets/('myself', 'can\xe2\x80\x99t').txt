('myself', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

So I find myself at home
I can’t fix them without direction

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

If I let myself see others desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

I let myself treat
Then I can’t presume to treat others

But I can’t let myself disregard
That can’t be glimpsed

I was enjoined to act again myself
Though we can’t help waiting

the least productive of myself
I can’t remember them

So I found myself at home
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
