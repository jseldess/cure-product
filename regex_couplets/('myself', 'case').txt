('myself', 'case')

So I find myself at home
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
only in the case

I keep turning back again myself
I ask say in that case

the least productive of myself
We ask say in that case

So I found myself at home
