('myself', 'children')

So I find myself at home
On a snow day with my children

But I can’t let myself treat 
To my children Walt Whitman

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Even the children

myself
my possession of my children

the least productive of myself
speech my possession of my children

So I found myself at home
