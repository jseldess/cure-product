('myself', 'code')

So I find myself at home
as long as I have access to the code

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
May I have your zip code

I keep turning back again myself
I spend time online learning to code

I was enjoined to act again myself
learned without too much difficulty to code

off the end myself
falling off the encoded end

myself
zipcode

the least productive of myself
