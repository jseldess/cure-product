('myself', 'come')

So I find myself at home
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
Strategy comes before morning

I was enjoined to act again myself
and that man comes on to tell me 

the least productive of myself
and come home to remind inflections
