('myself', 'day')

So I find myself at home
On a snow day with my children

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
I argued the days felt longer

I was enjoined to act again myself
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

off the end myself
The days long aligned

I was enjoying acting against myself
I argued the days were longer

I was bid to act again myself
The days aligned for company

myself
at least most days

the least productive of myself
