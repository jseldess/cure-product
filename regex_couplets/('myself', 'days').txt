('myself', 'days')

So I find myself at home
I argued the days felt longer

I was enjoined to act again myself
The days long aligned

I was enjoying acting against myself
I argued the days were longer

off the end myself
The days aligned for company

I was bid to act again myself
The days are long

myself
at least most days

the least productive of myself
