('myself', 'desire')

So I find myself at home
others desires

But I can’t let myself treat 
If I let myself see others desires

I let myself treat
drifting away needs others presume desires

But I can’t let myself disregard
Others desires as legitimate

I’ll pull myself another personality type
my desires were open

I keep turning back again myself
I wish my desires were open

I was enjoined to act again myself
