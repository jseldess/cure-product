('myself', 'do')

So I find myself at home
in a sharp downward turn 

But I can’t let myself treat 
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I’ll pull myself another personality type
to the down arrow

I let myself treat
The dogs and lillies

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
I brought my head down

I keep turning back again myself
I brought my qualities down

I was enjoined to act again myself
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

off the end myself
What I do in my liesure

myself
latency which doesn’t mean anything

the least productive of myself
I only think I don’t listen
