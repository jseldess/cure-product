('myself', 'does')

So I find myself at home
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

But I can’t let myself treat 
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I’ll pull myself another personality type
and it doesn’t take long

myself
latency which doesn’t mean anything

the least productive of myself
