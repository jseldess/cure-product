('myself', 'down')

So I find myself at home
in a sharp downward turn 

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
to the down arrow

I let myself treat
I brought my head down

I keep turning back again myself
I brought my qualities down

I was enjoined to act again myself
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

myself
