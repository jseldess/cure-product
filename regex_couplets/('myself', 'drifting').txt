('myself', 'drifting')

So I find myself at home
drifting away

But I can’t let myself treat 
drifting away needs others presume desires

If I let myself see others desires
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I’ll pull myself another personality type
drifting away needs

I was enjoined to act again myself
drifting away from the task

I let myself treat
