('myself', 'earn')

So I find myself at home
in light of learning what we see

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
When we had jobs that were to earn

I keep turning back again myself
I spend time online learning to code

I was enjoined to act again myself
learned without too much difficulty to code

off the end myself
where you can earn more 

myself
decisioned to learn 

the least productive of myself
I learned my location

So I found myself at home
