('myself', 'eat')

So I find myself at home
too sunny to eat ice cream

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to treat others

I let myself treat
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

If I let myself see others desires
executive breath

I’ll pull myself another personality type
execute breath

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
was not just a defeat

I keep turning back again myself
Where I put it beating

I was enjoined to act again myself
of the habits I create

off the end myself
of the habits they create.

I was enjoying acting against myself
That company creates a life

myself
for the creation of the universe

the least productive of myself
