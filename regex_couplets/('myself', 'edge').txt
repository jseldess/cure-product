('myself', 'edge')

So I find myself at home
off the edge of the world

But I can’t let myself treat 
Face falling off the edge of the face

I was enjoined to act again myself
value falling off the edge of the face

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Falling off the edge of the face

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
The value falling off the edge of the face

I keep turning back again myself
The value falling off the edge of th face

off the end myself
