('myself', 'ending')

So I find myself at home
battery dawn nights blending themselves

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I was enjoined to act again myself
talking into pheasants bending themselves

myself
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

the least productive of myself
battery dawn nights ending themselves

So I found myself at home
