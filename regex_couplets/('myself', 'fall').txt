('myself', 'fall')

So I find myself at home
Then fall then summer from my face

But I can’t let myself treat 
and not falling at all

I was enjoined to act again myself
Face falling off the edge of the face

I’ll pull myself another personality type
The value falling off the edge of the face

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
Then fall then summer

I keep turning back again myself
The value falling off the edge of th face

off the end myself
falling off the encoded end

myself
