('myself', 'feel')

So I find myself at home
conversations with our feelings

But I can’t let myself treat 
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I was enjoined to act again myself
I tried to feel the extension of key values

off the end myself
What would I feel without that goal

myself
which feels most comfortable

the least productive of myself
But my not feeling the memory aside

the least instructive of myself
which I feel formerly about for

So I found myself at home
