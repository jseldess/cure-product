('myself', 'front')

So I find myself at home
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

I keep turning back again myself
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

I was enjoined to act again myself
in front of the set of regulations

off the end myself
And need out in front purchase

myself
behind or out front or up above

So I found myself at home
