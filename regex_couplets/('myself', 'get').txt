('myself', 'get')

So I find myself at home
I’ll get there eventually

But I can’t let myself treat 
and is relentlessly budgeted

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I’ll get there ruins

I was enjoined to act again myself
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

off the end myself
I get through there

myself
forgetting decisions 

the least productive of myself
forgettable
