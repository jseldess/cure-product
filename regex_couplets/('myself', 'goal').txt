('myself', 'goal')

So I find myself at home
Though there are quarters goals

But I can’t let myself treat 
and without quartely goals

I’ll pull myself another personality type
There are quarterly goals

I was enjoined to act again myself
before morning goals

off the end myself
What would I feel without that goal

myself
