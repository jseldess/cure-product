('myself', 'have')

So I find myself at home
I have entered my phone

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
if you have providence to excess

I keep turning back again myself
If you have confidence regardless all else

myself
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

the least productive of myself
I have them lost

So I found myself at home
I have seen more than I can remember
