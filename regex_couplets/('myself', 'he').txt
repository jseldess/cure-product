('myself', 'he')

So I find myself at home
The prospects there already

I’ll pull myself another personality type
off the edge of the world

But I can’t let myself treat 
others desires

If I let myself see others desires
where I sleep at times

I let myself treat
In the right sense

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
Face falling off the edge of the face

I was enjoined to act again myself
The South Carolina primary 

But I can’t let myself disregard
Others desires as legitimate

And make myself a visible
higher up in the internet

I’ll pull myself higher up
I’ll get there eventually

I keep turning back again myself
Then the sun isn’t up

off the end myself
The days long aligned

I was enjoying acting against myself
I argued the days were longer

I was bid to act again myself
off the end

myself
the 

without really binding myself
uses for the attention of the brand

myself moved literally as it is
and for which the plan agreed

the least productive of myself
the least instructive of myself

at least instructive of myself
But my not feeling the memory aside

So I found myself at home
the prospects being seen by me
