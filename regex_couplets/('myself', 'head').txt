('myself', 'head')

So I find myself at home
Without a head

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
I brought my head down

I keep turning back again myself
with my head

I was enjoined to act again myself
into the next level head

off the end myself
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

the least productive of myself
