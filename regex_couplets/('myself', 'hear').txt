('myself', 'hear')

So I find myself at home
You can hear it also through your leisure

But I can’t let myself treat 
and my heart rate

I keep turning back again myself
and my heartrate

I was enjoined to act again myself
I hear it between bills and stuff

I’ll pull myself higher up
I can hear it between bills and stuff

myself
In my heart did I lose trust

the least productive of myself
