('myself', 'her')

So I find myself at home
The prospects there already

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I’ll get there eventually

But I can’t let myself treat 
others desires

If I let myself see others desires
where I sleep at times

I let myself treat
There are quarterly goals

I was enjoined to act again myself
here described

But I can’t let myself disregard
Others desires as legitimate

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
I’ll pull my data higher up

And make myself a visible
higher up in the internet

I’ll pull myself higher up
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I keep turning back again myself
Where official policy is to catch and release

off the end myself
there was no promotion

I was bid to act again myself
There was very little physical activity

I was enjoying acting against myself
that potential is there for you

myself
Where in me did I host

the least productive of myself
where I am aside

the least instructive of myself
where I’m watching my tv

at least instructive of myself
where I am aside at least

So I found myself at home
The offers there already
