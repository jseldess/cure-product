('myself', 'here')

So I find myself at home
The prospects there already

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I’ll get there eventually

But I can’t let myself treat 
where I sleep at times

If I let myself see others desires
There are quarterly goals

I was enjoined to act again myself
here described

I let myself treat
That’s where I sleep at times

But I can’t let myself disregard
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I keep turning back again myself
Where official policy is to catch and release

I’ll pull myself higher up
there was no promotion

off the end myself
There was very little physical activity

I was bid to act again myself
that potential is there for you

myself
Where in me did I host

the least productive of myself
where I am aside

the least instructive of myself
where I’m watching my tv

at least instructive of myself
where I am aside at least

So I found myself at home
The offers there already
