('myself', 'hold')

So I find myself at home
I take hold of my finger

I keep turning back again myself
When they really take hold of my finger

I was enjoined to act again myself
Since I had to hold the entire company

off the end myself
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

I was enjoying acting against myself
and hold and wish to hold

myself
