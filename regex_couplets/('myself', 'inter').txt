('myself', 'inter')

So I find myself at home
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

But I can’t let myself treat 
way high up in the inter

I’ll pull myself another personality type
higher up in the internet

I’ll pull myself higher up
high up in the internet

I keep turning back again myself
hold at intervals riding forward

I was enjoined to act again myself
way high up in the internet

off the end myself
Then I saw them interview

myself
my interfaced stand data

So I found myself at home
