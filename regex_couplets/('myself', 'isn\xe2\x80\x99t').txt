('myself', 'isn\xe2\x80\x99t')

So I find myself at home
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

But I can’t let myself treat 
The sun isn’t up

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Then the sun isn’t available

I keep turning back again myself
Then the sun isn’t up

I was enjoined to act again myself
but the sun isn’t up

off the end myself
