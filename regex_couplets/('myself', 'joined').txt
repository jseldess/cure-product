('myself', 'joined')

So I find myself at home
I was enjoined to act again myself

I let myself treat
I was enjoined to act again

Iâ€™ll pull myself higher up
I was enjoined to act

off the end myself
I am enjoined to act again

I was bid to act again myself
I was enjoined to act against

I was enjoying acting against myself
joined in my television

So I found myself at home
