('myself', 'just')

So I find myself at home
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I let myself treat
was not just a defeat

I keep turning back again myself
I just got a letter

I was enjoined to act again myself
it was not just a defeat

myself
