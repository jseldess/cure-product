('myself', 'learn')

So I find myself at home
in light of learning what we see

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
I spend time online learning to code

I keep turning back again myself
learned without too much difficulty to code

I was enjoined to act again myself
decisioned to learn 

the least productive of myself
I learned my location

So I found myself at home
