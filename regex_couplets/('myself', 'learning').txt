('myself', 'learning')

So I find myself at home
in light of learning what we see

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
I spend time online learning to code

I keep turning back again myself
Then I am learning to code

I was enjoined to act again myself
phase decision for learning

the least productive of myself
for learning by the prospect

So I found myself at home
