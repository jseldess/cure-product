('myself', 'let')

So I find myself at home
But I can’t let myself treat 

If I let myself see others desires
I let myself treat

I’ll pull myself another personality type
But I can’t let myself disregard

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
It’s the third letter from the end

I was enjoined to act again myself
I let it remind me again

myself
