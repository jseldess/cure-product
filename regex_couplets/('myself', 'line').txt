('myself', 'line')

So I find myself at home
on the time line I was on

I keep turning back again myself
I spend time online learning to code

I was enjoined to act again myself
On the timeline I was on

Iâ€™ll pull myself higher up
over the time line I was on

off the end myself
The days lined along company

myself
Choose a line

So I found myself at home
