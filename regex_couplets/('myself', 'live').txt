('myself', 'live')

So I find myself at home
Which is a measure to never live out

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I keep turning back again myself
Which is a pleasure to never live out

myself
where I send and relive

the least productive of myself
