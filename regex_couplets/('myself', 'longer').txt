('myself', 'longer')

So I find myself at home
I argued the days felt longer

I was enjoined to act again myself
I argued the days were longer

I was enjoying acting against myself
I agrued the days were longer

off the end myself
I argued that the days were longer

I was bid to act again myself
without longer damage

myself
