('myself', 'man')

So I find myself at home
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

But I can’t let myself treat 
To my children Walt Whitman

I’ll pull myself another personality type
There are performance reviews

I was enjoined to act again myself
not many face up

myself
and that man comes on to tell me 

the least productive of myself
