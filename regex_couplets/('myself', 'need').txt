('myself', 'need')

So I find myself at home
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

If I let myself see others desires
drifting away needs others presume desires

I let myself treat
drifting away needs

I was enjoined to act again myself
I need the work

myself
without really needing

the least productive of myself
in need one in that best own

So I found myself at home
