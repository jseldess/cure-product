('myself', 'night')

So I find myself at home
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I’ll pull myself another personality type
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

But I can’t let myself treat 
blue and sun again a second, then night

I was enjoined to act again myself
I had nightmares though

myself
with dawn already formerly nights 

the least productive of myself
battery dawn nights blending themselves

So I found myself at home
