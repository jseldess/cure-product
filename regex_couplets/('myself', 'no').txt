('myself', 'no')

So I find myself at home
Then I cannot see face value

I’ll pull myself another personality type
On a snow day with my children

But I can’t let myself treat 
But not to impart cynicism

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
and not falling at all

I was enjoined to act again myself
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I let myself treat
Right now I’m the cart

And make myself a visible
by no ventillation my purpose

I keep turning back again myself
In a vertiginous dream

I’ll pull myself higher up
I am told by no ventillation

off the end myself
that their economic value 

I was enjoying acting against myself
there was no promotion

I was bid to act again myself
I take it out in the snow fall

myself
useless for not having paid

without really binding myself
when it is not literal

the least productive of myself
But my not feeling the memory aside

the least instructive of myself
But my not 

So I found myself at home
for a while not to listen
