('myself', 'now')

So I find myself at home
On a snow day with my children

But I can’t let myself treat 
Right now I’m the cart

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
out in the snow

I keep turning back again myself
out in the snow fall

I was enjoined to act again myself
I take it out in the snow fall

myself
who knows the way

the least productive of myself
that their knowing

So I found myself at home
