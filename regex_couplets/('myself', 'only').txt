('myself', 'only')

So I find myself at home
only fragments of time with my children

But I can’t let myself treat 
only in the case

I keep turning back again myself
So that I notice I am the only one

I was enjoined to act again myself
would only willingly break

myself
if only on the way to the trash

So I found myself at home
I only think I don’t listen
