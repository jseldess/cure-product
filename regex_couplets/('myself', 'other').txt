('myself', 'other')

So I find myself at home
I’ll pull myself another personality type

But I can’t let myself treat 
others desires

If I let myself see others desires
drifting away needs others presume desires

I let myself treat
Then I can’t presume to need others

But I can’t let myself disregard
On the other hand

myself
I presume to others

the least productive of myself
Cereal and others’ health

So I found myself at home
I assume possession to others
