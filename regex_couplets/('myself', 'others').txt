('myself', 'others')

So I find myself at home
others desires

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

If I let myself see others desires
drifting away needs others presume desires

I let myself treat
Then I can’t presume to feed others

But I can’t let myself disregard
I presume to others

the least productive of myself
Cereal and others’ health

So I found myself at home
I assume possession to others
