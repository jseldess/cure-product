('myself', 'over')

So I find myself at home
I step over the edge

But I can’t let myself treat 
over the long time up in the sky

I was enjoined to act again myself
over the time line I was on

I keep turning back again myself
hovering above standing water

I’ll pull myself higher up
over the long line up in the sky

off the end myself
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

myself
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
