('myself', 'presume')

So I find myself at home
and can’t presume to need

But I can’t let myself treat 
Then I can’t presume to need others

If I let myself see others desires
drifting away needs others presume desires

I let myself treat
Then I can’t presume to feed others

But I can’t let myself disregard
I continue to presume

myself
I presume to others

the least productive of myself
So I presume the offers already

So I found myself at home
I presume the offers
