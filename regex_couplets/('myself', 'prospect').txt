('myself', 'prospect')

So I find myself at home
The prospects there already

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
the impulse for my own prospects

myself
stopping into the prospect

the least productive of myself
speech that is of by prospects

So I found myself at home
the prospects being seen by me
