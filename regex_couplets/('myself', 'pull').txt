('myself', 'pull')

So I find myself at home
I’ll pull myself another personality type

But I can’t let myself treat 
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

I was enjoined to act again myself
I’ll pull my data higher up

And make myself a visible
I’ll pull my data

I’ll pull myself higher up
fish pulled out of the lake

I keep turning back again myself
