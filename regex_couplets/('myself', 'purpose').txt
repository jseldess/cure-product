('myself', 'purpose')

So I find myself at home
by no ventillation my purpose

I keep turning back again myself
until my purpose up in the sky

I was enjoined to act again myself
until I purpose the horizon

myself
to the other end of my purpose

the least productive of myself
for my own purposes

So I found myself at home
