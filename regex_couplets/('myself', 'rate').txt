('myself', 'rate')

So I find myself at home
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
and my heart rate

I keep turning back again myself
and my heartrate

I was enjoined to act again myself
Strategy comes before morning

off the end myself
I aspirate with little vision

myself
