('myself', 'really')

So I find myself at home
because it was really dark

But I can’t let myself treat 
When they really take hold of my finger

I keep turning back again myself
That’s when they really take

I was enjoined to act again myself
without really agreeing

myself
without really binding myself

myself moved literally as it is
without really binding

the least productive of myself
also didn’t really move

So I found myself at home
