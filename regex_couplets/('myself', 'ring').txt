('myself', 'ring')

So I find myself at home
interferring 

But I can’t let myself treat 
bring your child along

I’ll pull myself another personality type
ring

If I let myself see others desires
hovering above standing water

I was enjoined to act again myself
actually considering the end

myself
firing and connecting somewhere

the least productive of myself
The prospect for veering healthily
