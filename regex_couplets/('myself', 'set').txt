('myself', 'set')

So I find myself at home
upset by Gingrich

I keep turning back again myself
in front of the set afternoon

I was enjoined to act again myself
in front of the set of regulations

off the end myself
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

myself
presets

So I found myself at home
