('myself', 'side')

So I find myself at home
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

But I can’t let myself treat 
aside from the retinas

off the end myself
actually considering the end

myself
by the side of the hosting service

the least productive of myself
But my not feeling the memory aside

the least instructive of myself
where I am aside

at least instructive of myself
where I am aside at least

So I found myself at home
