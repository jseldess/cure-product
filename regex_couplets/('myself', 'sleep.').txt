('myself', 'sleep.')

So I find myself at home
where I sleep at times

But I can’t let myself treat 
That’s where I sleep at times

I let myself treat
Interrupted sleep or

I keep turning back again myself
While I should be sleeping

I was enjoined to act again myself
like flattening sleep 

myself
