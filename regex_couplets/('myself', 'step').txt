('myself', 'step')

So I find myself at home
I step off the edge

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
What the next step

I was enjoined to act again myself
from which to step off

myself
step in by the prospect

the least productive of myself
phase decision step in

So I found myself at home
stepping in the middle
