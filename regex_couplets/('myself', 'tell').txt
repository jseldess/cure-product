('myself', 'tell')

So I find myself at home
Then I constellate my time family country

But I can’t let myself treat 
So I constellate the time family country

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I constellate the time

I keep turning back again myself
The CEO tells me to embody values

I was enjoined to act again myself
I had to tell them the news

myself
and that man comes on to tell me 

the least productive of myself
