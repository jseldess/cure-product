('myself', 'their')

So I find myself at home
We can wrestle them with their goals

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
I am not allowed to see their face

I was enjoined to act again myself
that their economic value 

I was enjoying acting against myself
without their agreement

the least productive of myself
that their knowing

So I found myself at home
