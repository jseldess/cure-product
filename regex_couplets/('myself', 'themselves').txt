('myself', 'themselves')

So I find myself at home
battery dawn nights blending themselves

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
talking into pheasants bending themselves

myself
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

the least productive of myself
battery dawn nights ending themselves

So I found myself at home
