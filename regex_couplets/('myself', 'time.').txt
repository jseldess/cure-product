('myself', 'time.')

So I find myself at home
Then I constellate my time family country

But I can’t let myself treat 
where I sleep at times

If I let myself see others desires
at any time it can drift again

I let myself treat
over the long time up in the sky

I was enjoined to act again myself
That’s where I sleep at times

But I can’t let myself disregard
So I constellate the time family country

I’ll pull myself another personality type
on the time line I was on

I keep turning back again myself
I spend time online learning to code

I’ll pull myself higher up
over the time line I was on

off the end myself
The long time I had a vision

myself
formerly a long time they were on

the least productive of myself
in the long time they were on

So I found myself at home
