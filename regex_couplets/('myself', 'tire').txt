('myself', 'tire')

So I find myself at home
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I was enjoined to act again myself
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

off the end myself
The entire company

I was bid to act again myself
Since I had to hold the entire company

I was enjoying acting against myself
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

myself
