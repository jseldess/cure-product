('myself', 'too.')

So I find myself at home
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

But I can’t let myself treat 
emerging this year from too much standing water

I was enjoined to act again myself
learned without too much difficulty to code

off the end myself
Selma knows too 

the least productive of myself
