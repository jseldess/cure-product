('myself', 'turn')

So I find myself at home
in a sharp downward turn 

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
sudden downward turn

I let myself treat
I keep turning back again myself

I was enjoined to act again myself
who knows how to turn it off

the least productive of myself
I turn not sad exactly

So I found myself at home
