('myself', 'up?')

So I find myself at home
already brought into privacy

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I’ll get there eventually

But I can’t let myself treat 
as a pure product

If I let myself see others desires
as an impure product

I let myself treat
and is relentlessly budgeted

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
value falling off the edge of the face

I was enjoined to act again myself
The South Carolina primary 

But I can’t let myself disregard
Then I cannot see face value

And make myself a visible
and invaluable partner

I’ll pull myself higher up
eventually 

I keep turning back again myself
Then the sun isn’t up

off the end myself
I argued the days were longer

I was enjoying acting against myself
I hear it between bills and stuff

I was bid to act again myself
And as an extension of the values

myself
useless for not having paid

without really binding myself
uses for the attention of the brand

myself moved literally as it is
and literally moved about

the least productive of myself
the least instructive of myself

at least instructive of myself
But my not feeling the memory aside

So I found myself at home
at home brought into private
