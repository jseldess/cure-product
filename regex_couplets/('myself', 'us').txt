('myself', 'us')

So I find myself at home
asynchronous 

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I let myself treat
I want to cite a poem so usual

I keep turning back again myself
In a vertiginous dream

I was enjoined to act again myself
The ventillation rushes on

off the end myself
So stay with us

myself
useless for not having paid

without really binding myself
uses for the attention of the brand

myself moved literally as it is
in the form filled offered in trust

the least productive of myself
radiating from housing

So I found myself at home
