('myself', 'use')

So I find myself at home
because it was really dark

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
You use the most essential parts

I keep turning back again myself
I reuse unassimilable visions

myself
useless for not having paid

without really binding myself
uses for the attention of the brand

myself moved literally as it is
