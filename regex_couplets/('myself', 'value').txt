('myself', 'value')

So I find myself at home
Then I cannot see face value

I’ll pull myself another personality type
value falling off the edge of the face

But I can’t let myself treat 
And as an extension of the values

I was enjoined to act again myself
The value falling off the edge of the face

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
The CEO tells me to embody values

I keep turning back again myself
The value falling off the edge of th face

off the end myself
that their economic value 

I was enjoying acting against myself
As an extension of the values

myself
