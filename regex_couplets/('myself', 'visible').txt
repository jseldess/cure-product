('myself', 'visible')

So I find myself at home
I assumed it was visible

But I can’t let myself treat 
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

I was enjoined to act again myself
And make myself a visible

I’ll pull myself higher up
Divisible or

I keep turning back again myself
I assume the offers divisible

So I found myself at home
that they were divisible
