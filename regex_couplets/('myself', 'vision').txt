('myself', 'vision')

So I find myself at home
I had me a vision

I was enjoined to act again myself
The planning process for visions

off the end myself
aspirating visions

I was bid to act again myself
aspirating with visions

I was enjoying acting against myself
embodied with little visions

myself
there wasnâ€™t any television 

the least productive of myself
joined in my television

So I found myself at home
revisions that can be attributable
