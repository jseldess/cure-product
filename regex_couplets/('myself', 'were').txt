('myself', 'were')

So I find myself at home
When we had jobs that were to earn

I keep turning back again myself
my desires were open

I was enjoined to act again myself
I argued the days were longer

I was enjoying acting against myself
I agrued the days were longer

off the end myself
The days were long

I was bid to act again myself
I argued that the days were longer

myself
formerly a long time they were on

the least productive of myself
I answered about

So I found myself at home
that they were divisible
