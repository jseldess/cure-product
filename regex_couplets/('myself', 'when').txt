('myself', 'When')

So I find myself at home
When I woke up in the morning

But I canâ€™t let myself treat 
When we had jobs that were to earn

I keep turning back again myself
When they really take hold of my finger

I was enjoined to act again myself
When closed to my knowing

myself
When I'm watching my tv 

the least productive of myself
