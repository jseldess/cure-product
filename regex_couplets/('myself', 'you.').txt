('myself', 'you.')

So I find myself at home
Though how can you know without direction

But I can’t let myself treat 
bring your child along

I’ll pull myself another personality type
You can hear it also through your leisure

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
if you have providence to excess

I keep turning back again myself
That you can see only the back of

I was enjoined to act again myself
since you can imagine movement

off the end myself
where you can earn more 

myself
the young ripples inaudibly

So I found myself at home
