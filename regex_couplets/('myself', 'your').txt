('myself', 'your')

So I find myself at home
You can hear it also through your leisure

But I can’t let myself treat 
bring your child along

I’ll pull myself another personality type
May I have your zip code

I keep turning back again myself
your bid to the next highest ranked network

I was enjoined to act again myself
This is your voice 

myself
