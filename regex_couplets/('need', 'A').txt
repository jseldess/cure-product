('need', 'A')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
All of the time

and can’t presume to need
And as an extension of the values

Then I can’t presume to need others
And make myself a visible

I need the work
A defeated

You need history
COPY DREAM 

And need out in front purchase
Articles all around us

where I need gravity
And for an ungraspable time

I tell you where I need gravity
SOCIAL

not needing to wait
CONTRACT

without really needing
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

in need one in that best own
A baby and a bear

need one in best own
Aligned or not with my interests

that in need one best own
All that I own messageable
