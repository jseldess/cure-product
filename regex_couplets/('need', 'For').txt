('need', 'For')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

drifting away needs
Forecasting the story before dawn

I need the work
For an ungraspable time

And need out in front purchase
For an ungraspable purchase

where I need gravity
For Mitt Romney

not needing to wait
Formerly a way like this one

in need one in that best own
For a while I think I don’t listen
