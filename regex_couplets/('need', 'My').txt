('need', 'My')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
My associations

I need the work
My purpose up in the sky

And need out in front purchase
My means without gravity

not needing to wait
My daughter with her way

in need one in that best own
My say to the elections

need one in best own
