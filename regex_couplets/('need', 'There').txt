('need', 'There')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
There are quarterly goals

Then I can’t presume to need others
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I need the work
There are spots waiting

I tell you where I need gravity
There are constant ways

in need one in that best own
