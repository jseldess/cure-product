('need', 'Thou')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Though there are quarters goals

and can’t presume to need
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I need the work
Though in not many acts

I need an explicit statement
Though we are waiting for her

not needing to wait
Though we are waiting 

without really needing
Though we can’t help waiting

in need one in that best own
