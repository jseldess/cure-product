('need', 'To')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
To my children Walt Whitman

and can’t presume to need
To my chidren

drifting away needs
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

I need the work
Toward the start informally given my reasons

You need history
To neither study

not needing to wait
To the ends of transactions

in need one in that best own
To the ends of my transactions

need one in best own
To the right of determined elections

that in need one best own
