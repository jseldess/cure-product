('need', 'We')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
We can wrestle them with their goals

and can’t presume to need
We had to say goodbye there

And need out in front purchase
We had to buy there

where I need gravity
We had inhabited actually

not needing to wait
We ask say in that case

in need one in that best own
