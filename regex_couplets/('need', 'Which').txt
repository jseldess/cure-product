('need', 'Which')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Which is a measure to never live out

and can’t presume to need
Which can be pronounced to the world

I need the work
Which is a pleasure to never live out

which I needed for an explicit state
Which can be called confidence

You need history
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

in need one in that best own
