('need', 'while')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Looking back while I should be sleeping

I need the work
while wrapped in static

I need an explicit statement
while wrapped in explicit static

you need history
while we’re wrapped in static

And need out in front purchase
while consuming damage

where I need gravity
I answered while interfaced

in need one in that best own
for a while to listen already
