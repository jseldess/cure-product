('need', 'agreed')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
and to which I’ve agreed

not needing to wait
and for which the plan agreed

without really needing
that agreed one of rest

in need one in that best own
and to which the plan agreed

need one in best own
that agreed home

that in need one best own
