('need', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
I can’t fix them without direction

and can’t presume to need
But I can’t let myself treat 

Then I can’t presume to need others
Then I can’t presume to feed others

drifting away needs
Then I can’t presume to treat others

I need the work
Though we can’t help waiting

in need one in that best own
I can’t remember them

need one in best own
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
