('need', 'child')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
on a snow day with my children

and can’t presume to need
To my children Walt Whitman

drifting away needs
even my child

And need out in front purchase
Even the children

where I need gravity
my possession of my children

in need one in that best own
speech my possession of my children

need one in best own
