('need', 'drifting')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
drifting does not feel an exception

and can’t presume to need
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

drifting away needs
drifting away from the task

I need the work
