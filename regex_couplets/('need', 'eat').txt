('need', 'eat')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
But I can’t let myself treat 

Then I can’t presume to need others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

drifting away needs
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

drifting away needs others presume desires
I let myself treat

I need the work
it was not just a defeat

You need history
And from that great distance

where I need gravity
And from a great distance

I tell you where I need gravity
was not just a defeat

not needing to wait
burrowed about from repeated travels

without really needing
for the creation of the universe

in need one in that best own
