('need', 'enter')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
The sun high enough to enter directly 

You need history
I enter the flattening mirror

And need out in front purchase
I have entered my purposes

not needing to wait
I have entered my phone

in need one in that best own
I had entered my phone

need one in best own
