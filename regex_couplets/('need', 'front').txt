('need', 'front')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

and can’t presume to need
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

I need the work
And need out in front purchase

where I need gravity
behind or out front or up above

in need one in that best own
