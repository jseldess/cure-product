('need', 'has')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Before anyone has walked across the opening

and can’t presume to need
It has been since

Then I can’t presume to need others
in traversing my purchase

I need the work
purchased out

And need out in front purchase
For an ungraspable purchase

where I need gravity
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I tell you where I need gravity
Is the weight of my purchases

not needing to wait
if that has anything

without really needing
phase decisioned by the prospect

in need one in that best own
phase decisioned

need one in best own
which as tracked befitted phased
