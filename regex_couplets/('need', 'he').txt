('need', 'he')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
All of the time

and can’t presume to need
others desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

drifting away needs
There are quarterly goals

I need the work
up in the television pleasure

I need an explicit statement
up in the television

which I needed for an explicit state
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

You need history
The long time I had a vision

And need out in front purchase
Under the last principle

where I need gravity
they can be waived

I tell you where I need gravity
Is the weight of my purchases

not needing to wait
from cables reheated travels

without really needing
The floor slanted in places

in need one in that best own
speak them of my possessions

need one in best own
stopping into the prospect

that in need one best own
by in the sound privacy
