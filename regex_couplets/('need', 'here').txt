('need', 'here')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Of course there is a direction

and can’t presume to need
where I sleep at times

drifting away needs others presume desires
I’ll get there eventually

drifting away needs
There are quarterly goals

Then I can’t presume to need others
That’s where I sleep at times

I need the work
there was no television to hear

I need an explicit statement
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

which I needed for an explicit state
but where is it

You need history
I get through there

And need out in front purchase
We had to say goodbye there

where I need gravity
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I tell you where I need gravity
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

not needing to wait
where I send and relive

without really needing
Where in me did I host

in need one in that best own
Is there a baby and a bear

need one in best own
By my memory elsewhere

that in need one best own
The prospects there already
