('need', 'if')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
if not directly on my skin

and can’t presume to need
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
at any time it can drift again

drifting away needs
drifting away from the task

I need the work
If I take a different measure

I need an explicit statement
If I take some different measure

which I needed for an explicit state
if there is anything 

not needing to wait
if that has anything

without really needing
if only on the way to the trash
