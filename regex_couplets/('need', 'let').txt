('need', 'let')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
But I can’t let myself treat 

Then I can’t presume to need others
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
I let myself treat

drifting away needs
But I can’t let myself disregard

I need the work
I let it remind me again

where I need gravity
