('need', 'live')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Which is a measure to never live out

and can’t presume to need
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I need the work
Which is a pleasure to never live out

which I needed for an explicit state
where I send and relive aside

not needing to wait
and relive from burrowed travels

without really needing
where I send and relive

in need one in that best own
