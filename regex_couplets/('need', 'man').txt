('need', 'man')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

and can’t presume to need
To my children Walt Whitman

drifting away needs
There are performance reviews

Then I can’t presume to need others
not many face up

I need the work
though not many freeze up

I need an explicit statement
in not many tracks up in the sky

which I needed for an explicit state
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

not needing to wait
and that man comes on to tell me 

in need one in that best own
The many transparent pixel calls

need one in best own
