('need', 'nor')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
into the minority proportion of time

and can’t presume to need
over the long line I would honor

I need the work
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I need an explicit statement
nor work in this way daily

not needing to wait
which had on honor to be told

without really needing
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

in need one in that best own
