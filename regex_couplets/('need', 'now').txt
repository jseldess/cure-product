('need', 'now')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
on a snow day with my children

and can’t presume to need
Right now I’m the cart

drifting away needs
out in the snow

I need the work
even when close to my knowing

And need out in front purchase
knowing the constituents

without really needing
who knows the way

in need one in that best own
who knows how to turn it off

need one in best own
that their knowing

that in need one best own
