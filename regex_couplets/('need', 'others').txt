('need', 'others')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
others desires

and can’t presume to need
Then I can’t presume to need others

drifting away needs others presume desires
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs
Then I can’t presume to feed others

I need the work
I presume to others

in need one in that best own
Cereal and others’ health

need one in best own
I assume possession to others
