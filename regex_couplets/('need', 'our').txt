('need', 'our')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Of course there is a direction

and can’t presume to need
reasons resources

drifting away needs
You can hear it also through your leisure

I need the work
or alter of course the time anyway

not needing to wait
Who throws contours away

in need one in that best own
phrase them of our possessions

need one in best own
