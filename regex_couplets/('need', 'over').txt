('need', 'over')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
I step over the edge

and can’t presume to need
over the long time up in the sky

drifting away needs
over the time line I was on

I need the work
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

You need history
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

And need out in front purchase
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

not needing to wait
for not paying sound overwhelmed

without really needing
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
