('need', 'product')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
as a cure product

and can’t presume to need
as a pure product

Then I can’t presume to need others
as an impure product

drifting away needs others presume desires
an impure product

drifting away needs
the least productive of myself

in need one in that best own
