('need', 'resume')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
and can’t presume to need

Then I can’t presume to need others
drifting away needs others presume desires

drifting away needs
Then I can’t presume to feed others

I need the work
I resume unassimilable visions

I need an explicit statement
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

which I needed for an explicit state
I resume attributable visions

And need out in front purchase
I presume to others

in need one in that best own
So I presume the offers already

need one in best own
I presume the offers
