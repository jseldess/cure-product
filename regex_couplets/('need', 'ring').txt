('need', 'ring')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
interferring 

and can’t presume to need
bring your child along

drifting away needs
ring

Then I can’t presume to need others
hovering above standing water

I need the work
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I need an explicit statement
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

And need out in front purchase
firing and connecting somewhere

without really needing
The prospect for veering healthily
