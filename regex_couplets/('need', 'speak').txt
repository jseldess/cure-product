('need', 'speak')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
not speaking

not needing to wait
would only speak willingly

without really needing
I speak to them my possessions

in need one in that best own
speak them of my possessions

need one in best own
I speak them of my possessions

that in need one best own
