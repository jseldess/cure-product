('need', 'time.')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
only fragments of time with my children

and can’t presume to need
where I sleep at times

drifting away needs others presume desires
at any time it can drift again

drifting away needs
Then I constellate my time family country

I need the work
The long time I had a vision

I need an explicit statement
without the long time I was accounting

which I needed for an explicit state
So I constellate the time family country

You need history
The long time I was a vision

And need out in front purchase
or alter of course the time anyway

not needing to wait
until a happier time found

without really needing
formerly a long time they were on

in need one in that best own
formerly along time they were on

need one in best own
time they were on

that in need one best own
in the long time they were on
