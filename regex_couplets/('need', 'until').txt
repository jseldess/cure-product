('need', 'until')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
until my purpose up in the sky

I need the work
until I could not tire 

I need an explicit statement
until I could not be tired

which I needed for an explicit state
until I could not be hired

And need out in front purchase
until I purpose up in the sky

where I need gravity
until I purchase up the sky

I tell you where I need gravity
until the bill came

not needing to wait
until a happier time found

without really needing
