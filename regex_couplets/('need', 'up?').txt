('need', 'up?')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

and can’t presume to need
But I can’t let myself treat 

Then I can’t presume to need others
as an impure product

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

drifting away needs
There are quarterly goals

I need the work
though not many freeze up

I need an explicit statement
though as for conversing

which I needed for an explicit state
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

You need history
until I could not be tired

And need out in front purchase
For an ungraspable time

where I need gravity
I tell you my purposes

I tell you where I need gravity
Is the weight of my purchases

not needing to wait
and relive from burrowed travels

without really needing
and literally moved about

in need one in that best own
own that stays brought loyal

need one in best own
that stays brought loyal

that in need one best own
by in the sound privacy
