('need', 'us')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

and can’t presume to need
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Then I can’t presume to need others
I want to cite a poem so usual

I need the work
it was not just a defeat

You need history
I have them trust in me

And need out in front purchase
Articles all around us

where I need gravity
I wear suspenders

I tell you where I need gravity
a futile joyous white sun

not needing to wait
useless for not having paid

without really needing
in the form filled offered in trust

in need one in that best own
radiating from housing

need one in best own
