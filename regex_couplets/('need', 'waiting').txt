('need', 'waiting')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
There are spots waiting

I tell you where I need gravity
Though we are waiting for her

not needing to wait
Though we are waiting 

without really needing
Though we can’t help waiting

in need one in that best own
waiting out front or up above 

need one in best own
