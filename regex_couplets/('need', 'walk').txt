('need', 'walk')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

and can’t presume to need
there was no walking along the pleasure

I need the work
I walk up and don’t work anymore

You need history
walking into percents blending themselves

And need out in front purchase
