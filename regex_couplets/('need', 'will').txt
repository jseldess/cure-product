('need', 'will')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

and can’t presume to need
will not be the same

I need the work
that will spur me on

And need out in front purchase
would only willingly break

without really needing
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

in need one in that best own
my daughter will learn 

need one in best own
