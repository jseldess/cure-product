('need', 'you.')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Though how can you know without direction

and can’t presume to need
bring your child along

drifting away needs
You can hear it also through your leisure

I need the work
If you have confidence regardless all else

You need history
a futile joyous white sun

And need out in front purchase
I tell you my purposes

where I need gravity
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I tell you where I need gravity
I tell you the weight of my purposes

not needing to wait
the young ripples inaudibly

in need one in that best own
