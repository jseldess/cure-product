('night', 'A')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

battery dawn nights blending themselves
All of the time

blue and sun again a second, then night
ASPIRATING

I had nightmares though
And as an extension of the values

dawn already formerly nights 
And we could inhabit the room easy

last night
CONTRACT

battery dawn nights 
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
A way I was going

battery dawn nights ending themselves
Aligned or not with my interests
