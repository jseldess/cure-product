('night', 'For')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

blue and sun again a second, then night
For an ungraspable time

dawn already formerly nights 
For Mitt Romney

last night
Formerly a way like this one

battery dawn nights 
Formerly away there are constant ways

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

nights
Forty-one seconds in

battery dawn nights blending themselves
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
