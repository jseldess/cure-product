('night', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
I’m simply inside

blue and sun again a second, then night
where I’m watching my tv

battery dawn nights blending themselves
