('night', 'IN')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

blue and sun again a second, then night
ASPIRATING

I had nightmares though
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

dawn already formerly nights 
By NATASHA SINGER

last night
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

battery dawn nights 
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
