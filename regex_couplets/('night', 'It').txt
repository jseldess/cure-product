('night', 'It')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

battery dawn nights blending themselves
It keeps coming down thankfully

blue and sun again a second, then night
It’s not marshal exactly

battery dawn nights 
It’s not marshall exactly

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
