('night', 'so')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

battery dawn nights blending themselves
When I want something

blue and sun again a second, then night
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I had nightmares though
with little reason to move

dawn already formerly nights 
I want to cite a poem so usual

last night
for not paying sound overwhelmed

with dawn already formerly nights 
so still watch them

battery dawn nights 
by in the sound privacy

battery dawn nights ending themselves
buy in the sound privacy
