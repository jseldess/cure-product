('night', 'That')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them

blue and sun again a second, then night
That you can see only the back of

I had nightmares though
That company creates a life

battery dawn nights blending themselves
That I captured an afterimage

dawn already formerly nights 
That are my right to say
