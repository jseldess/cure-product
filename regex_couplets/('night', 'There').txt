('night', 'There')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

blue and sun again a second, then night
There was very little physical activity

I had nightmares though
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

battery dawn nights blending themselves
There are spots waiting

dawn already formerly nights 
There are constant ways

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
There are no constant waves

battery dawn nights
