('night', 'Thou')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Though there are quarters goals

blue and sun again a second, then night
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Though we are waiting for her

dawn already formerly nights 
Though we are breaking 

last night
Though we are waiting 

with dawn already formerly nights 
Though we can’t help waiting

battery dawn nights
