('night', 'though')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
As though stationary and a destination

blue and sun again a second, then night
I had nightmares though

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I thought

dawn already formerly nights 
though it was most emphatically that

last night
after though thereâ€™s no memory

battery dawn nights 
I answered what I thought

battery dawn nights ending themselves
I answered what I thought about

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
