('night', 'To')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
To my children Walt Whitman

blue and sun again a second, then night
Tomorrow

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

last night
To the ends of transactions

dawn already formerly nights 
To the ends of my transactions

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
To the other end of transactions

battery dawn nights 
To the right of determined elections
