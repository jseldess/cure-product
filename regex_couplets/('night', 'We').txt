('night', 'We')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
We can wrestle them with their goals

blue and sun again a second, then night
We had to say goodbye there

dawn already formerly nights 
We had inhabited actually

last night
We ask say in that case
