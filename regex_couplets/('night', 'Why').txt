('night', 'Why')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

blue and sun again a second, then night
