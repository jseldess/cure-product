('night', 'about')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

battery dawn nights blending themselves
about my childrenâ€™s consumption

blue and sun again a second, then night
burrowed about from repeated travels

last night
and literally moved about

with dawn already formerly nights 
answered about 

dawn already formerly nights 
I answered about

battery dawn nights ending themselves
I answered what I thought about

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
about
