('night', 'across')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Before we walk across the wide field

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Before we walk across the wide opening

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

blue and sun again a second, then night
across the retinas

I had nightmares though
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

dawn already formerly nights 
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
