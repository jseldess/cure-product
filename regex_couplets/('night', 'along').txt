('night', 'along')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
bring your child along

blue and sun again a second, then night
The days lined along company

battery dawn nights blending themselves
formerly along time they were on

battery dawn nights 
formerly along my say to the elections

battery dawn nights ending themselves
shone formerly along time

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
drawn formerly along
