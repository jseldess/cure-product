('night', 'any')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

blue and sun again a second, then night
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I had nightmares though
The days aligned for company

dawn already formerly nights 
if there is anything 

last night
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

with dawn already formerly nights 
if that has anything

battery dawn nights 
The many transparent pixel calls

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
or imagined anyway
