('night', 'away')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
drifting away

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
drifting away needs others presume desires

blue and sun again a second, then night
Who throws contours away

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
Formerly away there are constant ways

battery dawn nights 
formerly away

battery dawn nights blending themselves
