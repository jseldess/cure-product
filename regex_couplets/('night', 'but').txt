('night', 'but')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
but not impart cynicism

blue and sun again a second, then night
but it continued

I had nightmares though
but it continued rippling muscle

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I resume attributable visions

dawn already formerly nights 
that decisions can be attributable

battery dawn nights 
but for memory elsewhere

battery dawn nights ending themselves
but standing in memory

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
decisions that can be attributable
