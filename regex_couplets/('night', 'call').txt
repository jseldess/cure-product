('night', 'call')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
not calling or echoing for once

battery dawn nights blending themselves
though it was most emphatically that

blue and sun again a second, then night
They are called aspirational

I had nightmares though
Which can be called confidence

dawn already formerly nights 
to take the call

last night
The many transparent pixel calls

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
recalling aside

battery dawn nights ending themselves
