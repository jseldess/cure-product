('night', 'child')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
On a snow day with my children

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
as pure as my children

battery dawn nights blending themselves
about my children’s consumption

blue and sun again a second, then night
even my child

dawn already formerly nights 
my possession of my children

battery dawn nights 
speech my possession of my children

battery dawn nights ending themselves
