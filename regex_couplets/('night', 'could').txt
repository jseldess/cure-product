('night', 'could')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
and could be mapped and weighed

blue and sun again a second, then night
until I could not tire 

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I could in effect credit

dawn already formerly nights 
And we could inhabit the room easy

last night
and could be inflected with reasons
