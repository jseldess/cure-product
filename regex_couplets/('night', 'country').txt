('night', 'country')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Then I constellate my time family country

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
So I constellate the time family country

blue and sun again a second, then night
around my country 

battery dawn nights blending themselves
More reasons around my country 

last night
