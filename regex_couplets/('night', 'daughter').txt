('night', 'daughter')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I love my daughter still

battery dawn nights blending themselves
with my daughter

dawn already formerly nights 
my daughter will learn 

battery dawn nights 
my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me

battery dawn nights ending themselves
