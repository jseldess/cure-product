('night', 'day')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
On a snow day with my children

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
One day there is direction

blue and sun again a second, then night
I argued the days felt longer

I had nightmares though
The days long aligned

battery dawn nights blending themselves
The day

dawn already formerly nights 
I have a memory between the day

last night
at least most days

battery dawn nights ending themselves
