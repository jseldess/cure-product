('night', 'do')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
in a sharp downward turn 

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In a sharp downard turn

blue and sun again a second, then night
What I do in my liesure

dawn already formerly nights 
and it doesn’t take long

last night
latency which doesn’t mean anything

with dawn already formerly nights 
I only think I don’t listen
