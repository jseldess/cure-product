('night', 'eat')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
too sunny to eat ice cream

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I reach repeated expressions first

blue and sun again a second, then night
of the habits I create

I had nightmares though
That company creates a life

dawn already formerly nights 
was not just a defeat

last night
for the creation of the universe

battery dawn nights ending themselves
