('night', 'edge')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
off the edge of the world

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
I step off the edge

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Face falling off the edge of the face

blue and sun again a second, then night
and testing the edge and gravity

I had nightmares though
