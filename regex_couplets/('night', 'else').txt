('night', 'else')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
If you have confidence regardless all else

blue and sun again a second, then night
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

dawn already formerly nights 
and elsewhere my memory

last night
elsewhere by my memory

battery dawn nights blending themselves
By my memory elsewhere

battery dawn nights 
in memory elsewhere

battery dawn nights ending themselves
but for memory elsewhere

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
