('night', 'feeling')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
conversations with our feelings

blue and sun again a second, then night
But my not feeling the memory aside

last night
But my not feeling the memory inside

battery dawn nights 
By my feeling the memory inside

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
But my feeling the memory aside

battery dawn nights blending themselves
