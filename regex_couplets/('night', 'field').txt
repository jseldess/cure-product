('night', 'field')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Before we walk across the wide field

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
stopped light with validated variegated fields

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Before anyone has walked across the field

blue and sun again a second, then night
stopped light with validated fields

dawn already formerly nights
