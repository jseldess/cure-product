('night', 'get')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll get there eventually

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
and is relentlessly budgeted

blue and sun again a second, then night
I get through there

dawn already formerly nights 
forgetting decisions 

battery dawn nights blending themselves
forgettable
