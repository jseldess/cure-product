('night', 'going')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

battery dawn nights blending themselves
The way that she is going

last night
The way that I am going

battery dawn nights 
the way that I was going

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
way I was going 

battery dawn nights ending themselves
