('night', 'Having')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Having transitioned from leisure to work

blue and sun again a second, then night
Having been purchased out of you

dawn already formerly nights 
Having seen more than 

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Having seen more than I can remember
