('night', 'he')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light

blue and sun again a second, then night
The planning process for visions

I had nightmares though
that I was the arm of this

dawn already formerly nights 
formerly a long time they were on

last night
all parties would be held

with the latency last night
knowing the constituents

with dawn already formerly nights 
I speak to them my possessions

battery dawn nights 
But my not feeling the memory inside

nights
the other end transactions

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
who knows the way

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in memory elsewhere

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

dawn formerly nights ended themselves
drawn formerly rights blended themselves
