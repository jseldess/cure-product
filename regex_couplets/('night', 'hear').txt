('night', 'hear')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
You can hear it also through your leisure

blue and sun again a second, then night
I hear it between bills and stuff

I had nightmares though
I can hear it between bills and stuff

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In my heart did I lose trust

dawn already formerly nights
