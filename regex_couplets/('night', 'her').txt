('night', 'her')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
I told her a story, she drew waves.

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Of course there is a direction

blue and sun again a second, then night
there was no promotion

I had nightmares though
There was very little physical activity

dawn already formerly nights 
if there is anything 

last night
Where in me did I host

with dawn already formerly nights 
Though we are waiting for her

battery dawn nights 
to the other end of actions

nights
the other end transactions

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
to their other end

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in memory elsewhere

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
where rights ended themselves
