('night', 'here')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll get there eventually

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Of course there is a direction

blue and sun again a second, then night
there was no promotion

I had nightmares though
There was very little physical activity

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I get through there

dawn already formerly nights 
if there is anything 

last night
Where in me did I host

with dawn already formerly nights 
Elsewhere by my memory

battery dawn nights 
There are constant ways

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
There are no constant waves

nights
where rights ended themselves

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in memory elsewhere

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
where lights blended themselves
