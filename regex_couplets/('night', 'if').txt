('night', 'if')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
drifting away

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
if not directly on my skin

blue and sun again a second, then night
That company creates a life

battery dawn nights blending themselves
If I take a different measure

dawn already formerly nights 
if there is anything 

last night
if that has anything

with dawn already formerly nights 
if only on the way to the trash
