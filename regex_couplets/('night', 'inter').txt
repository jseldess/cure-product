('night', 'inter')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

battery dawn nights blending themselves
interjecting on a day ambition

blue and sun again a second, then night
with internally regulated climate

I had nightmares though
Then I saw them interview

dawn already formerly nights 
my interfaced stand data

battery dawn nights ending themselves
I interfaced

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
 as points which are my interest
