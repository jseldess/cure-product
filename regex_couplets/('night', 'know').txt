('night', 'know')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
who knows the way

battery dawn nights blending themselves
how can I know without direction

blue and sun again a second, then night
I even know what I would find

dawn already formerly nights 
knowing the constituents

with dawn already formerly nights 
who knows how to turn it off

battery dawn nights 
who know the ways to their other end

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
that their knowing
