('night', 'light')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
variegated reflected light

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light

blue and sun again a second, then night
stopped light with validated fields

dawn already formerly nights 
where lights blended themselves

battery dawn nights ending themselves
