('night', 'live')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Which is a measure to never live out

blue and sun again a second, then night
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Which is a pleasure to never live out

last night
where I send and relive

battery dawn nights ending themselves
