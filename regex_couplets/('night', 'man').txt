('night', 'man')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

blue and sun again a second, then night
not many face up

battery dawn nights blending themselves
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

dawn already formerly nights 
They have very many choices

last night
and that man comes on to tell me 

battery dawn nights 
The many transparent pixel calls

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
