('night', 'mean')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
What does it mean to drift

blue and sun again a second, then night
My means without gravity

dawn already formerly nights 
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

with dawn already formerly nights 
The other end of means

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
To the other end of means like this one

battery dawn nights
