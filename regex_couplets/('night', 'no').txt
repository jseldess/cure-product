('night', 'no')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
asynchronous 

battery dawn nights blending themselves
and not falling at all

blue and sun again a second, then night
upsent in the afternoon

I had nightmares though
there was no promotion

dawn already formerly nights 
The sun high enough to enter directly

last night
knowing the constituents

with dawn already formerly nights 
and it’s not literal

battery dawn nights 
But my not feeling the memory inside

nights
It’s not marshall exactly

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
who knows the way

battery dawn nights ending themselves
between cereal and economic
