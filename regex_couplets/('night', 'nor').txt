('night', 'nor')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
into the minority proportion of time

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
over the long line I would honor

blue and sun again a second, then night
the simple act of honoring an accountant

battery dawn nights blending themselves
nor work in this way daily

last night
which had on honor to be told

with dawn already formerly nights 
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

battery dawn nights ending themselves
