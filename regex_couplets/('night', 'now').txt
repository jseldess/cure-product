('night', 'now')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
On a snow day with my children

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
who knows the way

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

blue and sun again a second, then night
out in the snow

I had nightmares though
I take it out in the snow fall

dawn already formerly nights 
knowing the constituents

with dawn already formerly nights 
who knows how to turn it off

battery dawn nights 
who know the ways to their other end

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
that their knowing
