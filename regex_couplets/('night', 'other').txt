('night', 'other')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
others desires

blue and sun again a second, then night
On the other hand

battery dawn nights blending themselves
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

dawn already formerly nights 
and other types of tracking technology

last night
I presume to others

battery dawn nights 
to the other end of actions

nights
the other end transactions

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
to their other end

battery dawn nights ending themselves
Cereal and others’ health
