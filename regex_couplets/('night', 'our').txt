('night', 'our')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
reasons resources

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
conversations with our purchase

blue and sun again a second, then night
with four key value pairs

I had nightmares though
You can hear it also through your leisure

battery dawn nights blending themselves
or alter of course the time anyway

dawn already formerly nights 
This is your voice 

last night
Who throws contours away

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
The contours exchange with you

battery dawn nights 
phrase them of our possessions
