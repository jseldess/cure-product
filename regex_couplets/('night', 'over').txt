('night', 'over')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I step over the edge

blue and sun again a second, then night
oddly grown over with historic bark

I had nightmares though
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

battery dawn nights blending themselves
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

dawn already formerly nights 
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

last night
for not paying sound overwhelmed

with dawn already formerly nights 
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
