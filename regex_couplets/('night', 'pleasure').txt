('night', 'pleasure')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Which is a pleasure to never live out

blue and sun again a second, then night
there was no walking along the pleasure

dawn already formerly nights
