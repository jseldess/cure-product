('night', 'possession')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I speak to them my possessions

with dawn already formerly nights 
my possession of my children

dawn already formerly nights 
I speak them of my possessions

battery dawn nights 
speech my possession of my children

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I stay the right of my possessions
