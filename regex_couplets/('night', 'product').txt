('night', 'product')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
an impure product

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
What is an impure product

battery dawn nights blending themselves
as a cure product

blue and sun again a second, then night
the least productive of myself

battery dawn nights ending themselves
