('night', 'really')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
because it was really dark

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
it was really sunny

battery dawn nights blending themselves
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

blue and sun again a second, then night
without really agreeing

last night
without really branding 

with dawn already formerly nights 
without really needing

dawn already formerly nights 
also didn’t really move

battery dawn nights ending themselves
