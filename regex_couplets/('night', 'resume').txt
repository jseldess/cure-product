('night', 'resume')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
and canâ€™t presume to need

blue and sun again a second, then night
I resume unassimilable visions

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I resume attributable visions

dawn already formerly nights 
I presume to others

battery dawn nights 
So I presume the offers already
