('night', 'side')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I’m simply inside

blue and sun again a second, then night
aside from the retinas

I had nightmares though
actually considering the end

dawn already formerly nights 
But my not feeling the memory aside

last night
by the side of the hosting service

battery dawn nights 
But my not feeling the memory inside

nights
By my feeling the memory inside

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
44 seconds inside

battery dawn nights ending themselves
