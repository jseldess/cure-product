('night', 'sleep')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
where I sleep at times

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

battery dawn nights blending themselves
That’s where I sleep at times

blue and sun again a second, then night
like flattening sleep 

dawn already formerly nights
