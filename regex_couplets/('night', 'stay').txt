('night', 'stay')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
wrestling to stay still

blue and sun again a second, then night
So stay with us

battery dawn nights blending themselves
own stays brought loyal

dawn already formerly nights 
own that stays brought loyal

battery dawn nights 
that stays brought loyal

battery dawn nights ending themselves
I stay the right of my elections
