('night', 'step')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I step off the edge

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
I step over the edge

blue and sun again a second, then night
What the next step

I had nightmares though
from which to step off

battery dawn nights blending themselves
step in by the prospect

battery dawn nights 
phase decision step in

battery dawn nights ending themselves
step by into the prospect
