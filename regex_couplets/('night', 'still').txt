('night', 'still')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

battery dawn nights blending themselves
That is itself not still

blue and sun again a second, then night
I love my daughter still

dawn already formerly nights 
though we are still breaking in

last night
still wash conserving

battery dawn nights
