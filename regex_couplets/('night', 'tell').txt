('night', 'tell')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Then I constellate my time family country

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
So I constellate the time family country

blue and sun again a second, then night
I had to tell them the news

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I tell you my purposes

dawn already formerly nights 
and that man comes on to tell me 

battery dawn nights
