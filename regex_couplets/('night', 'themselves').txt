Then blue and sun again a second, then night
battery dawn nights blending themselves

blue and sun again a second, then night
talking into pheasants bending themselves

dawn already formerly nights 
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

last night
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

battery dawn nights ending themselves
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

dawn formerly nights ended themselves
drawn formerly rights blended themselves
