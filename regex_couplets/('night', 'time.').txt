('night', 'time.')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Then I constellate my time family country

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

battery dawn nights blending themselves
only fragments of time with my children

blue and sun again a second, then night
The long time I had a vision

dawn already formerly nights 
formerly a long time they were on

last night
until a happier time found

with dawn already formerly nights 
formerly along time they were on

battery dawn nights 
time they were on

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in the long time they were on

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
formerly along the time they were on
