('night', 'tire')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I had nightmares though
until I could not tire 

battery dawn nights blending themselves
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

dawn already formerly nights
