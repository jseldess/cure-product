('night', 'too')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
too sunny to eat ice cream

battery dawn nights blending themselves
emerging this year from too much standing water

blue and sun again a second, then night
Selma knows too 

battery dawn nights
