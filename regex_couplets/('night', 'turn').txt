('night', 'turn')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
in a sharp downward turn 

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
In a sharp downard turn

blue and sun again a second, then night
who knows how to turn it off

battery dawn nights 
I turn not sad exactly

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I return not sad exactly
