('night', 'until')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
until my purpose up in the sky

blue and sun again a second, then night
until I could not tire 

battery dawn nights blending themselves
until I purpose up in the sky

dawn already formerly nights 
until a happier time found

with dawn already formerly nights
