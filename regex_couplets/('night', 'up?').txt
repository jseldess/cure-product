('night', 'up?')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In a sharp downard turn

blue and sun again a second, then night
upsent in the afternoon

I had nightmares though
I am full of potential

dawn already formerly nights 
without really agreeing

last night
all parties would be held

with the latency last night
would only willingly speak

with a latency last night
constituents

with dawn already formerly nights 
Though we are waiting for her

battery dawn nights 
I end up in Bach

nights
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
The contours exchange with you

battery dawn nights ending themselves
radiating from housing

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
I thought
