('night', 'us')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
asynchronous 

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
because it was really dark

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

blue and sun again a second, then night
So stay with us

dawn already formerly nights 
I want to cite a poem so usual

last night
useless for not having paid

with dawn already formerly nights 
in the form filled offered in trust

battery dawn nights 
radiating from housing

battery dawn nights ending themselves
I have them trust in me
