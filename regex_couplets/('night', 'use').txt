('night', 'use')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
because it was really dark

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
You use the most essential parts

blue and sun again a second, then night
I reuse unassimilable visions

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I used my technology

dawn already formerly nights 
trackers collecting data on users

last night
useless for not having paid

with dawn already formerly nights
