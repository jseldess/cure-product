('night', 'wait')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
There are spots waiting

dawn already formerly nights 
Though we are waiting for her

last night
Though we are waiting 

with dawn already formerly nights 
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

battery dawn nights 
not needing to wait

battery dawn nights blending themselves
waiting out front or up above
