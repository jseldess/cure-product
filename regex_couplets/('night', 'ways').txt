('night', 'ways')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

battery dawn nights blending themselves
always watching

dawn already formerly nights 
deep into pathways from repeated travels

last night
with constant ways 

battery dawn nights 
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

nights
There are constant ways

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
with no constant ways 

battery dawn nights ending themselves
