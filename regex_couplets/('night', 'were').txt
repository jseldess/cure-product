('night', 'were')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
When we had jobs that were to earn

blue and sun again a second, then night
I argued the days were longer

I had nightmares though
The days were long

battery dawn nights blending themselves
they were on

dawn already formerly nights 
formerly a long time they were on

last night
answered about 

battery dawn nights 
I answered what I thought

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in the long time they were on

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
time they were on
