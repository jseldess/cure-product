('night', 'When')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
When I woke up in the morning

battery dawn nights blending themselves
When I want something

blue and sun again a second, then night
When closed to my knowing

dawn already formerly nights 
When I'm watching my tv 

battery dawn nights
