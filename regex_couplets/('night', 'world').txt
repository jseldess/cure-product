('night', 'world')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
off the edge of the world

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Which can be pronounced to the world

blue and sun again a second, then night
off the end of the world

I had nightmares though
hauling off the end of the world

battery dawn nights blending themselves
the opinions in my world

with dawn already formerly nights
