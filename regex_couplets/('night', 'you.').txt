('night', 'you.')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Though how can you know without direction

blue and sun again a second, then night
That you can see only the back of

I had nightmares though
since you can imagine movement

battery dawn nights blending themselves
a futile joyous white sun

dawn already formerly nights 
You can hear it also through your leisure

last night
the young ripples inaudibly
