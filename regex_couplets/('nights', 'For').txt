('nights', 'For')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

dawn already formerly nights 
For Mitt Romney

with dawn already formerly nights 
Formerly a way like this one

battery dawn nights 
Formerly away there are constant ways

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

nights
Forty-one seconds in

battery dawn nights ending themselves
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
