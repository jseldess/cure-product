('nights', 'There')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

dawn already formerly nights 
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

with dawn already formerly nights 
There are constant ways

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
There are no constant waves

battery dawn nights
