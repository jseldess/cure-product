('nights', 'To')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
To my children Walt Whitman

dawn already formerly nights 
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

with dawn already formerly nights 
To the ends of transactions

battery dawn nights 
To the ends of my transactions

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
To the other end of transactions

nights
To the right of determined elections
