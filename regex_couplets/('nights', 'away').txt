('nights', 'away')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
drifting away needs others presume desires

dawn already formerly nights 
Who throws contours away

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
Formerly away there are constant ways

battery dawn nights 
formerly away

battery dawn nights ending themselves
