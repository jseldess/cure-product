('nights', 'going')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

dawn already formerly nights 
The way that she is going

with dawn already formerly nights 
The way that I am going

battery dawn nights 
the way that I was going

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
way I was going 

battery dawn nights ending themselves
