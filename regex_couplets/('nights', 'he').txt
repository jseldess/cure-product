('nights', 'he')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light

dawn already formerly nights 
formerly a long time they were on

with dawn already formerly nights 
I speak to them my possessions

battery dawn nights 
But my not feeling the memory inside

nights
the other end transactions

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
who knows the way

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in memory elsewhere

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

dawn formerly nights ended themselves
drawn formerly rights blended themselves
