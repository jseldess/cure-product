('nights', 'here')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Of course there is a direction

dawn already formerly nights 
if there is anything 

with dawn already formerly nights 
Where in me did I host

battery dawn nights 
There are constant ways

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
There are no constant waves

nights
where rights ended themselves

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in memory elsewhere

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
where lights blended themselves
