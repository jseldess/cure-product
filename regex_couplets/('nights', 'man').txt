('nights', 'man')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

dawn already formerly nights 
They have very many choices

with dawn already formerly nights 
and that man comes on to tell me 

battery dawn nights 
The many transparent pixel calls

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
