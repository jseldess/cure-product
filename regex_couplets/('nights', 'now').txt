('nights', 'now')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
on a snow day with my children

dawn already formerly nights 
knowing the constituents

with dawn already formerly nights 
who knows the way

battery dawn nights 
who know the ways to their other end

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
that their knowing
