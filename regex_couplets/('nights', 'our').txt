('nights', 'our')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
conversations with our purchase

dawn already formerly nights 
Or alter of course the time anyway

with dawn already formerly nights 
Who throws contours away

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
The contours exchange with you

battery dawn nights 
phrase them of our possessions
