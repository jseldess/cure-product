('nights', 'time.')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
only fragments of time with my children

dawn already formerly nights 
formerly a long time they were on

with dawn already formerly nights 
formerly along time they were on

battery dawn nights 
time they were on

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in the long time they were on

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
formerly along the time they were on
