('nights', 'up?')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In a sharp downard turn

dawn already formerly nights 
without really agreeing

with dawn already formerly nights 
Though we are waiting for her

battery dawn nights 
I end up in Bach

nights
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

I end up in Bach battery dawn nights
The contours exchange with you

battery dawn nights ending themselves
radiating from housing

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
I thought
