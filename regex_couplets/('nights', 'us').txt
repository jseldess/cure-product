('nights', 'us')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

dawn already formerly nights 
I want to cite a poem so usual

with dawn already formerly nights 
in the form filled offered in trust

battery dawn nights 
radiating from housing

battery dawn nights ending themselves
I have them trust in me
