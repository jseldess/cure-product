('no', 'Bach')

into the minority proportion of time
I end up in Bach 

But my not feeling the memory inside
I end up in Bach and Selma

It’s not marshal exactly
I end up Bach

who knows how to turn it off
Bach helps turn it off

It’s not marshall exactly
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

who knows the way
and end up in Bach

There are no constant ways
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

I end up in Bach with no way 
on Bach

not literally moved about
