('no', 'For')

into the minority proportion of time
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

But not to impart cynicism
For whom drifting is not an exception

the drifting is not something special
Forecasting the story before dawn

I’ll pull myself another personality type
For an ungraspable time

I used my technology
For Mitt Romney

nor work in this way daily
For my own purchases

But my not feeling the memory aside
Formerly a way like this one

It’s not marshal exactly
Formerly away there are constant ways

who knows the way
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

But my not feeling the memory inside
Forty-one seconds in

I end up in Bach with no way 
For a while I think I don’t listen

traffick is there nonetheless
