('no', 'IN')

into the minority proportion of time
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

Then I cannot see face value
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

out in the snow
THE PLANNING PROCESS

I am told by no ventillation
UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON

of my economic value
ASPIRATING

an upsent afternoon
ASPIRATING VISIONS

and strategies not tactics
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
By NATASHA SINGER

not speaking
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

But my not feeling the memory inside
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

It’s not marshal exactly
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

I end up in Bach with no way
