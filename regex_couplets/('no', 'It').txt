('no', 'It')

into the minority proportion of time
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

asynchronous 
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

on a snow day with my children
It keeps coming down thankfully

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
It has been since

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
It’s morning 

Then I cannot see face value
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

upsent in the afternoon
It’s not marshal exactly

who knows how to turn it off
It’s not marshall exactly

with no way
