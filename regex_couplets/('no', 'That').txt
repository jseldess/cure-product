('no', 'That')

into the minority proportion of time
That’s exaclty what I want for them

if not directly on my skin
That is itself not still

not rotating
That’s where I sleep at times

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
That’s when they really take

in a continuous vertiginous dream
That you can see only the back of

an upsent afternoon
That can’t be glimpsed

in front of the set afternoon
That company creates a life

there was no promotion
That I captured an afterimage

so that nothing had gravity
That are my right to say

between cereal and economic
