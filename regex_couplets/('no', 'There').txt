('no', 'There')

into the minority proportion of time
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

if not directly on my skin
There are quarterly goals

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Which can be pronounced to the world
There was very little physical activity

there was no promotion
There are spots waiting

that nothing had gravity
There are constant ways

who knows the way
There are no constant waves

There are no constant ways
