('no', 'Thou')

into the minority proportion of time
Though there are quarters goals

They’re just not mine
Though how can you know without direction

or not even rotating
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I take it out in the snow fall
Though in not many acts

Though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

Though it is not many simple acts
Though it is not a simple act

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Though we are waiting for her

The sun high enough to enter directly
Though we are breaking 

But my not feeling the memory aside
Though we are waiting 

and it’s not literal
Though we can’t help waiting

But my not feeling the memory inside
