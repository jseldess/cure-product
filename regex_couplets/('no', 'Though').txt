('no', 'though')

into the minority proportion of time
As though stationary and a destination

not rotating
though there are quarters with goals

They’re just not mine
though it was most emphatically that

not one virtue to excess
I had nightmares though

there was no promotion
though not many freeze up

though not many face up
though not many facts up in the sky

until I could not tire 
though as for conversing

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
though in not many acts up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
though it is not a simple act

the simple act of honoring an accountant
I thought

The sun high enough to enter directly
though we are still breaking in

not speaking
I though

But my not feeling the memory aside
after though there’s no memory

But my not feeling the memory inside
I answered what I thought

who knows the way
I answered what I thought about

between cereal and economic
