('no', 'To')

into the minority proportion of time
To my children Walt Whitman

does not feel an exception
To my chidren

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
To my children

But not to impart cynicism
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
To neither study

nor work in this way daily
To that impossible place

Then I cannot see face value
Tomorrow

out in the snow
Toward the start informally given my reasons

until I could not be tired
To substitute neither study

nor envy honest work
To the ends of transactions

But my not feeling the memory inside
To the ends of my transactions

Itâ€™s not marshall exactly
To the other end of transactions

There are no constant ways
To the other end of my actions

with no way
To the other end of transactions like this

I end up in Bach with no way 
To the right of determined elections

Aligned or not with my interests
