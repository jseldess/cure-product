on a snow day with my children
in light of learning what we see

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
That’s exaclty what I want for them

if not directly on my skin
what I find there

slow asynchronous
I invited most of what came next

there was no promotion
I even know what I would find

what literally moved

who knows the way
In what part did I lose trust

But my not feeling the memory inside
I answered what I thought

not literally moved about
I answered what I thought about

between cereal and economic
to return what I bought

I returned not sad exactly
