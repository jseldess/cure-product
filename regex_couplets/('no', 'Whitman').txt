('no', 'Whitman')

into the minority proportion of time
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

on a snow day with my children
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

does not feel an exception
To my children Walt Whitman

drifting does not feel an exception
Walt Whitman

But not to impart cynicism
What Whitman

the drifting is not something special
Walt Whitman drifted

Then I cannot see face value
