('no', 'You')

into the minority proportion of time
You should ask who I am

Then I cannot see face value
You can hear it also through your leisure

But not to impart cynicism
You use the most essential parts

in a continuous vertiginous dream
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
You can clear it also through static seizure

the simple act of honoring an accountant
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

until I could not tire
You can hear it also through static leisure

until I could not be tired
You need history

until I could not be hired
You can have seen offering

in that I cannot remember
