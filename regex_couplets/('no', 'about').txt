('no', 'about')

into the minority proportion of time
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

on a snow day with my children
about my children’s consumption

Then I cannot see face value
burrowed about from repeated travels

But my not feeling the memory aside
and literally moved about

when it is not literal
answered about 

who knows the way
I answered about

not literally moved about
washed I answered about

after though there’s no memory
which I feel formerly about for

But my not feeling the memory inside
I answered what I thought about

between cereal and economic
about 

Aligned or not with my interests
