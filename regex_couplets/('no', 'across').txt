('no', 'across')

into the minority proportion of time
Before we walk across the wide field

asynchronous 
Before we walk across the wide opening

who knows the way
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

on a snow day with my children
Before anyone walks across the opening

if not directly on my skin
Before anyone has walked across the opening

of not directly from my skin
across the retinas

there was no promotion
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

it was not just a defeat
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

in that I cannot remember
