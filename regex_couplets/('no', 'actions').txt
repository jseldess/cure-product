('no', 'actions')

into the minority proportion of time
conversations with our reactions

on a snow day with my children
to the ends of my transactions

The sun high enough to enter directly
The ends of my transactions

But my not feeling the memory inside
To the ends of transactions

It’s not marshal exactly
the other end transactions

who knows how to turn it off
to the other end of actions

It’s not marshall exactly
of my actions

who knows the way
The other ends of my transactions

There are no constant ways
The other end of my transactions

with no way
the other end of actions

I end up in Bach with no way 
to the other end of transactions

and have no way
