('no', 'agreed')

into the minority proportion of time
and to which I’ve agreed

The sun high enough to enter directly
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

But my not feeling the memory aside
and for which the plan agreed

when it is not literal
that agreed one of rest

and it’s not literal
that agreed home

in that I cannot remember 
that agreed to one the people

for a while not to listen
