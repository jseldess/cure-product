('no', 'along')

into the minority proportion of time
bring your child along

the drifting is not something special
The days lined along company

there was no promotion
there was no walking along the pleasure

there was no walking along
no solid ground to continue along

because there was no solid ground to continue along
walking along the measure

I take it out in the snow fall
formerly along time they were on

But my not feeling the memory inside
formerly along my say to the elections

who knows the way
along cables

But my not feeling the memory aside
mostly along cables

But my not 
shone formerly along time

between cereal and economic
