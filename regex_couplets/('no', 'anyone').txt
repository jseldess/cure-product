('no', 'anyone')

into the minority proportion of time
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

on a snow day with my children
Before anyone buys up the opening

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

if not directly on my skin
Before anyone has walked across the opening

of not directly from my skin
