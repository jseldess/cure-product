('no', 'assume')

into the minority proportion of time
I assumed it was visible

Then I cannot see face value
I assumed 

The sun high enough to enter directly
I assumed what I draw

who knows the way
I assume the offers reliable

in that I cannot remember 
I assume the offers revisitable

which is not necessarily possible
I assume the offers divisible

The sun high enough to strike directly
I assumed that they were divisible
