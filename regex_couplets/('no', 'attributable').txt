('no', 'attributable')

into the minority proportion of time
I resume attributable visions

until I could not tire
attributable visions

even when close to my knowing
that decisions can be attributable

But my not feeling the memory inside
decisions that can be attributable

in that I cannot remember 
revisions that can be attributable

for a while not to listen
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

The sun high enough to strike directly
