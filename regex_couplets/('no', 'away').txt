('no', 'away')

into the minority proportion of time
drifting away

asynchronous 
drifting away needs others presume desires

But not to impart cynicism
drifting away needs

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
drifting away from the task

Then I cannot see face value
Who throws contours away

Itâ€™s not marshall exactly
Formerly away there are constant ways

who knows the way
formerly away

But my not feeling the memory inside
