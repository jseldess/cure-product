('no', 'been')

into the minority proportion of time
It has been since

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
After having been contented

Which can be pronounced to the world
that having been after content

Then I cannot see face value
having been graspable

even when close to my knowing
having been an ungraspable time

I used my technology
