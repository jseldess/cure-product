('no', 'bill')

into the minority proportion of time
between bills and stuffed animals

Then I cannot see face value
I hear it between bills and stuff

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
I can hear it between bills and stuff

I take it out in the snow fall
I can hear them between bills and stuff

may not be engrained
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

in not many tracks up in the sky
I cannot hear it between bills

Though in not many acts
billowing in the cloud

even when close to my knowing
until the bill came

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
the bill my detuning 

I returned not sad exactly
bills and stuffed animals

for a while not to listen
