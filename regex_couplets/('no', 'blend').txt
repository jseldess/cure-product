('no', 'blend')

into the minority proportion of time
battery dawn nights blending themselves

and not falling at all
walking into percents blending themselves

even when close to my knowing
where I blend and relive

knowing the constituents
where lights blended themselves

who knows the way
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

between cereal and economic
