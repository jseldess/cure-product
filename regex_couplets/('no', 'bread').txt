('no', 'bread')

into the minority proportion of time
love of breadth

on a snow day with my children
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

for not voting for him
when we had jobs that was to churn some bread

Which can be pronounced to the world
I put my bread down

Then I cannot see face value
