('no', 'but')

into the minority proportion of time
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

asynchronous 
but not impart cynicism

I want but not to impart cynicism
Attributable or

Then I cannot see face value
but the sun isn’t up

out in the snow
but it continued

there was no promotion
but it continued rippling muscle

I take it out in the snow fall
but they are black spots

may not be engrained
but I can hear them

until I could not tire 
I resume attributable visions

until I could not be tired
but where is it

until I could not be hired
attributable visions

even when close to my knowing
that decisions can be attributable

But my not feeling the memory inside
but for memory elsewhere

between cereal and economic
decisions that can be attributable

in that I cannot remember 
revisions that can be attributable

for a while not to listen
but I own all that’s messageable

traffick is there nonetheless
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

The sun high enough to strike directly
