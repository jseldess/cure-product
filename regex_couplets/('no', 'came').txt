('no', 'came')

into the minority proportion of time
I invited most of what came next

there was no promotion
I came back to me

even when close to my knowing
I came after my past

I used my technology
until the bill came

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
and came home to rewind inflections

which is not necessarily possible
and came home to rewind

The sun high enough to strike directly
