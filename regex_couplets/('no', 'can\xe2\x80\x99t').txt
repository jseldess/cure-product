into the minority proportion of time
I can’t fix them without direction

Though how can you know without direction
and can’t presume to need

But not to impart cynicism
Then I can’t presume to need others

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
But I can’t let myself treat 

Then I cannot see face value
That can’t be glimpsed

in front of the set afternoon
Though we can’t help waiting

But my not feeling the memory inside
I can’t remember them

that their knowing
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

The sun high enough to strike directly
