('no', 'cannot')

into the minority proportion of time
Then I cannot see face value

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

not many face up
I cannot clear it also through investiture

though not many facts up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

until I could not tire 
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

in not many tracks up in the sky
I cannot hear it between bills

Though in not many acts
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

though it is not a simple act
in that I cannot remember 

which is not necessarily possible
