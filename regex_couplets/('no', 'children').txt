('no', 'children')

into the minority proportion of time
On a snow day with my children

asynchronous 
as pure as my children

not calling or echoing for once
about my children’s consumption

Then I cannot see face value
only fragments of time with my children

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

does not feel an exception
To my children Walt Whitman

drifting does not feel an exception
To my children

But not to impart cynicism
bearing children along

the drifting is not something special
Even the children

I used my technology
my possession of my children

and it’s not literal
speech my possession of my children

But my not feeling the memory inside
