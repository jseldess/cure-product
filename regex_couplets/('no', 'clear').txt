('no', 'clear')

into the minority proportion of time
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

not many face up
I cannot clear it also through investiture

though not many facts up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

until I could not tire 
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

though it is not a simple act
You can clear it also through static seizure

the simple act of honoring an accountant
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

until I could not be tired
