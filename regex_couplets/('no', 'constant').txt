('no', 'constant')

into the minority proportion of time
with constant ways 

It’s not marshal exactly
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

It’s not marshall exactly
who throws a constant way

who knows the way
with no constant way

with no constant ways 
with no constant waves

There are no constant waves
There are no constant ways

But my not feeling the memory inside
There are constant ways

I end up in Bach with no way
