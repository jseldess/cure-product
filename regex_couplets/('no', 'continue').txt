('no', 'continue')

into the minority proportion of time
but it continued

there was no promotion
but it continued rippling muscle

I take it out in the snow fall
no solid ground to continue along

there was no walking along
and continue along having 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
I continue to presume

even when close to my knowing
I continue to consume

I used my technology
I continued to dream then

that nothing had gravity
