('no', 'could')

into the minority proportion of time
and could be mapped and weighed

Then I cannot see face value
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

not back in the results
until I could not tire 

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
until I could not be tired

The sun high enough to enter directly 
until I could not be hired

even when close to my knowing
I could consume the dream

I used my technology
I could in effect credit

that nothing had gravity
and we could inhabit the room easy

and other types of tracking technology
and could be inflected with reasons

which is not necessarily possible
