('no', 'count')

into the minority proportion of time
Then I constellate my time family country

asynchronous 
So I constellate the time family country

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I brought my count down

Then I cannot see face value
without the long time I was accounting

I take it out in the snow fall
the simple act of honoring an accountant

of honoring surmounted
in the simple act of opening an accountant

until I could not tire
around my country 

until I could not be tired
without the long time I was on accounting

even when close to my knowing
More reasons around my country 

which we can pronounce
