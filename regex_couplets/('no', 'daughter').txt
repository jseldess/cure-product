('no', 'daughter')

into the minority proportion of time
I love my daughter still

I take it out in the snow fall
with my daughter

But my not feeling the memory inside
My daughter with her way

It’s not marshal exactly
My daughter helps too

It’s not marshall exactly
my daughter will learn 

who knows the way
my daughter’s squirrel and chickadee joined me

Aligned or not with my interests
