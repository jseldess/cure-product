('no', 'day')

into the minority proportion of time
On a snow day with my children

asynchronous 
One day there is direction

if not directly on my skin
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
On a day there will be direction

Theyâ€™re just not mine
Actually one day there is direction

how can I know without direction
I argued the days felt longer

and strategies not tactics
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

in front of the set afternoon
The days long aligned

that their economic value 
I argued the days were longer

there was no promotion
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

I take it out in the snow fall
The day

The sun high enough to enter directly
at least most days

But my not feeling the memory aside
