('no', 'days')

into the minority proportion of time
I argued the days felt longer

and strategies not tactics
The days long aligned

that their economic value 
I argued the days were longer

there was no promotion
I agrued the days were longer

I take it out in the snow fall
at least most days

But my not feeling the memory aside
