('no', 'decisions')

into the minority proportion of time
the planning process for decisions

an upsent afternoon
attributable decisions

even when close to my knowing
forgetting decisions 

and itâ€™s not literal
that decisions can be attributable

But my not feeling the memory inside
decisions that can be attributable

in that I cannot remember 
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

The sun high enough to strike directly
