('no', 'desire')

into the minority proportion of time
others desires

does not feel an exception
If I let myself see others desires

But not to impart cynicism
drifting away needs others presume desires

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
Others desires as legitimate

Then I cannot see face value
my desires were open

But not to me directly
I wish my desires were open

in a continuous vertiginous dream
a similar desire against me

not back in the results
