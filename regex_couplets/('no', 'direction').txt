('no', 'direction')

into the minority proportion of time
Whereas direction is beside the point

Then I cannot see face value
into rotating directionless 

on a snow day with my children
Of course there is a direction

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
One day there is direction

if not directly on my skin
on a day there will be direction

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
Actually one day there is direction

how can I know without direction
for how can I know without direction

That is itself not still
in rotating directionless space

not rotating
I can’t fix them without direction

Though how can you know without direction
into rotating and directionless space

They’re just not mine
and then into rotating and directional space

or not even rotating
for how can you know without direction

not even rotating
stopping off in all directions

in that I cannot remember
