('no', 'directly')

into the minority proportion of time
if not directly on my skin

on a snow day with my children
of not directly from my skin

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
But not to me directly

Then I cannot see face value
The sun high enough to enter directly 

it was not just a defeat
The sun high enough to strike directly

in that I cannot remember
