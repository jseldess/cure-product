('no', 'distance')

into the minority proportion of time
Falling from this distance

and not falling at all
A person from a distance

But not to me directly
dislocated and a person from a distance

Then I cannot see face value
And from a weak distance

I used my technology
And from that great distance

that nothing had gravity
