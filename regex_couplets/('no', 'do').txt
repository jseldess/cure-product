('no', 'do')

into the minority proportion of time
The dogs and lillies

Then I cannot see face value
in a sharp downward turn 

asynchronous 
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

on a snow day with my children
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

not calling or echoing for once
In a sharp downard turn

and not falling at all
It keeps coming down thankfully

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
does not feel an exception

but not impart cynicism
drifting does not feel an exception

I want but not to impart cynicism
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

But not to impart cynicism
What does it mean to drift

the drifting is not something special
to the down arrow

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I brought my head down

In a vertiginous dream
I brought my qualities down

in a continuous vertiginous dream
which I brought down with qualities

not back in the results
I put my bread down

there was no promotion
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

out in the snow
What I do in my liesure

I take it out in the snow fall
Undoubtedly 

there was no walking along the pleasure
I walk up and don’t work anymore

it was not just a defeat
So I work and don’t look any

until I could not be tired
here is the site of the battle of maldon

I used my technology
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

that nothing had gravity
and it doesn’t take long

But my not feeling the memory aside
latency which doesn’t mean anything

useless for not having paid
I only think I don’t listen

traffick is there nonetheless
