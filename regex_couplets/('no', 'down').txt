('no', 'down')

into the minority proportion of time
in a sharp downward turn 

asynchronous 
In a sharp downard turn

and not falling at all
It keeps coming down thankfully

on a snow day with my children
to the down arrow

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I brought my head down

Then I cannot see face value
I brought my qualities down

in a continuous vertiginous dream
which I brought down with qualities

not back in the results
I put my bread down

there was no promotion
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

that nothing had gravity
