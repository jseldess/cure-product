('no', 'drift')

into the minority proportion of time
drifting away

asynchronous 
drifting does not feel an exception

I want but not to impart cynicism
drifting away needs others presume desires

But not to impart cynicism
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

For whom drifting is not an exception
What does it mean to drift

the drifting is not something special
Walt Whitman drifted

Then I cannot see face value
drifting away needs

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
at any time it can drift again

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
