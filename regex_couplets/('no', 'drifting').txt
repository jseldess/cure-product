('no', 'drifting')

into the minority proportion of time
drifting away

asynchronous 
drifting does not feel an exception

I want but not to impart cynicism
drifting away needs others presume desires

But not to impart cynicism
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

For whom drifting is not an exception
the drifting is not something special

Then I cannot see face value
drifting away needs

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
drifting away from the task

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
