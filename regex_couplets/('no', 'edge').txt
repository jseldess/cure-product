('no', 'edge')

into the minority proportion of time
I step off the edge

Then I cannot see face value
off the edge of the world

On a snow day with my children
Face falling off the edge of the face

and not falling at all
value falling off the edge of the face

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
The edge is put in place

That is itself not still
The edge isn’t even there

not rotating
I step over the edge

They’re just not mine
If I step on the edge

or not even rotating
If I step over the edge

not even rotating
Falling off the edge of the face

I’ll pull myself another personality type
The value falling off the edge of the face

by no ventillation my purpose
The value falling off the edge of th face

I am told by no ventillation
and testing the edge and gravity

and strategies not tactics
