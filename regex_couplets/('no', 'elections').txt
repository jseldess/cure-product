('no', 'elections')

into the minority proportion of time
on my way to elections

and itâ€™s not literal
formerly my way to the elections

who knows the way
on a way to the elections

between cereal and economic
I stay the right of my elections

I return not sad exactly
stay to my elections

not literally moved
The right of incurred elections

Aligned or not with my interests
