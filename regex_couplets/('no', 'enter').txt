('no', 'enter')

into the minority proportion of time
I have entered my phone

who knows the way
The sun high enough to enter directly 

it was not just a defeat
I enter the flattening mirror

even when close to my knowing
I have entered my purposes

which we can pronounce
I have entered my purchases

I had entered my phone
