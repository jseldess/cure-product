('no', 'exactly')

into the minority proportion of time
It’s not marshal exactly

who knows how to turn it off
It’s not marshall exactly

with no way
I turn not sad exactly

not literally moved about
I return not sad exactly

not literally moved
I returned not sad exactly

aligned or not with my interests
