('no', 'exception')

into the minority proportion of time
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

on a snow day with my children
does not feel an exception

but not impart cynicism
drifting does not feel an exception

I want but not to impart cynicism
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

But not to impart cynicism
For whom drifting is not an exception

the drifting is not something special
