('no', 'explicit')

into the minority proportion of time
explicit statements

though not many facts up in the sky
wrapped in static and explicit statements

I cannot clear it also through investiture
I need an explicit statement

until I could not tire 
which I needed for an explicit state

The sun high enough to enter directly 
for an explicit state

until I could not be tired
