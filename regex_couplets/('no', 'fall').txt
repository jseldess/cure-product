('no', 'fall')

into the minority proportion of time
Then fall then summer from my face

not calling or echoing for once
and not falling at all

Then I cannot see face value
Then fall then summer

on a snow day with my children
Face falling off the edge of the face

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
value falling off the edge of the face

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
The value falling off the edge of the face

I’ll pull myself another personality type
The value falling off the edge of th face

by no ventillation my purpose
I see only the back of falling values

upsent in the afternoon
I see the back of falling values

an upsent afternoon
I can see only values falling back

out in the snow 
I can see only the back of falling values

out in the snow fall
out in the snow falling face value

in front of the set afternoon
falling off the encoded end

I take it out in the snow fall
falling off the end

may not be ingrained
falling off the end of the world

may not be engrained
The first falling syllable

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
