('no', 'far')

into the minority proportion of time
as far as I can see

on a snow day with my children
as far back as my history heard

I take it out in the snow fall
for to tire as far back as my history

until I could not be tired
for as far back as my history

until I could not be hired
in welfare and hope

Aligned or not with my interests
