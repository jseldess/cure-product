not speaking
found dated for my own purchases

But my not feeling the memory aside
and found inundated

But my not feeling the memory inside
and found redundant

knowing the constituents
and latency found

which had on honor to be told
until a happier time found

useless for not having paid
So I found myself at home

for a while not to listen
