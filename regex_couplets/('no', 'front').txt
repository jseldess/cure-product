('no', 'front')

into the minority proportion of time
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

if not directly on my skin
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

in a continuous vertiginous dream
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Then I cannot see face value
in front of the set afternoon

and strategies not tactics
in front of the set of regulations

increasingly that their economic value
And need out in front purchase

I used my technology
behind or out front or up above

I returned not sad exactly
out front

that their knowing
