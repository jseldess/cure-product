('no', 'full')

into the minority proportion of time
It keeps coming down thankfully

on a snow day with my children
I am full of potential

there was no promotion
full of aspirations

I take it out in the snow fall
full of the missing words

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
still carefully

who knows the way
