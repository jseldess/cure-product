('no', 'get')

into the minority proportion of time
I’ll get there eventually

asynchronous 
and is relentlessly budgeted

But not to impart cynicism
I’ll get there ruins

Then I cannot see face value
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

out in the snow
I get through there

even when close to my knowing
in traversing get through there

When closed to my knowing
forgetting decisions 

and it’s not literal
forgettable

which is not necessarily possible
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

The sun high enough to strike directly
and maybe forgettable
