('no', 'goals')

into the minority proportion of time
Though there are quarters goals

Theyâ€™re just not mine
We can wrestle them with their goals

Though how can you know without direction
With goals 

or not even rotating
and without quartely goals

But not to impart cynicism
There are quarterly goals

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
before morning goals

Then I cannot see face value
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

out in the snow
Strategy comes before goals

upsent in the afternoon
not goals

of my economic value
Not goals or tactics

and strategies not tactics
