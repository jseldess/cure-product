('no', 'going')

into the minority proportion of time
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

asynchronous 
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I take it out in the snow fall
The way that she is going

But my not feeling the memory aside
The way that I am going

But my not feeling the memory inside
The way that I was going

It’s not marshal exactly
way I was going 

I end up in Bach with no way
