('no', 'Having')

into the minority proportion of time
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I am told by no ventillation
Having been purchased out of you

I used my technology
Having seen more than 

and itâ€™s not literal
Having seen more than I can remember 

The sun high enough to strike directly
