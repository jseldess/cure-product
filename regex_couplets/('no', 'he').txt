('no', 'he')

into the minority proportion of time
The sun isn’t up 

Then I cannot see face value
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I’ll pull myself another personality type
off the edge of the world

On a snow day with my children
Before we walk across the wide field

asynchronous 
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

not calling or echoing for once
Before we walk across the wide opening

who knows the way
battery dawn nights blending themselves

and not falling at all
Face falling off the edge of the face

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
All of the time

if not directly on my skin
Of course there is a direction

of not directly from my skin
as long as I have access to the code

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
interjecting into the stream of pictures

They’re just not mine
Actually one day there is direction

how can I know without direction
The edge is put in place

That is itself not still
The edge isn’t even there

not rotating
I can’t fix them without direction

Though how can you know without direction
I step over the edge

or not even rotating
If I step over the edge

not even rotating
what I find there

slow asynchronous
The dogs and lillies

but not impart cynicism
others desires

does not feel an exception
Then fall then summer

drifting does not feel an exception
You can hear it also through your leisure

But not to impart cynicism
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
without imparting the cynicism

the drifting is not something special
I am first in the office 

Right now I’m the cart
value falling off the edge of the face

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
here described

by no ventillation my purpose
I am the first in the office

I am told by no ventillation
over the long line up in the sky

over the long line I would honor
until my purpose up in the sky

out in the snow
Then the sun isn’t available

Which can be pronounced to the world
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

If he had not carried one virtue
The world 

not one virtue to excess
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

for not voting for him
when we had jobs that was to churn some bread

which can be pronounced 
only in the case

nor work in this way daily
The South Carolina primary 

was not just a defeat
 and time in the train

In a vertiginous dream
Then the sun isn’t up

in a continuous vertiginous dream
and my heart rate

But not to me directly
Or the company

not back in the results
While I should sleep not back in the results

there was no promotion
And as an extension of the values

So that I notice I am the only one
The ventillation rushes on

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
but the sun isn’t up

upsent in the afternoon
I see only the back

of my economic value
I see the back of the planning process

an upsent afternoon
What the next step

out in the snow fall
out in the snow falling face value

in front of the set afternoon
I tried to feel the key values extending 

and strategies not tactics
I see only the back of my habits

of the economic value my habits
of the habits I create

I am not allowed to see their face
of the economic value

I can see only the back of their economic value
Their economic value

increasingly that their economic value
is a function of the strength

that their economic value 
of the habits they create.

not goals
your bid to the next highest ranked network

I take it out in the snow fall
I can hear it between bills and stuff

there was no walking along the pleasure
there was no walking along

no solid ground to continue along
where you can earn more 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
walking along the measure

may not be ingrained
off the end of the world

may not be engrained
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I even know what I would find
will not be the same

will no be ingrainded 
The first track

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
The long time I had a vision

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
What was the last time

not many face up
On the other hand

though not many freeze up
up in the television pleasure

though not many facts up in the sky
without the long time I was accounting

until I could not tire 
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I cannot clear it also through investiture
up in the television

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

in not many tracks up in the sky
there was no television to hear

I cannot hear it between bills
and stuff up in the sky

Though in not many acts
Though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts
not the simple act

Though it is not a simple act
in the simple act of reading

the simple act of honoring an accountant
the simple act of opening surmounted

until I could not be tired
as far back as my history heard

The sun high enough to enter directly 
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

it was not just a defeat
advancing the time

until I could not be hired
until I purpose the horizon

even when close to my knowing
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

When closed to my knowing
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
here is the site of the battle of maldon

I used my technology
I continued to dream then

that nothing had gravity
without any further damage

so that nothing had gravity
until the bill came

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

and other types of tracking technology
To neither study

nor envy honest work
To substitute neither study

nor envy honestly
Please neither study

which we can pronounce
I send and retrieve the impulse

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
washed my memory

not speaking
Though we are waiting for her

But my not feeling the memory inside
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

from no one point
where I am aside at least

not needing to wait
from cables reheated travels

knowing the constituents
the opinions in my world

which had on honor to be told
for not paying sound overwhelmed

ground for not paying
the resemblance

useless for not having paid
the 

when it is not literal
Where in me did I host

and it’s not literal
in the form filled offered in trust

not literally moved about
washed I answered about

after though there’s no memory
so still washed

It’s not marshal exactly
the other end transactions

who knows how to turn it off
The way that I was going

It’s not marshall exactly
to the other end

with no constant way
to the ends of my transactions

with no constant ways 
who know the ways to their other end

who know the way to their other end
The many transparent pixels call

with no constant waves
There are no constant waves

There are no constant ways
The other end of my transactions

with no way
By my feeling the memory inside

I end up in Bach with no way 
to the other end of transactions

and have no way
on the other end

But my not 
By my memory elsewhere

Aligned or not with my interests
battery dawn nights ending themselves

between cereal and economic
my ethereal economic relations

I return not sad exactly
I stay the right of my elections

not literally moved
to the right of a surcharge

I returned not sad exactly
The right of incurred elections

that their knowing
The weight kept moaned impression

in that I cannot remember 
I assume the offers revisitable

which is not necessarily possible
So I presume the offers already

for a while not to listen
presume the offers at 

traffick is there nonetheless
careening between the preambles

The sun high enough to strike directly
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
