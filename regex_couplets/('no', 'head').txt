('no', 'head')

into the minority proportion of time
Without a head

But not to impart cynicism
I brought my head down

Then I cannot see face value
with my head

In a vertiginous dream
I search with my head

in a continuous vertiginous dream
I put my head down

not back in the results
I log in and search with my head

there was no promotion
into the next level head

and strategies not tactics
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

who knows the way
