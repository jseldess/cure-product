('no', 'hear')

into the minority proportion of time
You can hear it also through your leisure

But not to impart cynicism
and my heart rate

Then I cannot see face value
and my heartrate

But not to me directly
Spinning around the heart

in a continuous vertiginous dream
I hear it between bills and stuff

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I can hear it between bills and stuff

I take it out in the snow fall
that I can hear

may not be ingrained
as far back as my history heard

may not be engrained
that I hear without trying

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I can hear them between bills and stuff

not many face up
but I can hear them

until I could not tire 
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

in not many tracks up in the sky
there was no television to hear

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I cannot hear it between bills

Though in not many acts
You can hear it also through static leisure

until I could not be tired
In my heart did I lose trust

But my not feeling the memory inside
