('no', 'hold')

into the minority proportion of time
I take hold of my finger

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
When they really take hold of my finger

in a continuous vertiginous dream
hold at intervals riding forward

not back in the results
Since I had to hold the entire company

there was no promotion
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

I take it out in the snow fall
and hold and wish to hold

even when close to my knowing
designed to hold up my underwear

that nothing had gravity
