('no', 'if')

into the minority proportion of time
drifting away

asynchronous 
if not directly on my skin

on a snow day with my children
drifting does not feel an exception

I want but not to impart cynicism
drifting away needs others presume desires

But not to impart cynicism
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

For whom drifting is not an exception
What does it mean to drift

the drifting is not something special
Walt Whitman drifted

Then I cannot see face value
drifting away needs

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
at any time it can drift again

I’ll pull myself another personality type
if you have providence to excess

which can be pronounced 
if he had not carried one virtue 

nor work in this way daily
out of the fifth page ruins

there was no promotion
learned without too much difficulty to code

I am told by no ventillation
That company creates a life

I take it out in the snow fall
If I take a different measure

may not be ingrained
If I take some different measure

may not be engrained
if there is anything 

The sun high enough to enter directly
if you have providence

which we can pronounce
if that has anything

and it’s not literal
if only on the way to the trash

for a while not to listen
