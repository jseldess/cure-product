('no', 'inter')

into the minority proportion of time
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

on a snow day with my children
interjecting on a day ambition

if not directly on my skin
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
interferring 

They’re just not mine
way high up in the inter

I’ll pull myself another personality type
higher up in the internet

and not falling at all
way high up in the internet

by no ventillation my purpose
hold at intervals riding forward

in a continuous vertiginous dream
at intervals while riding forward

not back in the results
high up in the internet

there was no promotion
with internally regulated climate

in front of the set afternoon
Then I saw them interview

until I could not be tired
my interfaced stand data

Aligned or not with my interests
I interfaced

between cereal and economic
 as points which are my interest 

I return not sad exactly
The right of interned elections

I returned not sad exactly
