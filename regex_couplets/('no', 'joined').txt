('no', 'joined')

into the minority proportion of time
I was enjoined to act again myself

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I was enjoined to act again

Then I cannot see face value
I was enjoined to act

there was no promotion
I am enjoined to act again

I take it out in the snow fall
joined in my television

Aligned or not with my interests
