('no', 'joy')

into the minority proportion of time
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

on a snow day with my children
I was enjoying acting against myself

there was no promotion
a futile joyous white sun

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
