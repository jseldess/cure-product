('no', 'just')

into the minority proportion of time
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

if not directly on my skin
Theyâ€™re just not mine

how can I know without direction
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Then I cannot see face value
was not just a defeat

nor envy honestly
I just got a letter

upsent in the afternoon
it was not just a defeat

until I could not be tired
