('no', 'know.')

into the minority proportion of time
who knows the way

and not falling at all
how can I know without direction

for how can I know without direction
Though how can you know without direction

Theyâ€™re just not mine
for how can you know without direction

not even rotating
I even know what I would find

will not be the same
even when close to my knowing

When closed to my knowing
knowing the constituents

which had on honor to be told
who knows how to turn it off

Selma knows too 
who know the ways to their other end

But my not feeling the memory inside
who know the way to their other end

with no constant waves
that their knowing

in that I cannot remember
