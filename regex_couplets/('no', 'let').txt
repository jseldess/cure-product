('no', 'let')

into the minority proportion of time
But I can’t let myself treat 

But not to impart cynicism
I let myself treat

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
But I can’t let myself disregard

Then I cannot see face value
It’s the third letter from the end

upsent in the afternoon
I let it remind me again

I used my technology
