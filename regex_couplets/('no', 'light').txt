('no', 'light')

into the minority proportion of time
variegated reflected light

asynchronous 
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

who knows the way
stopped light with validated variegated fields

and not falling at all
In the retroactive light

on a snow day with my children
In the light of retroactive 

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
stopped light with validated fields

not literally moved about
where lights blended themselves

But my not feeling the memory inside
stopped light with validated faces

But my not feeling the memory aside
