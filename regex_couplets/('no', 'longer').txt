('no', 'longer')

into the minority proportion of time
I argued the days felt longer

and strategies not tactics
I argued the days were longer

that their economic value 
I agrued the days were longer

there was no promotion
I argued that the days were longer

I take it out in the snow fall
without longer damage

so that nothing had gravity
without any longer damage

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
