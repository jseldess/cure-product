('no', 'man')

into the minority proportion of time
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

on a snow day with my children
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

does not feel an exception
To my children Walt Whitman

drifting does not feel an exception
Walt Whitman

But not to impart cynicism
What Whitman

the drifting is not something special
Walt Whitman drifted

Then I cannot see face value
There are performance reviews

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
not many face up

though not many freeze up
though not many face up

though not many facts up in the sky
in not many tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
Though in not many acts

Though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

Though it is not many simple acts
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
They have very many choices

not speaking
and that man comes on to tell me 

who knows the way
The many transparent pixel calls

who know the way to their other end
The many transparent pixels call

But my not feeling the memory inside
