('no', 'many')

into the minority proportion of time
not many face up

though not many freeze up
though not many face up

though not many facts up in the sky
in not many tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
Though in not many acts

Though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

Though it is not many simple acts
They have very many choices

not speaking
The many transparent pixel calls

who know the way to their other end
The many transparent pixels call

But my not feeling the memory inside
