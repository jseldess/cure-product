('no', 'middle')

into the minority proportion of time
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
stopping in the middle

which is not necessarily possible
stepping in the middle

for a while not to listen
stepping off into the middle

in that I cannot remember 
stepping off in to the middle
