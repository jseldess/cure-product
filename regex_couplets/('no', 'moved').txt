('no', 'moved')

into the minority proportion of time
and literally moved

The sun high enough to enter directly
myself moved literally as it is

when it is not literal
I literally moved

and it’s not literal
and literally moved about

who knows the way
not literally moved about

after though there’s no memory
not literally moved

Aligned or not with my interests
