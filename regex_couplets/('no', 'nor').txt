('no', 'nor')

into the minority proportion of time
over the long line I would honor

Then I cannot see face value
nor work in this way daily

nor envy honest work
nor envy honestly

In a vertiginous dream
the simple act of honoring an accountant

of honoring surmounted
which had on honor to be told

for not paying redundant
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

But my not feeling the memory inside
