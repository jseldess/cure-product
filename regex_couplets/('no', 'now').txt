('no', 'now')

into the minority proportion of time
On a snow day with my children

asynchronous 
who knows the way

and not falling at all
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

They’re just not mine
how can I know without direction

for how can I know without direction
Though how can you know without direction

or not even rotating
for how can you know without direction

not even rotating
Right now I’m the cart

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
out in the snow

I am told by no ventillation
out in the snow fall

out in the snow falling face value
I take it out in the snow fall

there was no promotion
I even know what I would find

will not be the same
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
even when close to my knowing

When closed to my knowing
knowing the constituents

which had on honor to be told
who knows how to turn it off

Selma knows too 
who know the ways to their other end

But my not feeling the memory inside
who know the way to their other end

with no constant waves
that their knowing

in that I cannot remember
