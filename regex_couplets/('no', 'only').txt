('no', 'only')

into the minority proportion of time
only fragments of time with my children

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
only in the case

if he had not carried one virtue 
So that I notice I am the only one

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
I see only the back of falling values

upsent in the afternoon
I see only the back

of my economic value
I can see only values falling back

an upsent afternoon
I see only the back of my habits

then I cannot see face value
then I can see only the back of values

out in the snow fall
The planning process is for visionaries only

and strategies not tactics
I can see only the back of falling values

out in the snow falling face value
then I can see only the back values

I can see only the back of their economic value
That you can see only the back of

out in the snow
would only willingly break

knowing the constituents
if only on the way to the trash

for a while not to listen
I only think I don’t listen

traffick is there nonetheless
less only money

in that I cannot remember
