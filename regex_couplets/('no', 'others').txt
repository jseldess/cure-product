('no', 'others')

into the minority proportion of time
others desires

does not feel an exception
Then I can’t presume to need others

But not to impart cynicism
If I let myself see others desires

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I presume to others

and it’s not literal
Cereal and others’ health

between cereal and economic
I assume possession to others

in that I cannot remember 
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
