('no', 'over')

into the minority proportion of time
I step over the edge

Theyâ€™re just not mine
If I step over the edge

not even rotating
over the long time up in the sky

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
over the time line I was on

by no ventillation my purpose
over the long line up in the sky

over the long line I would honor
hovering above standing water

there was no promotion
over the long time I was on

Then I cannot see face value
oddly grown over with historic bark

and strategies not tactics
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

it was not just a defeat
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

I used my technology
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

not speaking
for not paying sound overwhelmed

ground for not paying
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

in that I cannot remember
