('no', 'place')

into the minority proportion of time
Put in place as stationary destinations

how can I know without direction
The edge is put in place

That is itself not still
And put in place as though stationary

not rotating
To that impossible place

Then I cannot see face value
The floor slanted in places

and itâ€™s not literal
