('no', 'plan')

into the minority proportion of time
and is relentlessly planned

But not to impart cynicism
The planning process for visions

upsent in the afternoon

an upsent afternoon
The planning process is for visionaries only

and strategies not tactics
the planning process for decisions

then I cannot see face value
and for which the plan agreed

when it is not literal
and to which the plan agreed

and itâ€™s not literal
