('no', 'pleasure')

into the minority proportion of time
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

on a snow day with my children
Which is a pleasure to never live out

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
there was no walking along the pleasure

there was no promotion
up in the television pleasure

though not many facts up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

until I could not tire 
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

though it is not a simple act
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

the simple act of honoring an accountant
You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure

until I could not be tired
