('no', 'possession')

into the minority proportion of time
I speak to them my possessions

and itâ€™s not literal
my possession of my children

But my not feeling the memory inside
I speak them of my possessions

who knows the way
I stay the right of my possessions 

I returned not sad exactly
To the right of interned possessions

Aligned or not with my interests
to the right of possessions

that their knowing
phrase them of our possessions

in that I cannot remember 
phrase them of my possessions

for a while not to listen
Or can have seen offering possession

The sun high enough to strike directly
seen having or offering possession
