('no', 'presume')

into the minority proportion of time
So I presume the offers already

Then I cannot see face value
and can’t presume to need

But not to impart cynicism
Then I can’t presume to need others

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I continue to presume

even when close to my knowing
I presume to others

and it’s not literal
I presume the offers

for a while not to listen
presume the offers at 

traffick is there nonetheless
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

in that I cannot remember
