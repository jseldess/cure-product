('no', 'pull')

into the minority proportion of time
I’ll pull myself another personality type

On a snow day with my children
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

and not falling at all
I’ll pull my data higher up

by no ventillation my purpose
fish pulled out of the lake

in a continuous vertiginous dream
I’ll pull myself higher up

Right now I’m the cart
I’ll pull my data

I am told by no ventillation
