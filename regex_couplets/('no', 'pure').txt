('no', 'pure')

into the minority proportion of time
an impure product

asynchronous 
as pure as my children

on a snow day with my children
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

not calling or echoing for once
What is an impure product

and not falling at all
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

does not feel an exception
as a pure product

drifting does not feel an exception
as an impure product

But not to impart cynicism
