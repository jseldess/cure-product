('no', 'purposes')

into the minority proportion of time
I tell you my purposes

I used my technology
I tell you the weight of my purposes

that nothing had gravity
Where I host my purposes

and other types of tracking technology
I have entered my purposes

which we can pronounce
the impulse for my own purposes

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
elsewhere my purposes

not speaking
for my own purposes

I return not sad exactly
