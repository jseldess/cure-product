('no', 'reason')

into the minority proportion of time
reasons resources

asynchronous 
with reasons

not one virtue to excess
with little reason to move

there was no promotion
with little reason to aspiration

I take it out in the snow fall
Toward the start informally given my reasons

until I could not be tired
More reasons around my country 

which we can pronounce
and could be inflected with reasons

which is not necessarily possible
