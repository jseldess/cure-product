('no', 'redundant')

into the minority proportion of time
and sound redundant

But my not feeling the memory aside
and found redundant

But my not feeling the memory inside
and around redundant

knowing the constituents
for not paying redundant

for not paying sound overwhelmed
redundant

who knows the way
