('no', 'retroactive')

into the minority proportion of time
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

who knows the way
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light

and not falling at all
In the retroactive light

on a snow day with my children
In the light of retroactive 

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
