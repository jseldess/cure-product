('no', 'rotating')

into the minority proportion of time
into rotating directionless 

Then I cannot see face value
Rather it itself is rotating

not rotating
into rotating and directionless space

Though how can you know without direction
and then into rotating and directional space

or not even rotating
not even rotating

slow asynchronous
