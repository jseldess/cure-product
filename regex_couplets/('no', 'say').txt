('no', 'say')

into the minority proportion of time
we had to say goodbye

I used my technology
I ask say in that case

and itâ€™s not literal
we ask say in that case

But my not feeling the memory inside
formerly along my say to the elections

who knows the way
My say to the elections

between cereal and economic
I ask say in that phase decisioned

for a while not to listen
