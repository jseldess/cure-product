('no', 'seen')

into the minority proportion of time
under the last seen principle

even when close to my knowing
Having seen more than 

and itâ€™s not literal
being seen by me

for a while not to listen
Having seen more than I can remember 

The sun high enough to strike directly
Or can have seen offering possession

in that I cannot remember 
seen having or offering possession
