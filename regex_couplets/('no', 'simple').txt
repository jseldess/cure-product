('no', 'simple')

into the minority proportion of time
simple black spots

Though in not many acts up in the sky
Though it is not many simple acts

not the simple act
Though it is not a simple act

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in the simple act of reading

the simple act of honoring an accountant
the simple act of opening surmounted

until I could not tire
