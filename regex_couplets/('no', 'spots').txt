('no', 'spots')

into the minority proportion of time
white spots on a black surface

I take it out in the snow fall
but they are black spots

may not be engrained
black spots on a white surface

I even know what I would find
simple black spots

Though in not many acts up in the sky
all the spots

that nothing had gravity
