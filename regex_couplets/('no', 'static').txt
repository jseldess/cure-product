('no', 'static')

into the minority proportion of time
wrapped in static and explicit statements

I cannot clear it also through investiture
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

until I could not tire 
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

though it is not a simple act
You can clear it also through static seizure

the simple act of honoring an accountant
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

until I could not be tired
while wrapped in static

The sun high enough to enter directly 
while wrapped in explicit static

until I could not be hired
