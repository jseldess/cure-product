('no', 'still')

into the minority proportion of time
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

asynchronous 
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

on a snow day with my children
That is itself not still

not rotating
wrestling me to stay still

Though how can you know without direction
I love my daughter still

I take it out in the snow fall
though we are still breaking in

not speaking
still wash conserving

who knows the way
so still them

after though there’s no memory
so still washed

But my not feeling the memory inside
