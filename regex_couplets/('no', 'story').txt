('no', 'story')

into the minority proportion of time
I told her a story, she drew waves.

on a snow day with my children
Forecasting the story before dawn

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
as far back as my history heard

I take it out in the snow fall
You need history

until I could not be tired
for to tire as far back as my history

until I could not be hired
for as far back as my history

even when close to my knowing
