('no', 'television')

into the minority proportion of time
there wasnâ€™t any television 

I take it out in the snow fall
up in the television pleasure

though not many facts up in the sky
up in the television

until I could not tire 
there was no television to hear

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
joined in my television

Aligned or not with my interests
