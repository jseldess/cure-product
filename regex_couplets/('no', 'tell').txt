('no', 'tell')

into the minority proportion of time
Then I constellate my time family country

asynchronous 
So I constellate the time family country

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I constellate the time

not one virtue to excess
The CEO tells me to embody values

But not to me directly
I had to tell them the news

there was no promotion
I tell you my purposes

I used my technology
I tell you the weight of my purchases

that nothing had gravity
and that man comes on to tell me 

who knows the way
