('no', 'than')

into the minority proportion of time
It keeps coming down thankfully

on a snow day with my children
than in the incoming stream

if not directly on my skin
than solid ground

because there was no solid ground to continue along
Having seen more than 

and itâ€™s not literal
Having seen more than I can remember 

The sun high enough to strike directly
