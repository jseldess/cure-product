('no', 'themselves')

into the minority proportion of time
battery dawn nights blending themselves

and not falling at all
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I take it out in the snow fall
talking into percents bending themselves

even when close to my knowing
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

But my not feeling the memory aside
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

who knows the way
battery dawn nights ending themselves

between cereal and economic
