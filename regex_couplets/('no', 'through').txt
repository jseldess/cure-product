('no', 'through')

into the minority proportion of time
You can hear it also through your leisure

But not to impart cynicism
Back up through the results

in a continuous vertiginous dream
back up through results

Then I cannot see face value
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

not many face up
I cannot clear it also through investiture

though not many facts up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

until I could not tire 
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

though it is not a simple act
You can clear it also through static seizure

the simple act of honoring an accountant
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

until I could not be tired
I get through there

even when close to my knowing
in traversing get through there

When closed to my knowing
