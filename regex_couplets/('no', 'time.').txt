('no', 'time.')

into the minority proportion of time
Where I sleep at times

Then I cannot see face value
Then I constellate my time family country

asynchronous 
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

on a snow day with my children
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

not calling or echoing for once
only fragments of time with my children

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
at any time it can drift again

But not to impart cynicism
over the long time up in the sky

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
That’s where I sleep at times

I’ll pull myself another personality type
So I constellate the time family country

Right now I’m the cart
on the time line I was on

by no ventillation my purpose
over the time line I was on

I am told by no ventillation
 and time in the train

In a vertiginous dream
I spend time online learning to code

in a continuous vertiginous dream
On the timeline I was on

and not falling at all
over the long time I was on

out in the snow
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

upsent in the afternoon
The long time I had a vision

I take it out in the snow fall
without the long time I was accounting

may not be ingrained
The long time I was a vision

until I could not be tired
which is the long time I was on

even when close to my knowing
or alter of course the time anyway

The sun high enough to enter directly
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

not speaking
until a happier time found

useless for not having paid
formerly a long time they were on

and it’s not literal
formerly along time they were on

But my not feeling the memory inside
time they were on

who knows the way
in the long time they were on

between cereal and economic
