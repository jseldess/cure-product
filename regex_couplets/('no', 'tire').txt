('no', 'tire')

into the minority proportion of time
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

there was no promotion
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

I take it out in the snow fall
until I could not tire 

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
until I could not be tired

The sun high enough to enter directly 
for to tire as far back as my history

until I could not be hired
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
