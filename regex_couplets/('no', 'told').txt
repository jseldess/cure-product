('no', 'told')

into the minority proportion of time
I told her a story, she drew waves.

on a snow day with my children
I am told ventillation

by no ventillation my purpose
I am told by no ventillation

over the long line I would honor
I am told by the ventillation

So that I notice I am the only one
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
which ran to be told

which had on honor to be told
