('no', 'too')

into the minority proportion of time
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

asynchronous 
too sunny to eat ice cream

not calling or echoing for once
emerging this year from too much standing water

there was no promotion
learned without too much difficulty to code

I am told by no ventillation
Selma knows too 

But my not feeling the memory inside
Selma helps too

It’s not marshal exactly
