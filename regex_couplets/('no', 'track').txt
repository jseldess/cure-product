('no', 'track')

into the minority proportion of time
I reuse indelible tracks 

I take it out in the snow fall
The first track

may not be ingrained
I refuse indelible tracks

not many face up
I resume indelible tracks

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

until I could not tire 
in not many tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
and other types of tracking technology

was not just a defeat
trackers collecting data on users

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
The trackers on users

not speaking
which as tracked befitted 

and itâ€™s not literal
which as tracked befitted phased

But my not feeling the memory inside
sizes track for asking sound

who knows the way
sizes asking for tracking sound

for a while not to listen
