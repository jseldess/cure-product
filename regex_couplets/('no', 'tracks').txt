('no', 'tracks')

into the minority proportion of time
I reuse indelible tracks 

I take it out in the snow fall
I refuse indelible tracks

not many face up
I resume indelible tracks

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

until I could not tire 
in not many tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
