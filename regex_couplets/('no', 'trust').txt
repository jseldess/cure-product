('no', 'trust')

into the minority proportion of time
I have them trust in me

even when close to my knowing
in the form filled offered in trust

The sun high enough to enter directly
about the sight hosting trusting

who knows the way
in the form filled offered trust 

But my not feeling the memory inside
