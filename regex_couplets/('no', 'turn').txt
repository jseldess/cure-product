('no', 'turn')

into the minority proportion of time
in a sharp downward turn 

asynchronous 
In a sharp downard turn

and not falling at all
sudden downward turn

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I keep turning back again myself

In a vertiginous dream
I keep turning back

in a continuous vertiginous dream
who knows how to turn it off

Selma knows too 
Bach helps turn it off

But my not feeling the memory inside
I have turned it off

Itâ€™s not marshal exactly
I turn not sad exactly

not literally moved about
I return not sad exactly

not literally moved
I returned not sad exactly

aligned or not with my interests
to return what I bought

that their knowing
