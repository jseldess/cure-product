('no', 'until')

into the minority proportion of time
until my purpose up in the sky

Then I cannot see face value
until I could not tire 

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
until I could not be tired

The sun high enough to enter directly 
until I could not be hired

even when close to my knowing
until I purpose up in the sky

I used my technology
until I purchase up the sky

that nothing had gravity
until the bill came

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
until a happier time found

useless for not having paid
