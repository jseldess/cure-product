('no', 'up?')

into the minority proportion of time
The sun isn’t up 

Then I cannot see face value
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I’ll get there eventually

asynchronous 
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

on a snow day with my children
because it was really dark

not calling or echoing for once
In a sharp downard turn

and not falling at all
value falling off the edge of the face

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

if not directly on my skin
Of course there is a direction

of not directly from my skin
Then fall then summer

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
interjecting into the stream of pictures

They’re just not mine
Actually one day there is direction

how can I know without direction
for how can I know without direction

That is itself not still
As though stationary and a destination

not rotating
russling to stay still

Though how can you know without direction
though there are quarters with goals

or not even rotating
for how can you know without direction

not even rotating
slow asynchronous

does not feel an exception
but not impart cynicism

I want but not to impart cynicism
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

drifting does not feel an exception
as a pure product

But not to impart cynicism
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Without imparting cynicism 

the drifting is not something special
Puffs of air

Right now I’m the cart
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
But in more 

by no ventillation my purpose
to be before the sun

I am told by no ventillation
over the long line up in the sky

over the long line I would honor
until my purpose up in the sky

out in the snow
Then the sun isn’t available

Which can be pronounced to the world
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

If he had not carried one virtue
if you have providence to excess

which can be pronounced 
I want to cite a poem so usual

not one virtue to excess
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

for not voting for him
when we had jobs that was to churn some bread

nor work in this way daily
The South Carolina primary 

was not just a defeat
Blue sky or

In a vertiginous dream
I keep turning back again myself

in a continuous vertiginous dream
out of remnant pages

But not to me directly
Spinning around the heart

not back in the results
While I should sleep not back in the results

there was no promotion
And as an extension of the values

So that I notice I am the only one
The ventillation rushes on

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
Then the sun isn’t up

upsent in the afternoon
of my economic value

an upsent afternoon
blue and sun again a second, then night

out in the snow fall
out in the snow falling face value

in front of the set afternoon
I tried to feel the key values extending 

and strategies not tactics
of the economic value my habits

I am not allowed to see their face
of the economic value

I can see only the back of their economic value
Their economic value

increasingly that their economic value
is a function of the strength

that their economic value 
your bid to the next highest ranked network

not goals
I hear it between bills and stuff

I take it out in the snow fall
I can hear it between bills and stuff

there was no walking along the pleasure
no solid ground to continue along

there was no walking along
where you can earn more 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
walking along the measure

may not be ingrained
but they are black spots

may not be engrained
black spots on a white surface

I even know what I would find
White spots on a black surface

will not be the same
that I hear without trying

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I resume unassimilable visions

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
I refuse indelible tracts

not many face up
though not many freeze up

though not many face up
up in the television pleasure

though not many facts up in the sky
If I take a different measure

until I could not tire 
I resume indelible tracks

I cannot clear it also through investiture
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
and stuff up in the sky

Though in not many acts
Though in not many acts up in the sky

Though in not many facts
Though it is not many simple acts

not the simple act
While we’re up in the sky

Though it is not a simple act
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

the simple act of honoring an accountant
of honoring surmounted

until I could not be tired
You can hear it also through your leisure

The sun high enough to enter directly 
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

it was not just a defeat
though it was most emphatically that

until I could not be hired
until I purpose the horizon

even when close to my knowing
If I take some different measure

When closed to my knowing
of my purpose in conversing

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I used my technology
I continued to dream then

that nothing had gravity
My means without gravity

so that nothing had gravity
I captured an afterimage

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

and other types of tracking technology
To neither study

nor envy honest work
This is your voice 

nor envy honestly
Um, upset by Gingrich

which we can pronounce
I send and retrieve the impulse

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
I thought

not speaking
I though

But my not feeling the memory inside
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

from no one point
for the duration of the answer

not needing to wait
and relive from burrowed travels

knowing the constituents
and found redundant

which had on honor to be told
for not paying redundant

for not paying sound overwhelmed
ground for not paying

useless for not having paid
without really binding myself

when it is not literal
in the form filled offered in trust

and it’s not literal
it can be uncomfortable 

who knows the way
I answered about

not literally moved about
washed I answered about

after though there’s no memory
in the form filled offered must

It’s not marshal exactly
I end up Bach

who knows how to turn it off
Though we are waiting for her

It’s not marshall exactly
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

with no way
Who throws contours away

with no constant way
The contours exchange with you

with no constant ways 
I end up in Bach

who know the ways to their other end
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

There are no constant ways
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

I end up in Bach with no way 
and end up in Bach

and have no way
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

But my not 
Selma’s squirrel and chickadee

Aligned or not with my interests
which I feel formerly about for

I turn not sad exactly
radiating from housing

between cereal and economic
about 

I return not sad exactly
for my own purposes

not literally moved
to the right of a surcharge

I returned not sad exactly
The right of incurred elections

that their knowing
sung reflexing

in that I cannot remember 
I assume the offers revisitable

which is not necessarily possible
So I presume the offers already

for a while not to listen
presume the offers at 

traffick is there nonetheless
I presume the offers

The sun high enough to strike directly
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
