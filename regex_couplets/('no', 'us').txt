('no', 'us')

into the minority proportion of time
I suspend live connections to you

Then I cannot see face value
asynchronous 

On a snow day with my children
because it was really dark

not calling or echoing for once
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

if not directly on my skin
They’re just not mine

how can I know without direction
russling to stay still

Though how can you know without direction
slow asynchronous

does not feel an exception
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I want to cite a poem so usual

not one virtue to excess
was not just a defeat

nor envy honestly
In a vertiginous dream

in a continuous vertiginous dream
You use the most essential parts

not back in the results
Remnant continuous pages

there was no promotion
The ventillation rushes on

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
I just got a letter

upsent in the afternoon
So stay with us

I take it out in the snow fall
because there was no solid ground to continue along

may not be ingrained
I reuse indelible tracks

may not be engrained
I refuse indelible tracts

not many face up
it was not just a defeat

until I could not be tired
I have them trust in me

even when close to my knowing
a futile joyous white sun

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Articles all around us

I used my technology
I wear suspenders

that nothing had gravity
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

The sun high enough to enter directly

not speaking
in the form filled offered in trust

But my not feeling the memory aside
useless for not having paid

when it is not literal
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

who knows the way
in the form filled offered must

But my not feeling the memory inside
radiating from housing

between cereal and economic
