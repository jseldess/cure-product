('no', 'ventillation')

into the minority proportion of time
I am told ventillation

by no ventillation my purpose
I am told by no ventillation

over the long line I would honor
I am told by the ventillation

So that I notice I am the only one
The ventillation rushes on

So that I donâ€™t notice I am the only one
