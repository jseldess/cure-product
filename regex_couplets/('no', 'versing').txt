('no', 'versing')

into the minority proportion of time
in traversing my purchase

I take it out in the snow fall
though as for conversing

until I could not tire 
of my purpose in versing

even when close to my knowing
of my purpose in conversing

When closed to my knowing
in conversing of my purpose

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
