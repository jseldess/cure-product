('no', 'visible')

into the minority proportion of time
I assumed it was visible

Then I cannot see face value
Iâ€™ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

and not falling at all
And make myself a visible

by no ventillation my purpose
Divisible or

In a vertiginous dream
I assume the offers divisible

which is not necessarily possible
that they were divisible

The sun high enough to strike directly
I assumed that they were divisible

in that I cannot remember
