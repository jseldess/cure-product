('no', 'vision')

into the minority proportion of time
I had me a vision

there was no promotion
The planning process for visions

upsent in the afternoon
The planning process is for visionaries only

and strategies not tactics
aspirating visions

in front of the set afternoon
aspirating with visions

I take it out in the snow fall
there wasnâ€™t any television 

may not be ingrained
I resume unassimilable visions

may not be engrained
The long time I had a vision

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
up in the television pleasure

though not many facts up in the sky
up in the television

until I could not tire 
there was no television to hear

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I resume attributable visions

until I could not be tired
The long time I was a vision

until I could not be hired
I had a vision

even when close to my knowing
attributable visions

When closed to my knowing
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
joined in my television

Aligned or not with my interests
visions that can be attainable

for a while not to listen
revisions that can be attributable

traffick is there nonetheless
