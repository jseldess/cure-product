('no', 'visions')

into the minority proportion of time
The planning process for visions

upsent in the afternoon
aspirating visions

in front of the set afternoon
aspirating with visions

there was no promotion
embodied with little visions

I take it out in the snow fall
I resume unassimilable visions

may not be ingrained
I resume attributable visions

until I could not tire
attributable visions

even when close to my knowing
visions that can be attainable

for a while not to listen
revisions that can be attributable

traffick is there nonetheless
