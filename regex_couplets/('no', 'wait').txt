('no', 'wait')

into the minority proportion of time
There are spots waiting

that nothing had gravity
Though we are waiting for her

The sun high enough to enter directly
not needing to wait

But my not feeling the memory aside
Though we are waiting 

and it’s not literal
Though we can’t help waiting

But my not feeling the memory inside
waiting out front or up above 

I returned not sad exactly
waiting out front or up above or behind

that their knowing
