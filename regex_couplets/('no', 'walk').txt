('no', 'walk')

into the minority proportion of time
Before we walk across the wide field

asynchronous 
Before we walk across the wide opening

who knows the way
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

on a snow day with my children
Before anyone walks across the opening

if not directly on my skin
Before anyone has walked across the opening

of not directly from my skin
there was no walking along the pleasure

there was no promotion
there was no walking along

no solid ground to continue along
walking along the measure

I take it out in the snow fall
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

it was not just a defeat
walking into percents blending themselves

even when close to my knowing
