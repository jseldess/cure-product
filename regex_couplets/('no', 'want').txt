('no', 'want')

into the minority proportion of time
When I want something

on a snow day with my children
I want to find a way to block it incoming

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
That’s exaclty what I want for them

if not directly on my skin
I want but not to impart cynicism

does not feel an exception
I want to cite a poem so usual

Then I cannot see face value
I want to cite a poem

if he had not carried one virtue 
all that I can think I want

may not be engrained
