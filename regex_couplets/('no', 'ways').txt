('no', 'ways')

into the minority proportion of time
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

on a snow day with my children
always watching

even when close to my knowing
deep into pathways from repeated travels

But my not feeling the memory aside
with constant ways 

It’s not marshal exactly
with her ways to the ends

But my not feeling the memory inside
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

It’s not marshall exactly
There are constant ways

who knows the way
with no constant ways 

who know the ways to their other end
There are no constant ways

with no way
Formerly away there are constant ways

I end up in Bach with no way
