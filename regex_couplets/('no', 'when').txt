('no', 'When')

into the minority proportion of time
When I woke up in the morning

not calling or echoing for once
When I want something

on a snow day with my children
When we had jobs that were to earn

not one virtue to excess
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

for not voting for him
When they really take hold of my finger

in a continuous vertiginous dream
When closed to my knowing

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
When I'm watching my tv 

who knows the way
