('no', 'white')

into the minority proportion of time
white spots on a black surface

I take it out in the snow fall
black spots on a white surface

may not be engrained
a futile joyous white sun

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
