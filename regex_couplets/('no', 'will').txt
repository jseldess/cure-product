('no', 'will')

into the minority proportion of time
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

on a snow day with my children
on a day there will be direction

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
will not be the same

will no be ingrainded 
that will spur me on

even when close to my knowing
would only willingly break

knowing the constituents
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

who knows the way
my daughter will learn 

But my not feeling the memory inside
