('no', 'world')

into the minority proportion of time
off the edge of the world

On a snow day with my children
Which can be pronounced to the world

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
The world 

Then I cannot see face value
off the end of the world

in front of the set afternoon
hauling off the end of the world

may not be ingrained
falling off the end of the world

may not be engrained
the opinions in my world

which had on honor to be told
