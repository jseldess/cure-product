('no', 'you.')

into the minority proportion of time
Though how can you know without direction

Theyâ€™re just not mine
for how can you know without direction

not even rotating
You can hear it also through your leisure

But not to impart cynicism
bring your child along

the drifting is not something special
if you have providence to excess

which can be pronounced 
If you have confidence regardless all else

if he had not carried one virtue 
May I have your zip code

Then I cannot see face value
That you can see only the back of

an upsent afternoon
your bid to the next highest ranked network

and strategies not tactics
since you can imagine movement

there was no promotion
where you can earn more 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
you need history

until I could not be tired
a futile joyous white sun

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I tell you my purposes

I used my technology
I tell you the weight of my purchases

that nothing had gravity
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

The sun high enough to enter directly
This is your voice 

nor work in this way daily
This is your choice 

nor envy honest work
This is your chance

which we can pronounce
the young ripples inaudibly

in that I cannot remember
