('nor', 'My')

into the minority proportion of time
My live connections to you

over the long line I would honor
My associations

the simple act of honoring an accountant
My purpose up in the sky

nor work in this way daily
My daughter with her way

Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor
My say to the elections
