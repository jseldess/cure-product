('nor', 'Which')

into the minority proportion of time
Which is a measure to never live out

over the long line I would honor
Which can be pronounced to the world

nor work in this way daily
Which is a pleasure to never live out

nor envy honest work
Which can be called confidence

nor envy honestly
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
