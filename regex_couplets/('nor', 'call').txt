('nor', 'call')

into the minority proportion of time
not calling or echoing for once

over the long line I would honor
though it was most emphatically that

nor work in this way daily
They are called aspirational

the simple act of honoring an accountant
Which can be called confidence

nor envy honest work
to take the call

which had on honor to be told
The many transparent pixel calls

Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor
recalling aside
