('nor', 'count')

into the minority proportion of time
Then I constellate my time family country

over the long line I would honor
So I constellate the time family country

nor work in this way daily
I brought my count down

the simple act of honoring an accountant
in the simple act of opening an accountant

nor envy honest work
More reasons around my country 

which had on honor to be told
