('nor', 'do')

into the minority proportion of time
The dogs and lillies

over the long line I would honor
I brought my head down

the simple act of honoring an accountant
What I do in my liesure

nor work in this way daily
and it doesn’t take long

which had on honor to be told
latency which doesn’t mean anything

Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor
I only think I don’t listen
