('nor', 'earn')

into the minority proportion of time
in light of learning what we see

over the long line I would honor
When we had jobs that were to earn

nor work in this way daily
I spend time online learning to code

the simple act of honoring an accountant
decisioned to learn 

Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor
decisioned to learn back
