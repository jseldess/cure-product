('nor', 'eat')

into the minority proportion of time
too sunny to eat ice cream

over the long line I would honor
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

nor work in this way daily
was not just a defeat

nor envy honestly
Where I put it beating

the simple act of honoring an accountant
it was not just a defeat

nor envy honest work
for the creation of the universe

which had on honor to be told
burrowed about from repeated travels
