('nor', 'ending')

into the minority proportion of time
battery dawn nights blending themselves

over the long line I would honor
I tried to feel the key values extending 

the simple act of honoring an accountant
talking into pheasants bending themselves

nor work in this way daily
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

which had on honor to be told
battery dawn nights ending themselves
