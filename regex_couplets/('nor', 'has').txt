('nor', 'has')

into the minority proportion of time
conversations with our purchase

over the long line I would honor
It has been since

nor work in this way daily
in traversing my purchase

the simple act of honoring an accountant
purchased out

nor envy honest work
I have entered my purchases

which had on honor to be told
if that has anything

Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor
phase decisioned by the prospect
