('nor', 'he')

into the minority proportion of time
The sun isnâ€™t up 

over the long line I would honor
until my purpose up in the sky

nor work in this way daily
The South Carolina primary 

nor envy honestly
 and time in the train

the simple act of honoring an accountant
the simple act of opening surmounted

nor envy honest work
To neither study

which had on honor to be told
for not paying sound overwhelmed
