('nor', 'here')

into the minority proportion of time
Where I sleep at times

over the long line I would honor
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

nor work in this way daily
Where official policy is to catch and release

the simple act of honoring an accountant
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

nor envy honest work
and elsewhere my memory of you

which had on honor to be told
Where in me did I host

Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor
where rights ended themselves
