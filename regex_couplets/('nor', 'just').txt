('nor', 'just')

into the minority proportion of time
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

over the long line I would honor
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

nor work in this way daily
was not just a defeat

nor envy honestly
I just got a letter

the simple act of honoring an accountant
it was not just a defeat

nor envy honest work
