('nor', 'now')

into the minority proportion of time
On a snow day with my children

over the long line I would honor
out in the snow

nor work in this way daily
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

the simple act of honoring an accountant
even when close to my knowing

nor envy honest work
knowing the constituents

which had on honor to be told
who knows the way

Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor
that their knowing
