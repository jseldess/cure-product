('nor', 'ring')

into the minority proportion of time
interferring 

over the long line I would honor
ring

nor work in this way daily
hovering above standing water

the simple act of honoring an accountant
of honoring surmounted

nor envy honest work
firing and connecting somewhere

which had on honor to be told
The prospect for veering healthily
