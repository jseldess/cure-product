('nor', 'set')

into the minority proportion of time
upset by Gingrich

nor work in this way daily
in front of the set afternoon

the simple act of honoring an accountant
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

nor envy honest work
Um, upset by Gingrich

nor envy honestly
presets
