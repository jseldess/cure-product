('nor', 'up?')

into the minority proportion of time
The sun isnâ€™t up 

over the long line I would honor
until my purpose up in the sky

nor work in this way daily
The South Carolina primary 

nor envy honestly
Blue sky or

the simple act of honoring an accountant
of honoring surmounted

nor envy honest work
was not just a defeat

which had on honor to be told
for not paying redundant

Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor
and end up in Bach
