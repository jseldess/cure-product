('nor', 'us')

into the minority proportion of time
I suspend live connections to you

over the long line I would honor
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

nor work in this way daily
was not just a defeat

nor envy honestly
In a vertiginous dream

the simple act of honoring an accountant
I want to cite a poem so usual

nor envy honest work
trackers collecting data on users

which had on honor to be told
useless for not having paid

Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor
radiating from housing
