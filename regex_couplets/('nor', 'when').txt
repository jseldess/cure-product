('nor', 'When')

into the minority proportion of time
When I woke up in the morning

over the long line I would honor
When we had jobs that were to earn

nor work in this way daily
When they really take hold of my finger

the simple act of honoring an accountant
When closed to my knowing

nor envy honest work
When I'm watching my tv
