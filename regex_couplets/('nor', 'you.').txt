('nor', 'you.')

into the minority proportion of time
Though how can you know without direction

over the long line I would honor
You can hear it also through your leisure

nor work in this way daily
May I have your zip code

the simple act of honoring an accountant
If you have confidence regardless all else

nor envy honest work
This is your voice 

nor envy honestly
This is your choice 

which had on honor to be told
the young ripples inaudibly
