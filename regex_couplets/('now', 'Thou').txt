('now', 'Thou')

On a snow day with my children
Though there are quarters goals

how can I know without direction
Though how can you know without direction

for how can you know without direction
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I take it out in the snow fall
Though in not many acts

even when close to my knowing
Though we are waiting for her

knowing the constituents
Though we are waiting 

who knows the way
Though we can’t help waiting

who know the ways to their other end
