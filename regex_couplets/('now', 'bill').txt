('now', 'bill')

On a snow day with my children
I hear it between bills and stuff

Right now Iâ€™m the cart
I can hear it between bills and stuff

I take it out in the snow fall
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I even know what I would find
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

even when close to my knowing
until the bill came

knowing the constituents
the bill my detuning 

that their knowing
between bills and stuffed animals
