('now', 'blend')

On a snow day with my children
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
walking into percents blending themselves

even when close to my knowing
where I blend and relive

knowing the constituents
where lights blended themselves

who knows the way
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

that their knowing
