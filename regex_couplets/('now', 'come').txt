('now', 'come')

On a snow day with my children
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

who knows the way
Strategy comes before morning

out in the snow
Strategy comes before goals

out in the snow fall
and that man comes on to tell me 

who knows how to turn it off
and come home to remind inflections
