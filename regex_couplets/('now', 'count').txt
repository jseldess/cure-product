('now', 'count')

On a snow day with my children
Then I constellate my time family country

who knows the way
So I constellate the time family country

Right now Iâ€™m the cart
I brought my count down

out in the snow
without the long time I was accounting

I take it out in the snow fall
the simple act of honoring an accountant

even when close to my knowing
More reasons around my country 

knowing the constituents
