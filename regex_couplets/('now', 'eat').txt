('now', 'eat')

On a snow day with my children
too sunny to eat ice cream

who knows the way
I reach repeated expressions first

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
But I can’t let myself treat 

Right now I’m the cart
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

out in the snow
was not just a defeat

out in the snow fall
of the habits I create

out in the snow falling face value
of the habits they create

I take it out in the snow fall
it was not just a defeat

even when close to my knowing
And from that great distance

knowing the constituents
for the creation of the universe

that their knowing
