('now', 'low')

On a snow day with my children
slow

who knows the way
slow asynchronous

Right now Iâ€™m the cart
to the pillow

out in the snow
low in the content architecture

out in the snow fall
I am not allowed to see their face

I take it out in the snow fall
under pillowing a cloud

even when close to my knowing
