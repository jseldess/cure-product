('now', 'plan')

On a snow day with my children
and is relentlessly planned

Right now Iâ€™m the cart
The planning process for visions

out in the snow
I see the back of the planning process

out in the snow fall
The planning process is for visionaries only

out in the snow falling face value
and for which the plan agreed

who knows the way
