('now', 'rate')

On a snow day with my children
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

who knows the way
and my heart rate

Right now Iâ€™m the cart
Strategy comes before morning

out in the snow
Strategy comes before goals

out in the snow fall
and strategies not tactics

out in the snow falling face value
Aspirational strategy

I take it out in the snow fall
