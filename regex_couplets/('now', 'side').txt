('now', 'side')

On a snow day with my children
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

who knows the way
I’m simply inside

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
aside from the retinas

I take it out in the snow fall
actually considering the end

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
But my not feeling the memory aside

knowing the constituents
by the side of the hosting service

who knows how to turn it off
But my not feeling the memory inside

who know the ways to their other end
By my feeling the memory inside

that their knowing
