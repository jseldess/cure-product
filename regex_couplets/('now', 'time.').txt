('now', 'time.')

On a snow day with my children
Then I constellate my time family country

who knows the way
only fragments of time with my children

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
where I sleep at times

Right now Iâ€™m the cart
over the long time up in the sky

out in the snow
over the time line I was on

out in the snow fall
The long time I had a vision

I take it out in the snow fall
without the long time I was accounting

I even know what I would find
So I constellate the time family country

even when close to my knowing
or alter of course the time anyway

knowing the constituents
until a happier time found

who knows how to turn it off
formerly along time they were on

that their knowing
