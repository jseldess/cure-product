('now', 'too.')

On a snow day with my children
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

who knows the way
emerging this year from too much standing water

Right now I’m the cart
learned without too much difficulty to code

out in the snow
Selma knows too 

who know the ways to their other end
