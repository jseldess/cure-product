('now', 'use')

On a snow day with my children
because it was really dark

who knows the way
You use the most essential parts

Right now Iâ€™m the cart
I reuse unassimilable visions

I take it out in the snow fall
because there was no solid ground to continue along

I even know what I would find
I refuse indelible tracts

even when close to my knowing
I used my technology

knowing the constituents
useless for not having paid

who knows how to turn it off
