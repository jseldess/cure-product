('now', 'you.')

On a snow day with my children
Though how can you know without direction

for how can you know without direction
You can hear it also through your leisure

Right now Iâ€™m the cart
if you have providence to excess

out in the snow
That you can see only the back of

I take it out in the snow fall
where you can earn more 

I even know what I would find
If you have confidence regardless all else

even when close to my knowing
a futile joyous white sun

knowing the constituents
the young ripples inaudibly
