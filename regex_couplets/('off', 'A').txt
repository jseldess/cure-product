('off', 'A')

I step off the edge
Arrayed out in such a nested way

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Ask who I am to suspend

So I presume the offers already
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Face falling off the edge of the face
All of the time

off the edge of the world
And as an extension of the values

I am first in the office 
And make myself a visible

Falling off the edge of the face
After having been contented

Coffe and
Attributable or

Where official policy is to catch and release
A turtle fished out of the lake

The value falling off the edge of th face
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

I am the first in the office
THE PLANNING PROCESS

off the end of the world
As an extension of the values

from which to step off
All that I can think I want

Sweets and coffee and juice
Articles all around stores in surfeit

Sweets and coffee
Articles all around us

in the form filled offered in trust
And we could inhabit the room easy

in the form filled offered trust
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

in track as offer asked 
A baby and a bear

who knows how to turn it off
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

Bach helps turn it off
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

I have turned it off
A way I was going

iced coffee and sun position
Aligned or not with my interests

I assume the offers reliable
All that I own messageable

stepping off into the middle
