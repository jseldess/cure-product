('off', 'And')

I step off the edge
And put in place as though stationary

off the edge of the world
And as an extension of the values

I am first in the office 
And make myself a visible

Falling off the edge of the face
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Sweets and coffee and juice
And need out in front purchase

in the form filled offered in trust
And we could inhabit the room easy

in the form filled offered trust
