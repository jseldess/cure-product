('off', 'As')

I step off the edge
Ask who I am

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Ask who I am to suspend

So I presume the offers already
As though stationary and a destination

off the edge of the world
Assimilable or

I am first in the office 
Aspirational strategy

off the end of the world
As an extension of the values

from which to step off
As a clone, illegally conceived

Sweets and coffee and juice
