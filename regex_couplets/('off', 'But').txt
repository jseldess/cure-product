('off', 'but')

I step off the edge
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

Face falling off the edge of the face
but not impart cynicism

off the edge of the world
Attributable or

I am first in the office 
but the sun isn’t up

off the end of the world
but it continued

off the end myself
but it continued rippling muscle

from which to step off
but would I love her the same

falling off the end
but they are black spots

eroded off the end
but I can hear them

Sweets and coffee and juice
that decisions can be attributable

who knows how to turn it off
but for memory elsewhere

iced coffee and sun position
decisions that can be attributable

I assume the offers reliable
revisions that can be attributable

So I presume the offers already
but I own all that’s messageable

stepping off into the middle
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

Or can have seen offering possession
