('off', 'For')

I step off the edge
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

off the edge of the world
Forecasting the story before dawn

Falling off the edge of the face
For an ungraspable time

Sweets and coffee
For an ungraspable purchase

in the form filled offered in trust
For Mitt Romney

in the form filled offered trust
Formerly a way like this one

who knows how to turn it off
Formerly away there are constant ways

in track as offer asked 
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

stepping off into the middle
