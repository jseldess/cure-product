('off', 'if')

I step off the edge
drifting away

Face falling off the edge of the face
if not directly on my skin

off the edge of the world
drifting away needs

I am first in the office 
if you have providence to excess

Coffe and
out of the fifth page ruins

Falling off the edge of the face
learned without too much difficulty to code

I am the first in the office
That company creates a life

from which to step off
Life is with people

off the end of the world
If I take a different measure

falling off the end
If I take some different measure

eroded off the end
if there is anything 

in the form filled offered in trust
if that has anything

in the form filled offered trust
if only on the way to the trash

The offers there already
