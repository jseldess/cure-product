('off', 'IN')

I step off the edge
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

off the edge of the world
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

I am the first in the office
THE PLANNING PROCESS

off the end of the world
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

Sweets and coffee and juice
By NATASHA SINGER

in the form filled offered in trust
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

in track as offer asked 
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

who knows how to turn it off
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

I have turned it off
