('off', 'It')

I step off the edge
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

Face falling off the edge of the face
It keeps coming down thankfully

off the edge of the world
It has been since

I am first in the office 
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

I am the first in the office
It’s morning 

off the end of the world
It’s not marshal exactly

who knows how to turn it off
It’s not marshall exactly

in track as offer asked
