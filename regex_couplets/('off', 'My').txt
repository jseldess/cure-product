('off', 'My')

I step off the edge
My live connections to you

So I presume the offers already
My associations

off the end myself
My purpose up in the sky

Sweets and coffee and juice
My means without gravity

in the form filled offered in trust
My daughter with her way

who knows how to turn it off
My daughter helps too

My daughter turns it off too
My say to the elections

iced coffee and sun position
My interesting politics

I assume the offers reliable
