('off', 'THE')

I step off the edge
THE SNOW

off the edge of the world
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

I am first in the office 
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

I am the first in the office
THE PLANNING PROCESS

off the end of the world
THE OFFERS

falling off the end
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

Sweets and coffee and juice
