('off', 'That')

I step off the edge
That’s exaclty what I want for them

off the edge of the world
That’s where I sleep at times

I am first in the office 
That’s when they really take

Falling off the edge of the face
That you can see only the back of

off the end of the world
That company creates a life

from which to step off
That I captured an afterimage

in the form filled offered in trust
That are my right to say

iced coffee and sun position
