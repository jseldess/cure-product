('off', 'There')

I step off the edge
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

off the edge of the world
There are quarterly goals

I am first in the office 
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Coffe and
There was very little physical activity

off the end myself
There are spots waiting

in the form filled offered in trust
There are constant ways

in track as offer asked
