('off', 'Thou')

I step off the edge
Though there are quarters goals

off the edge of the world
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

off the end of the world
Though in not many acts

Sweets and coffee and juice
Though we are waiting for her

in the form filled offered in trust
Though we are breaking 

in the form filled offered trust
Though we can’t help waiting

My daughter turns it off too
