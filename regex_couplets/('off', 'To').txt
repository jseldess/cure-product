('off', 'To')

I step off the edge
To my children Walt Whitman

off the edge of the world
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

I am first in the office 
To neither study

Coffe and
To that impossible place

Falling off the edge of the face
Tomorrow

I am the first in the office
Toward the start informally given my reasons

Sweets and coffee and juice
To substitute neither study

in the form filled offered in trust
To the ends of transactions

in track as offer asked 
To the ends of my transactions

iced coffee and sun position
To the right of determined elections

I assume the offers reliable
