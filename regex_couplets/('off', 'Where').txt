('off', 'Where')

I step off the edge
Where I sleep at times

So I presume the offers already
Where official policy is to catch and release

off the edge of the world
Where I take my liesure

off the end of the world
Where I lead gravity

in the form filled offered in trust
Where I host my purposes

in the form filled offered trust
Where in me did I loose

in the form filled offered must
Where in me pre-worn

in the form filled offered
Where did I lose trust in me

in track as offer asked
