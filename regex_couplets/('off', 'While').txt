('off', 'while')

I step off the edge
Looking back while I should be sleeping

off the edge of the world
at intervals while riding forward

I am first in the office 
while wrapped in static

Sweets and coffee and juice
while consuming damage

in the form filled offered in trust
I answered while interfaced

iced coffee and sun position
for a while to listen already

So I presume the offers at home already
for a while to listen 

I resume the offers at home
for a while not to listen

presume the offers at 
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

stepping off into the middle
