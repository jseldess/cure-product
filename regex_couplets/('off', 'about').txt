I step off the edge
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

Face falling off the edge of the face
about my childrenâ€™s consumption

value falling off the edge of the face
burrowed about from repeated travels

in the form filled offered in trust
and literally moved about

in the form filled offered trust
answered about 

in the form filled offered must
I answered about

iced coffee and sun position
which I feel formerly about for

I assume the offers reliable
