('off', 'across')

I step off the edge
Before we walk across the wide field

Face falling off the edge of the face
Before we walk across the wide opening

value falling off the edge of the face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

off the edge of the world
across the retinas

off the end myself
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

Sweets and coffee and juice
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

stopping off in all directions
