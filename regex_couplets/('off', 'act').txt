('off', 'act')

I step off the edge
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Face falling off the edge of the face
In the retroactive light

value falling off the edge of the face
of retroactive observations

off the edge of the world
I was enjoined to act again myself

I am first in the office 
I was enjoined to act again

Falling off the edge of the face
and strategies not tactics

off the end of the world
I am bid to act again

off the end myself
I was enjoying acting against myself

off the end
I was enjoined to act

from which to step off
There was very little physical activity

falling off the encoded end
actually considering the end

encoded off the end
I refuse indelible tracts

Sweets and coffee and juice
we had inhabited actually

in the form filled offered in trust
to the ends of my transactions

in the form filled offered trust
To the ends of transactions

in track as offer asked 
to the ends of actions

who knows how to turn it off
the ends of my transactions

My daughter turns it off too
Itâ€™s not marshal exactly

iced coffee and sun position
I return not sad exactly

I assume the offers reliable
before I act on them

So I presume the offers already
