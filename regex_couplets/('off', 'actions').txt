('off', 'actions')

I step off the edge
conversations with our reactions

off the edge of the world
to the ends of my transactions

in the form filled offered in trust
The ends of my transactions

in the form filled offered trust
To the ends of transactions

in track as offer asked 
to the ends of actions

who knows how to turn it off
the other end transactions

iced coffee and sun position
