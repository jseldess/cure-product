('off', 'again')

I step off the edge
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

off the edge of the world
at any time it can drift again

I am first in the office 
I was enjoined to act again myself

Face falling off the edge of the face
I keep turning back again myself

Where official policy is to catch and release
a similar desire against me

Falling off the edge of the face
blue and sun again a second, then night

off the end of the world
I am bid to act again

off the end myself
I was enjoying acting against myself

off the end
I am enjoined to act again

from which to step off
I let it remind me again

in the form filled offered in trust
