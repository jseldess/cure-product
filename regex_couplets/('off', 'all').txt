('off', 'All')

I step off the edge
All of the time

off the edge of the world
All that I can think I want

Sweets and coffee and juice
All parties would be held for my own purchases

in the form filled offered in trust
All parties would be held

in the form filled offered trust
All that I own messageable

stepping off into the middle
