('off', 'along')

I step off the edge
bring your child along

off the edge of the world
The days lined along company

from which to step off
there was no walking along the pleasure

off the end of the world
formerly along time they were on

in track as offer asked 
formerly along my say to the elections

iced coffee and sun position
