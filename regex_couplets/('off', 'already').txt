('off', 'already')

I step off the edge
So I presume the offers already

off the edge of the world
already formerly a long time

in the form filled offered in trust
dawn already formerly nights 

in the form filled offered trust
already brought into privacy

in track as offer asked 
The prospects there already

I presume the offers
The offers there already

stepping off into the middle
So I resume the offers already

I offer to you
for a while to listen already

So I presume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home
