('off', 'any')

I step off the edge
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Face falling off the edge of the face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

off the edge of the world
at any time it can drift again

I am first in the office 
Or the company

Falling off the edge of the face
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

off the end myself
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

off the end of the world
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

off the end
Since I had to hold the entire company

from which to step off
That company creates a life

falling off the encoded end
there wasnâ€™t any television 

falling off the end
not many face up

Sweets and coffee and juice
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

in the form filled offered in trust
if there is anything 

in the form filled offered trust
The many transparent pixel calls

in track as offer asked 
or imagined anyway

I assume the offers reliable
