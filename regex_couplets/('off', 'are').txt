('off', 'are')

I step off the edge
Though there are quarters goals

off the edge of the world
There are quarterly goals

I am first in the office 
barely outlines

I am the first in the office
They are called aspirational

off the end of the world
The days are long

off the end myself
I had nightmares though

from which to step off
but they are black spots

eroded off the end
I believe I can prepare for it

falling off the end of the world
There are spots waiting

in the form filled offered in trust
Though we are waiting for her

in the form filled offered trust
still carefully

in the form filled offered must
There are constant ways

in track as offer asked 
That are my right to say

iced coffee and sun position
careening between the preambles

stepping off into the middle
