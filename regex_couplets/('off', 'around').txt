('off', 'around')

I step off the edge
Spinning around the heart

off the edge of the world
around my country 

Sweets and coffee and juice
articles all around us

Sweets and coffee
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

in the form filled offered in trust
More reasons around my country 

in the form filled offered trust
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

Bach helps turn it off
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

My daughter turns it off too
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

in track as offer asked 
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

iced coffee and sun position
