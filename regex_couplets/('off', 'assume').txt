('off', 'assume')

I step off the edge
I assumed it was visible

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I assumed 

in the form filled offered in trust
I assumed what I draw

in track as offer asked 
I assume the offers reliable

I assume the offers revisitable
I assume the offers divisible

So I presume the offers already
I assumed that they were divisible

stopping off in all directions
I assume possession to others

in school and can see offering
