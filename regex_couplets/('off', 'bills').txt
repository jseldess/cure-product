('off', 'bills')

I step off the edge
between bills and stuffed animals

off the edge of the world
I hear it between bills and stuff

I am first in the office
I can hear it between bills and stuff

from which to step off
I can hear them between bills and stuff

eroded off the end
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

Sweets and coffee and juice
bills and stuffed animals

I presume the offers
