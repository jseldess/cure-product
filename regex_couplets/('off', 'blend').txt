('off', 'blend')

I step off the edge
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Face falling off the edge of the face
walking into percents blending themselves

Sweets and coffee and juice
where I blend and relive

in the form filled offered in trust
where lights blended themselves

in track as offer asked 
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

iced coffee and sun position
