('off', 'brought')

I step off the edge
at home brought into privacy

off the edge of the world
I brought my head down

I am first in the office 
I brought my qualities down

Where official policy is to catch and release
which I brought down with qualities

Falling off the edge of the face
own stays brought loyal

in the form filled offered in trust
own that stays brought loyal

in track as offer asked 
that stays brought loyal

iced coffee and sun position
already brought into privacy

I presume the offers
brought messageable to you

So I presume the offers already
at home brought into private

the offers there already
brought messageable into privacy

I resume the offers at home already
brought into privacy

I resume the offers at home
