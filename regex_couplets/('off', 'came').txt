('off', 'came')

I step off the edge
I invited most of what came next

from which to step off
I came back to me

Sweets and coffee and juice
until the bill came

in the form filled offered in trust
and came home to rewind inflections

So I presume the offers already
and came home to rewind

stepping off into the middle
