('off', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

I step off the edge
I can’t fix them without direction

off the edge of the world
Then I can’t presume to need others

I am first in the office 
That can’t be glimpsed

off the end of the world
Though we can’t help waiting

My daughter turns it off too
I can’t remember them

I assume the offers reliable
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

Or can have seen offering possession
