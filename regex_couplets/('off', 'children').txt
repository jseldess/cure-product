('off', 'children')

I step off the edge
On a snow day with my children

Face falling off the edge of the face
about my childrenâ€™s consumption

value falling off the edge of the face
only fragments of time with my children

off the edge of the world
Even the children

in the form filled offered in trust
my possession of my children

in the form filled offered trust
speech my possession of my children

in track as offer asked
