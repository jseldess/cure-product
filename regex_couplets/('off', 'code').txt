('off', 'code')

I step off the edge
as long as I have access to the code

off the edge of the world
May I have your zip code

I am first in the office 
I spend time online learning to code

Falling off the edge of the face
learned without too much difficulty to code

I am the first in the office
falling off the encoded end

off the end of the world
encoded off the end

hauling off the end of the world
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

in the form filled offered in trust
zipcode

who knows how to turn it off
