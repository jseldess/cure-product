('off', 'come')

I step off the edge
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

Face falling off the edge of the face
Strategy comes before morning

I am the first in the office
after having been contented Strategy comes before morning

off the end of the world
and that man comes on to tell me 

in the form filled offered in trust
and come home to remind inflections

stepping off in to the middle
