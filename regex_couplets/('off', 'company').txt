('off', 'company')

I step off the edge
Or the company

off the edge of the world
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

off the end myself
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

off the end of the world
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

off the end
Since I had to hold the entire company

from which to step off
That company creates a life

falling off the encoded end
