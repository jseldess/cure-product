('off', 'continue')

I step off the edge
but it continued

off the end myself
but it continued rippling muscle

from which to step off
no solid ground to continue along

off the end of the world
I continue to presume

Sweets and coffee and juice
Then I continue to dream then

in the form filled offered in trust
