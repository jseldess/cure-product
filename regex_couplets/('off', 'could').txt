('off', 'could')

I step off the edge
and could be mapped and weighed

off the edge of the world
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

I am first in the office 
until I could not tire 

Sweets and coffee and juice
I could consume the dream

in the form filled offered in trust
And we could inhabit the room easy

in the form filled offered trust
and could be inflected with reasons

So I presume the offers already
