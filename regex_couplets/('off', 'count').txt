('off', 'count')

I step off the edge
Then I constellate my time family country

Face falling off the edge of the face
So I constellate the time family country

Falling off the edge of the face
I brought my count down

off the edge of the world
without the long time I was accounting

off the end of the world
the simple act of honoring an accountant

Sweets and coffee and juice
More reasons around my country 

in the form filled offered in trust
