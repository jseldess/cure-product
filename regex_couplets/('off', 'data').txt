('off', 'data')

I step off the edge
I’ll pull my data higher up

Falling off the edge of the face
I’ll pull my data

Face falling off the edge of the face
The days of private data

from which to step off
The days of public data

off the end of the world
trackers collecting data on users

in the form filled offered in trust
my interfaced stand data

iced coffee and sun position
