('off', 'dawn')

I step off the edge
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Face falling off the edge of the face
Forecasting the story before dawn

Falling off the edge of the face
dawn already formerly nights 

in the form filled offered in trust
dawn formerly

in the form filled offered trust
battery dawn nights 

in track as offer asked 
battery dawn nights ending themselves

iced coffee and sun position
