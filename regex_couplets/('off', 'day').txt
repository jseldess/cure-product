('off', 'day')

I step off the edge
On a snow day with my children

Face falling off the edge of the face
One day there is direction

off the edge of the world
I argued the days felt longer

off the end of the world
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

off the end myself
The days long aligned

off the end
I argued the days were longer

from which to step off
The days were long aligned

falling off the encoded end
The day

in the form filled offered in trust
I have a memory between the day

in the form filled offered trust
at least most days

iced coffee and sun position
