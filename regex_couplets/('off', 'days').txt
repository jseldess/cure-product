('off', 'days')

I step off the edge
I argued the days felt longer

off the end of the world
The days long aligned

off the end myself
I argued the days were longer

off the end
The days aligned for company

from which to step off
The days were long aligned

falling off the encoded end
at least most days

iced coffee and sun position
