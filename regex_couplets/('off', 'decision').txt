('off', 'decision')

I step off the edge
the planning process for decisions

off the end of the world
attributable decisions

Sweets and coffee and juice
forgetting decisions 

in the form filled offered in trust
decisioned to learn 

in track as offer asked 
that decisions can be attributable

who knows how to turn it off
decisioned to learn back

iced coffee and sun position
decisions that can be attributable

I assume the offers reliable
decisioned by the prospect

I presume the offers
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

Or can have seen offering possession
