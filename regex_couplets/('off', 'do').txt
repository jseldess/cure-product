('off', 'do')

I step off the edge
The dogs and lillies

So I presume the offers already
in a sharp downward turn 

Face falling off the edge of the face
In a sharp downard turn

value falling off the edge of the face
It keeps coming down thankfully

off the edge of the world
to the down arrow

I am first in the office 
I brought my head down

Where official policy is to catch and release
I brought my qualities down

Falling off the edge of the face
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

I am the first in the office
What I do in my liesure

off the end of the world
Undoubtedly 

from which to step off
I walk up and don’t work anymore

Sweets and coffee and juice
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

in the form filled offered in trust
and it doesn’t take long

in the form filled offered trust
I only think I don’t listen

stepping off into the middle
