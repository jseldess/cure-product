('off', 'does')

I step off the edge
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

Face falling off the edge of the face
does not feel an exception

off the edge of the world
and it doesn’t take long

in the form filled offered in trust
latency which doesn’t mean anything

in the form filled offered trust
