('off', 'down')

I step off the edge
in a sharp downward turn 

Face falling off the edge of the face
In a sharp downard turn

value falling off the edge of the face
It keeps coming down thankfully

off the edge of the world
to the down arrow

I am first in the office 
I brought my head down

Where official policy is to catch and release
I brought my qualities down

Falling off the edge of the face
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

in the form filled offered in trust
