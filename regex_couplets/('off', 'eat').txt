('off', 'eat')

I step off the edge
too sunny to eat ice cream

Face falling off the edge of the face
I reach repeated expressions first

value falling off the edge of the face
I propogated repeated expressions first

off the edge of the world
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I am first in the office 
executive breath

Falling off the edge of the face
execute breath

The value falling off the edge of the face
was not just a defeat

Coffe and
Where I put it beating

The value falling off the edge of th face
of the habits I create

off the end of the world
of the habits they create.

off the end myself
That company creates a life

from which to step off
it was not just a defeat

Sweets and coffee and juice
And from that great distance

in the form filled offered in trust
for the creation of the universe

in the form filled offered trust
burrowed about from repeated travels

iced coffee and sun position
