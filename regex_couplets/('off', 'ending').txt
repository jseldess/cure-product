('off', 'ending')

I step off the edge
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Face falling off the edge of the face
I tried to feel the key values extending 

off the end of the world
talking into pheasants bending themselves

from which to step off
talking into percents bending themselves

Sweets and coffee and juice
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

in the form filled offered in trust
battery dawn nights ending themselves

iced coffee and sun position
