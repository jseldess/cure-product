('off', 'ends')

I step off the edge
to the ends of my transactions

in the form filled offered in trust
The ends of my transactions

in the form filled offered trust
To the ends of transactions

in track as offer asked 
to the ends of actions

who knows how to turn it off
with her ways to the ends

Bach helps turn it off
with her way to the ends

My daughter turns it off too
The other ends of my transactions

iced coffee and sun position
