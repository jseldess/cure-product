('off', 'enjoined')

I step off the edge
I was enjoined to act again myself

off the edge of the world
I was enjoined to act again

I am first in the office 
I was enjoined to act

off the end of the world
I am enjoined to act again

off the end myself
I was enjoined to act against

from which to step off
