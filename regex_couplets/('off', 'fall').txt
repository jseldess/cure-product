('off', 'fall')

I step off the edge
Then fall then summer from my face

Face falling off the edge of the face
value falling off the edge of the face

off the edge of the world
and not falling at all

I am first in the office 
Then fall then summer

Falling off the edge of the face
The value falling off the edge of the face

I am the first in the office
The value falling off the edge of th face

off the end of the world
falling off the encoded end

from which to step off
I take it out in the snow fall

falling off the end
The first falling syllable

encoded off the end
falling off the end of the world

hauling off the end of the world
falling off the end of the word

Sweets and coffee and juice
