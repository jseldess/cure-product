('off', 'feel')

I step off the edge
conversations with our feelings

off the edge of the world
I tried to feel the key values extending 

off the end of the world
I tried to feel the extension of key values

off the end myself
What would I feel without that goal

from which to step off
But my not feeling the memory aside

in the form filled offered in trust
But my not feeling the memory inside

in the form filled offered trust
which I feel formerly about for

in the form filled offered must
By my feeling the memory inside

in track as offer asked 
But my feeling the memory aside

iced coffee and sun position
