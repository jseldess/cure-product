('off', 'feeling')

I step off the edge
conversations with our feelings

off the edge of the world
But my not feeling the memory aside

in the form filled offered in trust
But my not feeling the memory inside

in the form filled offered trust
By my feeling the memory inside

in track as offer asked 
But my feeling the memory aside

iced coffee and sun position
