('off', 'form')

I step off the edge
There are performance reviews

off the edge of the world
Toward the start informally given my reasons

Sweets and coffee and juice
already formerly a long time

in the form filled offered in trust
dawn already formerly nights 

in the form filled offered trust
which I feel formerly about for

in the form filled offered must
in the form filled offered

in the form help sale offered
in help in the form of a sale offered

in being offered help
formerly along time they were on

in track as offer asked 
A way formerly like this one

who knows how to turn it off
formerly a way

iced coffee and sun position
own best form

I assume the offers reliable
own best form to ourselves

I presume the offers
