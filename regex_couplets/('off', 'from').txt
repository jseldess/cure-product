('off', 'from')

I step off the edge
Then fall then summer from my face

Face falling off the edge of the face
Falling from this distance

value falling off the edge of the face
from the incoming stream

off the edge of the world
Falling from my face

I am first in the office 
A person from a distance

Falling off the edge of the face
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I am the first in the office
Itâ€™s the third letter from the end

off the end of the world
aside from the retinas

off the end myself
from which to step off

falling off the encoded end
promoting from home to a new job

falling off the end
I get from here through there

Sweets and coffee and juice
And from a weak distance

in the form filled offered in trust
breaking from my constituents

in the form filled offered trust
from no one point

iced coffee and sun position
