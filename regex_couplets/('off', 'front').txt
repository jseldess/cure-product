('off', 'front')

I step off the edge
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

off the edge of the world
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

I am first in the office 
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

off the end of the world
in front of the set of regulations

off the end myself
And need out in front purchase

Sweets and coffee and juice
And read out in front

in the form filled offered in trust
behind or out front or up above

I assume the offers reliable
