('off', 'full')

I step off the edge
It keeps coming down thankfully

off the edge of the world
I am full of potential

off the end myself
with full potential to movement

from which to step off
full of aspirations

off the end of the world
full of the missing words

in the form filled offered in trust
still carefully

in the form filled offered trust
