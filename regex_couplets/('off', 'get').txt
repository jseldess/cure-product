('off', 'get')

I step off the edge
I’ll get there eventually

Face falling off the edge of the face
and is relentlessly budgeted

off the edge of the world
I’ll get there ruins

I am first in the office 
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

off the end of the world
I get through there

Sweets and coffee and juice
forgetting decisions 

in the form filled offered in trust
forgettable

I assume the offers revisitable
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

Or can have seen offering possession
and maybe forgettable

I assume the offers divisible
