('off', 'goal')

I step off the edge
Though there are quarters goals

off the edge of the world
There are quarterly goals

I am first in the office 
before morning goals

I am the first in the office
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

off the end of the world
What would I feel without that goal

from which to step off
