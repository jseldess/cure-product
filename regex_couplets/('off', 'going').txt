('off', 'going')

I step off the edge
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Face falling off the edge of the face
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

off the end of the world
The way that she is going

in the form filled offered in trust
The way that I am going

who knows how to turn it off
The way that I was going

Bach helps turn it off
way I was going 

in track as offer asked
