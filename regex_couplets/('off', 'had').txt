('off', 'had')

I step off the edge
If he had not carried one virtue

off the edge of the world
When we had jobs that were to earn

Coffe and
I had me a vision

I am first in the office
Since I had to hold the entire company

off the end of the world
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

from which to step off
I had to tell them the news

falling off the encoded end
The long time I had a vision

falling off the end
I had a vision

Sweets and coffee and juice
We had to say goodbye there

Sweets and coffee
We had to buy there

in the form filled offered in trust
in the space that it had

in the form filled offered trust
I had entered my phone

iced coffee and sun position
