('off', 'has')

I step off the edge
conversations with our purchase

off the edge of the world
It has been since

I am first in the office 
in traversing my purchase

off the end of the world
purchased out

Sweets and coffee and juice
And need out in front purchase

in the form filled offered in trust
if that has anything

in the form filled offered trust
phase decisioned by the prospect

in track as offer asked 
converting sight into a purchase

who knows how to turn it off
He has turned it off

I have turned it off
phase decisioned

iced coffee and sun position
at the site of a purchase

I assume the offers reliable
which as tracked befitted phased

I presume the offers
