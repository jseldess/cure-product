('off', 'have')

I step off the edge
Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning

So I presume the offers already
I have entered my phone

Face falling off the edge of the face
before we can have a retroactive

off the edge of the world
if you have providence to excess

I am first in the office 
If you have confidence regardless all else

Coffe and
May I have your zip code

Where official policy is to catch and release
I have them lost

Sweets and coffee and juice
I have supporters

in the form filled offered in trust
I have a memory between the day

in the form filled offered trust
I have turned it off

in track as offer asked 
I have them trust in me

I assume the offers reliable
I have seen more than I can remember

Or can have seen offering possession
can have seen offering possession

You can have seen offering
