('off', 'Having')

I step off the edge
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I am the first in the office
Having been purchased out of you

Sweets and coffee and juice
Having seen more than 

in the form filled offered in trust
Having seen more than I can remember 

Or can have seen offering possession
