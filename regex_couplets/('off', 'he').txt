('off', 'he')

I step off the edge
into the stream of pictures

We’ll have coffee this morning
Where I sleep at times

So I presume the offers already
The prospects there already

off the edge of the world
Before we walk across the wide field

Face falling off the edge of the face
value falling off the edge of the face

I am first in the office 
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Falling off the edge of the face
Then

The value falling off the edge of the face
over the long time up in the sky

I am the first in the office
to be before the sun

Coffe and
 and time in the train

Where official policy is to catch and release
A turtle fished out of the lake

The value falling off the edge of th face
over the time line I was on

off the end of the world
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

off the end myself
The days long aligned

off the end
I argued the days were longer

from which to step off
And as an extension of the values

falling off the encoded end
but would I love her the same

falling off the end
The first falling syllable

encoded off the end
that I can hear

hauling off the end of the world
The first language

eroded off the end
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

falling off the end of the world
Where I take my liesure

falling off the end of the word
The first track

Sweets and coffee and juice
under the grasp principle

Sweets and coffee
We had to say goodbye there

in the form filled offered in trust
Elsewhere by my memory

in the form filled offered trust
washed by my memory

in the form filled offered must
pre-worn and still wash them

in the form filled offered
in the form help sale offered

in help in the form of a sale offered
in being offered help

in track as offer asked 
bought in the surrounded privacy 

who knows how to turn it off
Though we are waiting for her

Bach helps turn it off
Selma helps too

My daughter turns it off too
the way that I was going

He has turned it off
But my not feeling the memory inside

I have turned it off
to the other end

iced coffee and sun position
I stay the right of my elections

I assume the offers reliable
I assume the offers revisitable

I assume the offers divisible
that they were visible

I presume the offers
by the private preambles

The offers there already
The prospects being seen by me

stepping off into the middle
So I resume the offers already

I offer to you
So I presume the offers

So I presume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home
presume the offers at 

Or can have seen offering possession
I presume to others

and can see offering
The sun high enough to strike directly

stopping off in all directions
I assumed that they were divisible

stepping off in to the middle
I assume possession to others

in school and can see offering
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

seen having or offering possession
