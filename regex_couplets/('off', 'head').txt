('off', 'head')

I step off the edge
Without a head

off the edge of the world
I brought my head down

I am first in the office 
with my head

Where official policy is to catch and release
I search with my head

Falling off the edge of the face
into the next level head

off the end of the world
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

in the form filled offered in trust
