('off', 'hear')

I step off the edge
You can hear it also through your leisure

off the edge of the world
and my heart rate

I am first in the office 
and my heartrate

Falling off the edge of the face
I hear it between bills and stuff

off the end of the world
I can hear it between bills and stuff

from which to step off
that I can hear

falling off the encoded end
as far back as my history heard

eroded off the end
that I hear without trying

falling off the end
I can hear them between bills and stuff

Sweets and coffee and juice
In my heart did I lose trust

in track as offer asked
