('off', 'her')

I step off the edge
Where I sleep at times

So I presume the offers already
The prospects there already

off the edge of the world
I’ll get there eventually

Face falling off the edge of the face
Of course there is a direction

I am first in the office 
I’ll pull myself another personality type

value falling off the edge of the face
There are quarterly goals

Falling off the edge of the face
I’ll pull my data higher up

The value falling off the edge of the face
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Coffe and
Where official policy is to catch and release

The value falling off the edge of th face
there was no promotion

off the end of the world
There was very little physical activity

off the end myself
that potential is there for you

from which to step off
but would I love her the same

falling off the end
Where I take my liesure

eroded off the end
On the other hand

Sweets and coffee and juice
We had to say goodbye there

Sweets and coffee
We had to buy there

in the form filled offered in trust
Elsewhere by my memory

in the form filled offered trust
Where in me did I loose

in the form filled offered must
Where in me pre-worn

in the form filled offered
Where did I lose trust in me

in track as offer asked 
with her waves

who knows how to turn it off
Though we are waiting for her

Bach helps turn it off
with her ways to the ends

My daughter turns it off too
to the other end

iced coffee and sun position
I learned the point where I am

I assume the offers reliable
The offers there already

I presume the offers
traffick is there nonetheless

stepping off into the middle
I presume to others

Or can have seen offering possession
I assume possession to others

in school and can see offering
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

I assume the offers revisitable
