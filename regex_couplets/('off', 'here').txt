('off', 'here')

I step off the edge
Where I sleep at times

So I presume the offers already
The prospects there already

off the edge of the world
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

Face falling off the edge of the face
Of course there is a direction

I am first in the office 
There are quarterly goals

value falling off the edge of the face
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Coffe and
Where official policy is to catch and release

Falling off the edge of the face
there was no promotion

off the end of the world
There was very little physical activity

off the end myself
that potential is there for you

from which to step off
Where I take my liesure

falling off the end
there was no television to hear

Sweets and coffee and juice
We had to say goodbye there

Sweets and coffee
We had to buy there

in the form filled offered in trust
Elsewhere by my memory

in the form filled offered trust
Where in me did I loose

in the form filled offered must
Where in me pre-worn

in the form filled offered
Where did I lose trust in me

in track as offer asked 
Is there a baby and a bear

My daughter turns it off too
There are constant ways

iced coffee and sun position
I learned the point where I am

I assume the offers reliable
The offers there already

I presume the offers
traffick is there nonetheless

stepping off into the middle
