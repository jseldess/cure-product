('off', 'high')

I step off the edge
way high up in the inter

Falling off the edge of the face
I’ll pull my data higher up

Face falling off the edge of the face
higher up in the results

off the edge of the world
high in the content architecture

I am first in the office
I’ll pull myself higher up

The value falling off the edge of th face
your bid to the next highest ranked network

off the end of the world
The sun high enough to enter directly 

Sweets and coffee and juice
The sun high enough to strike directly

stopping off in all directions
