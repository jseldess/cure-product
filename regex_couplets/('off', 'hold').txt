('off', 'hold')

I step off the edge
I take hold of my finger

Coffe and
When they really take hold of my finger

off the edge of the world
hold at intervals riding forward

I am first in the office 
Since I had to hold the entire company

off the end of the world
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

from which to step off
and hold and wish to hold

Sweets and coffee and juice
designed to hold up my underwear

in the form filled offered in trust
