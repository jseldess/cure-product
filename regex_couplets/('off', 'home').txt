('off', 'home')

I step off the edge
at home brought into privacy

off the edge of the world
promoting from home to a new job

off the end of the world
that agreed home

I assume the offers reliable
and came home to rewind inflections

So I presume the offers already
So I find myself at home

in track as offer asked 
So I found myself at home

The offers there already
at home brought into private

I presume the offers
at home visions can be attainable

I offer to you
So I presume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home

presume the offers at 
and came home to rewind

stepping off into the middle
and come home to remind inflections

stepping off in to the middle
