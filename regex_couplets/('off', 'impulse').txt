('off', 'impulse')

I step off the edge
impulse control

off the edge of the world
I send and retrieve the impulse

in the form filled offered in trust
I stand and retrieve the impulse

in the form filled offered trust
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

in track as offer asked 
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

iced coffee and sun position
