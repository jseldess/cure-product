('off', 'inter')

I step off the edge
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Face falling off the edge of the face
interjecting on a day ambition

off the edge of the world
way high up in the inter

Falling off the edge of the face
higher up in the internet

The value falling off the edge of the face
hold at intervals riding forward

I am first in the office 
at intervals while riding forward

The value falling off the edge of th face
with internally regulated climate

off the end of the world
Then I saw them interview

Sweets and coffee and juice
my interfaced stand data

iced coffee and sun position
My interesting politics

I assume the offers reliable
