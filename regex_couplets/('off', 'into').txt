('off', 'into')

I step off the edge
into rotating directionless 

We’ll have coffee this morning
into the stream of pictures

So I presume the offers already
at home brought into privacy

off the edge of the world
into the minority proportion of time

Face falling off the edge of the face
interjecting into the stream

I am first in the office 
into a brigand and a murderer

Coffe and
into the well controlled climate

off the end of the world
talking into pheasants bending themselves

from which to step off
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

Sweets and coffee and juice
Then I saw into you

in the form filled offered in trust
deep into pathways from repeated travels

in the form filled offered trust
stopping into the prospect

in track as offer asked 
converting sight into a purchase

who knows how to turn it off
step by into the prospect

iced coffee and sun position
into liminal reflexing

I assume the offers reliable
already brought into privacy

I presume the offers
at home brought into private

the offers there already
stepping off into the middle

So I resume the offers already
brought messageable into privacy

I resume the offers at home already
brought into privacy

I resume the offers at home
