('off', 'joy')

I step off the edge
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

Face falling off the edge of the face
I was enjoying acting against myself

off the end of the world
a futile joyous white sun

Sweets and coffee and juice
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

in the form filled offered in trust
