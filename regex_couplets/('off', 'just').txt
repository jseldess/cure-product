('off', 'just')

I step off the edge
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

off the edge of the world
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I am first in the office 
was not just a defeat

Coffe and
I just got a letter

off the end of the world
it was not just a defeat

Sweets and coffee and juice
