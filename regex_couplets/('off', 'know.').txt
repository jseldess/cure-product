('off', 'know.')

I step off the edge
who knows the way

Face falling off the edge of the face
how can I know without direction

off the edge of the world
I even know what I would find

falling off the end of the world
even when close to my knowing

Sweets and coffee and juice
knowing the constituents

in the form filled offered in trust
who knows how to turn it off

Bach helps turn it off
who know the ways to their other end

in track as offer asked 
that their knowing

I assume the offers reliable
