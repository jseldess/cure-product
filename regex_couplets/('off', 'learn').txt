('off', 'learn')

I step off the edge
in light of learning what we see

off the edge of the world
I spend time online learning to code

I am first in the office 
learned without too much difficulty to code

I am the first in the office
decisioned to learn 

in the form filled offered in trust
decisioned to learn back

in track as offer asked 
phase decision for learning

iced coffee and sun position
I learned my location

I assume the offers reliable
for learning by the prospect

I presume the offers
