('off', 'learning')

I step off the edge
in light of learning what we see

off the edge of the world
I spend time online learning to code

I am first in the office 
Then I am learning to code

I am the first in the office
phase decision for learning

in track as offer asked 
for learning by the prospect

iced coffee and sun position
a precision for learning

I presume the offers
