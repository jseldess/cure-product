('off', 'light')

I step off the edge
variegated reflected light

Face falling off the edge of the face
In the retroactive light

value falling off the edge of the face
In the light of retroactive conversations

off the edge of the world
stopped light with validated fields

in the form filled offered must
where lights blended themselves

in track as offer asked 
stopped light with validated faces

iced coffee and sun position
