('off', 'live')

I step off the edge
I upend live connections to you

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I suspend live connections to you

So I presume the offers already
Which is a measure to never live out

off the edge of the world
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I am first in the office 
Which is a pleasure to never live out

Sweets and coffee and juice
where I send and relive aside

in the form filled offered in trust
Where I stand and relive

in the form filled offered trust
where I send and relive

iced coffee and sun position
