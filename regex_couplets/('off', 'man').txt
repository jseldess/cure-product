('off', 'man')

I step off the edge
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

Face falling off the edge of the face
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

off the edge of the world
There are performance reviews

I am first in the office 
not many face up

Sweets and coffee and juice
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

in the form filled offered in trust
They have very many choices

in the form filled offered trust
The many transparent pixel calls

in track as offer asked
