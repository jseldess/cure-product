('off', 'may')

I step off the edge
may not be ingrained

off the end of the world
may not be engrained

eroded off the end
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

in the form filled offered in trust
and maybe regrettable 

I assume the offers revisitable
and maybe forgettable

I assume the offers divisible
