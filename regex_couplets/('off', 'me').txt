('off', 'me')

I step off the edge
I assumed it was visible

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Where I sleep at times

So I presume the offers already
at home brought into privacy

off the edge of the world
Then I constellate my time family country

Face falling off the edge of the face
Then fall then summer

value falling off the edge of the face
When I want something

I am first in the office 
over the long time up in the sky

Falling off the edge of the face
on the time line I was on

The value falling off the edge of the face
over the time line I was on

I am the first in the office
So I constellate the time family country

Coffe and
 and time in the train

Where official policy is to catch and release
Some disease effecting the tree out front

The value falling off the edge of th face
over the long time I was on

off the end of the world
I had me a vision

off the end myself
since I can imagine movement

from which to step off
with full potential to movement

falling off the encoded end
but would I love her the same

falling off the end
I resume unassimilable visions

eroded off the end
will not be the same

falling off the end of the world
in the time

encoded off the end
If I take a different measure

Sweets and coffee and juice
For an ungraspable time

Sweets and coffee
And for an ungraspable time

in the form filled offered in trust
Elsewhere by my memory

in the form filled offered trust
washed by my memory

in the form filled offered must
Where in me pre-worn

in the form filled offered
Where did I lose trust in me

in track as offer asked 
A way formerly like this one

who knows how to turn it off
But my not feeling the memory inside

Bach helps turn it off
Formerly a way like this one

iced coffee and sun position
which I feel formerly about for

I assume the offers reliable
in that I cannot remember 

I assume the offers revisitable
I assume the offers divisible

I presume the offers
brought messageable to you

The offers there already
The prospects being seen by me

stepping off into the middle
So I resume the offers already

I offer to you
So I presume the offers

So I presume the offers at home already
brought messageable into privacy

I resume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home

presume the offers at 
in privacy that is messageable

Or can have seen offering possession
I presume to others

and can see offering
I assumed that they were divisible

stopping off in all directions
and come home to remind inflections

stepping off in to the middle
I assume possession to others

in school and can see offering
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

seen having or offering possession
