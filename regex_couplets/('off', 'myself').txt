('off', 'myself')

I step off the edge
So I find myself at home

off the edge of the world
But I can’t let myself treat 

I am first in the office 
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Face falling off the edge of the face
I was enjoined to act again myself

value falling off the edge of the face
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

Falling off the edge of the face
And make myself a visible

The value falling off the edge of the face
I keep turning back again myself

Where official policy is to catch and release
I’ll pull myself higher up

The value falling off the edge of th face
off the end myself

off the end of the world
I was bid to act again myself

off the end
I was enjoying acting against myself

from which to step off
myself

in the form filled offered in trust
the least productive of myself

iced coffee and sun position
So I found myself at home

The offers there already
