('off', 'need')

I step off the edge
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

off the edge of the world
drifting away needs

I am first in the office 
I need the work

Sweets and coffee and juice
And need out in front purchase

in the form filled offered in trust
not needing to wait

in the form filled offered trust
in need one in that best own

in track as offer asked 
need one in best own

iced coffee and sun position
that in need one best own

I presume the offers
