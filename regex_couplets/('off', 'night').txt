('off', 'night')

I step off the edge
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

off the edge of the world
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Face falling off the edge of the face
blue and sun again a second, then night

off the end of the world
I had nightmares though

from which to step off
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Sweets and coffee and juice
dawn already formerly nights 

in the form filled offered in trust
last night

in the form filled offered trust
battery dawn nights 

in track as offer asked 
battery dawn nights ending themselves

iced coffee and sun position
