('off', 'no')

I step off the edge
into the minority proportion of time

We’ll have coffee this morning
Then I cannot see face value

off the edge of the world
On a snow day with my children

Face falling off the edge of the face
and not falling at all

value falling off the edge of the face
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

I am first in the office 
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Falling off the edge of the face
Right now I’m the cart

The value falling off the edge of the face
by no ventillation my purpose

I am the first in the office
I am told by no ventillation

Coffe and
In a vertiginous dream

Where official policy is to catch and release
in a continuous vertiginous dream

The value falling off the edge of th face
over the long line I would honor

off the end of the world
in front of the set afternoon

off the end myself
that their economic value 

off the end
there was no promotion

from which to step off
I take it out in the snow fall

falling off the end
may not be ingrained

eroded off the end
may not be engrained

falling off the end of the world
I even know what I would find

falling off the encoded end
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

Sweets and coffee and juice
I used my technology

in the form filled offered in trust
The sun high enough to enter directly

in the form filled offered trust
who knows the way

in the form filled offered must
But my not feeling the memory inside

who knows how to turn it off
Selma knows too 

Bach helps turn it off
It’s not marshal exactly

in track as offer asked 
not literally moved about

iced coffee and sun position
Aligned or not with my interests

I assume the offers reliable
in that I cannot remember 

I assume the offers revisitable
which is not necessarily possible

So I presume the offers already
for a while not to listen

presume the offers at 
traffick is there nonetheless

stepping off into the middle
The sun high enough to strike directly

stopping off in all directions
