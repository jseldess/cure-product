('off', 'nor')

I step off the edge
into the minority proportion of time

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
over the long line I would honor

I am first in the office
nor work in this way daily

Coffe and
the simple act of honoring an accountant

Sweets and coffee and juice
nor envy honest work

in the form filled offered in trust
which had on honor to be told

in the form filled offered trust
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

in track as offer asked
