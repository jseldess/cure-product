('off', 'now')

I step off the edge
On a snow day with my children

Face falling off the edge of the face
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

off the edge of the world
Right now I’m the cart

value falling off the edge of the face
out in the snow

I am first in the office
out in the snow fall

off the end of the world
I take it out in the snow fall

from which to step off
I even know what I would find

falling off the end of the world
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

Sweets and coffee and juice
knowing the constituents

in the form filled offered in trust
who knows the way

in the form filled offered must
who knows how to turn it off

Bach helps turn it off
who know the ways to their other end

in track as offer asked 
that their knowing

I assume the offers reliable
