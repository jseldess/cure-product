('off', 'other')

I step off the edge
I’ll pull myself another personality type

off the edge of the world
others desires

I am first in the office 
Then I can’t presume to need others

Face falling off the edge of the face
On the other hand

Sweets and coffee and juice
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

in the form filled offered in trust
and other types of tracking technology

in the form filled offered trust
I presume to others

in track as offer asked 
to the other end

who knows how to turn it off
the other end transactions

iced coffee and sun position
I assume possession to others

in school and can see offering
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

I assume the offers reliable
