('off', 'others')

I step off the edge
others desires

off the edge of the world
Then I can’t presume to need others

I am first in the office 
I presume to others

in the form filled offered in trust
Cereal and others’ health

iced coffee and sun position
I assume possession to others

in school and can see offering
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

I assume the offers reliable
