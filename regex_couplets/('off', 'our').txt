('off', 'our')

I step off the edge
reasons resources

Face falling off the edge of the face
conversations with our purchase

off the edge of the world
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling off the edge of the face
Two hours and

I am first in the office 
or an available resource

The value falling off the edge of th face
with four key value pairs

off the end of the world
or alter of course the time anyway

in the form filled offered in trust
This is your voice 

in the form filled offered trust
Who throws contours away

in track as offer asked 
phrase them of our possessions

I assume the offers reliable
own best form to ourselves

I presume the offers
