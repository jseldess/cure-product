('off', 'over')

I step off the edge
I step over the edge

off the edge of the world
over the long time up in the sky

I am first in the office 
over the time line I was on

I am the first in the office
over the long line up in the sky

Coffe and
hovering above standing water

Falling off the edge of the face
over the long line I would honor

off the end of the world
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

Sweets and coffee and juice
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

in the form filled offered in trust
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

in the form filled offered trust
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

stopping off in all directions
