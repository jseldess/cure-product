('off', 'own')

I step off the edge
in a sharp downward turn 

Face falling off the edge of the face
In a sharp downard turn

value falling off the edge of the face
It keeps coming down thankfully

off the edge of the world
to the down arrow

I am first in the office 
I brought my head down

Where official policy is to catch and release
I brought my qualities down

Falling off the edge of the face
oddly grown over with historic bark

off the end of the world
even when close to my owning

Sweets and coffee and juice
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

in the form filled offered in trust
the impulse for my own prospects

in the form filled offered trust
own stays brought loyal

in track as offer asked 
in need one in that best own

iced coffee and sun position
for my own purposes

I assume the offers reliable
own best form to ourselves

I presume the offers
All that I own messageable

stepping off into the middle
