('off', 'point')

I step off the edge
But that is beside the point

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Whereas direction is beside the point

So I presume the offers already
from no one point

in the form filled offered in trust
the point where I am

iced coffee and sun position
I learned my point

I assume the offers reliable
