('off', 'possession')

I step off the edge
I speak to them my possessions

in the form filled offered in trust
my possession of my children

in track as offer asked 
I speak them of my possessions

who knows how to turn it off
speech my possession of my children

iced coffee and sun position
I stay the right of my possessions 

I assume the offers reliable
phrase them of our possessions

I presume the offers
Or can have seen offering possession

and can see offering
seen having or offering possession

can have seen offering possession
I assume possession to others

in school and can see offering
