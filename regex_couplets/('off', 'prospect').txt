('off', 'prospect')

I step off the edge
The prospects there already

off the edge of the world
the impulse for my own prospects

in the form filled offered in trust
the impulse my own prospects

in the form filled offered trust
stopping into the prospect

in track as offer asked 
speech that is of by prospects

iced coffee and sun position
decisioned by the prospect

I presume the offers
the prospects being seen by me

The offers there already
The prospect of seeing healthily 

So I presume the offers already
The prospect for careening attached

stepping off into the middle
