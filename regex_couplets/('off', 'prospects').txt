('off', 'prospects')

I step off the edge
The prospects there already

off the edge of the world
the impulse for my own prospects

in the form filled offered in trust
the impulse my own prospects

in the form filled offered trust
speech that is of by prospects

in track as offer asked 
the prospects being seen by me

The offers there already
