('off', 'pulse')

I step off the edge
impulse control

off the edge of the world
I send and retrieve the impulse

in the form filled offered in trust
I stand and retrieve the impulse

in the form filled offered trust
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

Bach helps turn it off
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

My daughter turns it off too
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

in track as offer asked 
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

iced coffee and sun position
