('off', 'purpose')

I step off the edge
by no ventillation my purpose

I am the first in the office
until my purpose up in the sky

I am first in the office
until I purpose the horizon

Sweets and coffee and juice
Until my purpose 

in the form filled offered in trust
Where I host my purposes

in the form filled offered trust
to the other end of my purpose

in track as offer asked 
the impulse for my own purposes

iced coffee and sun position
for my own purposes

I assume the offers reliable
