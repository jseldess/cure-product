('off', 'rate')

I step off the edge
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

Face falling off the edge of the face
and my heart rate

off the edge of the world
and my heartrate

I am first in the office 
Strategy comes before morning

I am the first in the office
after having been contented Strategy comes before morning

off the end of the world
I aspirate with little vision

from which to step off
