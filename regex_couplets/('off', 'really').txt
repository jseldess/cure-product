('off', 'really')

I step off the edge
because it was really dark

Face falling off the edge of the face
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

off the edge of the world
When they really take hold of my finger

I am first in the office 
That’s when they really take

Falling off the edge of the face
without really agreeing

in the form filled offered in trust
without really speaking

in the form filled offered trust
also didn’t really move

iced coffee and sun position
