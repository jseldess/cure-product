('off', 'reasons')

I step off the edge
reasons resources

Face falling off the edge of the face
with reasons

Coffe and
with little reasons to aspiration

off the end myself
with little reasons to move

from which to step off
Toward the start informally given my reasons

Sweets and coffee and juice
More reasons around my country 

in the form filled offered in trust
and could be inflected with reasons

So I presume the offers already
