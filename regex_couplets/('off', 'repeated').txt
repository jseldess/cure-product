('off', 'repeated')

I step off the edge
I reach repeated expressions first

Face falling off the edge of the face
I propogated repeated expressions first

off the edge of the world
burrowed about from repeated travels

in the form filled offered in trust
deep into pathways from repeated travels

iced coffee and sun position
