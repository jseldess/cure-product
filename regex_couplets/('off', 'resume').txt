('off', 'resume')

I step off the edge
So I presume the offers already

off the edge of the world
and can’t presume to need

I am first in the office 
Then I can’t presume to need others

Face falling off the edge of the face
I resume unassimilable visions

off the end of the world
I resume indelible tracks

Sweets and coffee and juice
I presume to others

in the form filled offered in trust
I presume the offers

The offers there already
So I resume the offers already

I offer to you
So I presume the offers

So I presume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home
I resume at home

presume the offers at 
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

I assume the offers reliable
