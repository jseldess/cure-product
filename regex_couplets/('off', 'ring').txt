('off', 'ring')

I step off the edge
interferring 

off the edge of the world
ring

I am first in the office 
hovering above standing water

Falling off the edge of the face
actually considering the end

falling off the encoded end
the simple act of honoring an accountant

Sweets and coffee and juice
storing in surfeit

Sweets and coffee
firing and connecting somewhere

in the form filled offered in trust
The prospect for veering healthily

stepping off into the middle
Or can have seen offering possession

and can see offering
seen having or offering possession

can have seen offering possession
You can have seen offering

in school and can see offering
