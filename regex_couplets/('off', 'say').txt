('off', 'say')

I step off the edge
we had to say goodbye

Sweets and coffee and juice
We had to say goodbye there

Sweets and coffee
And we had to say goodbye to her there

in the form filled offered in trust
I ask say in that case

in the form filled offered trust
we ask say in that case

in track as offer asked 
formerly along my say to the elections

iced coffee and sun position
I ask say in that phase decisioned

I presume the offers
