('off', 'see')

I step off the edge
Then I cannot see face value

off the edge of the world
such as I see

I am first in the office 
If I let myself see others desires

Face falling off the edge of the face
where I can claim to see the ruins

Falling off the edge of the face
I see only the back of falling values

off the end of the world
under the last seen principle

Sweets and coffee and juice
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

in the form filled offered in trust
Having seen more than 

in the form filled offered trust
being seen by me

The offers there already
The prospects being seen by me

So I presume the offers already
The prospect for seeing healthily

stepping off into the middle
Having seen more than I can remember 

Or can have seen offering possession
and can see offering

stopping off in all directions
seen having or offering possession

can have seen offering possession
You can have seen offering

in school and can see offering
