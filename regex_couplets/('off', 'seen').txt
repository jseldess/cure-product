('off', 'seen')

I step off the edge
under the last seen principle

Sweets and coffee and juice
Having seen more than 

in the form filled offered in trust
being seen by me

The offers there already
The prospects being seen by me

So I presume the offers already
Having seen more than I can remember 

Or can have seen offering possession
seen having or offering possession

can have seen offering possession
You can have seen offering

in school and can see offering
