('off', 'set')

I step off the edge
upset by Gingrich

off the edge of the world
in front of the set afternoon

off the end of the world
in front of the set of regulations

off the end myself
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

in the form filled offered in trust
Um, upset by Gingrich

in the form filled offered trust
presets

I assume the offers reliable
