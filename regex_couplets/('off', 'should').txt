('off', 'should')

I step off the edge
You should ask who I am

So I presume the offers already
While I should be sleeping

off the edge of the world
Looking back while I should be sleeping

I am first in the office 
While I should sleep not back in the results

Falling off the edge of the face
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

in the form filled offered in trust
they should rise up

in the form filled offered trust
