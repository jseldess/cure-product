('off', 'side')

I step off the edge
But that is beside the point

We’ll have coffee this morning
Whereas direction is beside the point

So I presume the offers already
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Face falling off the edge of the face
I’m simply inside

off the edge of the world
aside from the retinas

off the end myself
actually considering the end

falling off the encoded end
But my not feeling the memory aside

in the form filled offered in trust
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

in the form filled offered trust
But my not feeling the memory inside

who knows how to turn it off
By my feeling the memory inside

in track as offer asked 
where I send and relive aside

iced coffee and sun position
