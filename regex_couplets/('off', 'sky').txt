('off', 'sky')

I step off the edge
over the long time up in the sky

off the edge of the world
over the long line up in the sky

I am first in the office
Blue sky or

Where official policy is to catch and release
until my purpose up in the sky

I am the first in the office
though not many facts up in the sky

Sweets and coffee and juice
My purpose up in the sky

in the form filled offered in trust
