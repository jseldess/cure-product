('off', 'sleep')

I step off the edge
Where I sleep at times

So I presume the offers already
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Face falling off the edge of the face
That’s where I sleep at times

off the edge of the world
Interrupted sleep or

I am first in the office 
While I should be sleeping

Where official policy is to catch and release
Looking back while I should be sleeping

Falling off the edge of the face
like flattening sleep 

Sweets and coffee and juice
