('off', 'stand')

I step off the edge
hovering above standing water

off the edge of the world
I stand and retrieve the impulse

in the form filled offered in trust
Where I stand and relive

in the form filled offered trust
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

Bach helps turn it off
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

My daughter turns it off too
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

in track as offer asked 
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

iced coffee and sun position
I learned the point of standing

I assume the offers reliable
