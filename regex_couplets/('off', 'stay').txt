('off', 'stay')

I step off the edge
wrestling to stay still

off the edge of the world
So stay with us

from which to step off
own stays brought loyal

in the form filled offered in trust
own that stays brought loyal

in track as offer asked 
that stays brought loyal

iced coffee and sun position
I stay the right of my elections

I assume the offers reliable
home stays brought loyal

I presume the offers
