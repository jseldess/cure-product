('off', 'step')

I step off the edge
I step over the edge

off the edge of the world
What the next step

off the end of the world
from which to step off

falling off the encoded end
step in by the prospect

in track as offer asked 
phase decision step in

iced coffee and sun position
step by into the prospect

I presume the offers
stepping in the middle

stepping off into the middle
stepping off in to the middle

Or can have seen offering possession
