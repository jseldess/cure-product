('off', 'still')

I step off the edge
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Face falling off the edge of the face
That is itself not still

off the edge of the world
I love my daughter still

off the end of the world
though we are still breaking in

in the form filled offered in trust
still wash conserving

in the form filled offered trust
so still them

in the form filled offered must
pre-worn and still wash them

in the form filled offered
