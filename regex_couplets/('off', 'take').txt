('off', 'take')

I step off the edge
I take hold of my finger

Coffe and
When they really take hold of my finger

off the edge of the world
That’s when they really take

I am first in the office 
If I take a different measure

off the end of the world
If I take some different measure

falling off the end
Where I take my liesure

eroded off the end
I take it out in the snow fall

falling off the end of the world
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

Sweets and coffee and juice
to take the call

in the form filled offered in trust
and it doesn’t take long

iced coffee and sun position
