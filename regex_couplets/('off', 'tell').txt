('off', 'tell')

I step off the edge
Then I constellate my time family country

Face falling off the edge of the face
So I constellate the time family country

Falling off the edge of the face
I constellate the time

Coffe and
The CEO tells me to embody values

off the edge of the world
I had to tell them the news

from which to step off
I tell you my purposes

in the form filled offered in trust
and that man comes on to tell me 

in the form filled offered trust
