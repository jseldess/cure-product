('off', 'their')

I step off the edge
We can wrestle them with their goals

off the edge of the world
I am not allowed to see their face

off the end of the world
that their economic value 

off the end myself
without their agreement

in the form filled offered in trust
to their other end

in track as offer asked 
that their knowing

I assume the offers reliable
