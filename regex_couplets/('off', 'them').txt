('off', 'them')

I step off the edge
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Face falling off the edge of the face
Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them

off the edge of the world
In a continuous theme

I am first in the office 
or argued for them at least

off the end myself
I had to tell them the news

from which to step off
talking into pheasants bending themselves

off the end of the world
I can hear them between bills and stuff

eroded off the end
but I can hear them

Sweets and coffee and juice
I designed them to hold up my underwear

in the form filled offered in trust
Then I saw them interview

in the form filled offered trust
pre-worn and still wash them

in the form filled offered must
so still watch them

in the form filled offered
I speak them of my possessions

in track as offer asked 
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

iced coffee and sun position
abjure them with determining 

I assume the offers reliable
before I act on them

So I presume the offers already
phrase them of our possessions

I presume the offers
