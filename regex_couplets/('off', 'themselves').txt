('off', 'themselves')

I step off the edge
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Face falling off the edge of the face
talking into pheasants bending themselves

off the end of the world
talking into percents bending themselves

Sweets and coffee and juice
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

in the form filled offered in trust
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

in track as offer asked 
battery dawn nights ending themselves

iced coffee and sun position
