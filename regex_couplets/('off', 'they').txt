('off', 'They')

I step off the edge
Theyâ€™re just not mine

off the edge of the world
They are called aspirational

off the end of the world
They can be waived

in the form filled offered in trust
They have very many choices

in the form filled offered trust
They were filters

iced coffee and sun position
