('off', 'time.')

I step off the edge
Where I sleep at times

So I presume the offers already
Then I constellate my time family country

Face falling off the edge of the face
only fragments of time with my children

off the edge of the world
over the long time up in the sky

I am first in the office 
So I constellate the time family country

Falling off the edge of the face
on the time line I was on

The value falling off the edge of the face
over the time line I was on

I am the first in the office
 and time in the train

Where official policy is to catch and release
I spend time online learning to code

The value falling off the edge of th face
over the long time I was on

off the end of the world
The long time I had a vision

from which to step off
without the long time I was accounting

falling off the end
The long time I was a vision

Sweets and coffee and juice
or alter of course the time anyway

in the form filled offered in trust
formerly a long time they were on

in the form filled offered trust
formerly along time they were on

in track as offer asked 
time they were on

iced coffee and sun position
in the long time they were on

I assume the offers reliable
