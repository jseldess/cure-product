('off', 'tire')

I step off the edge
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

off the end of the world
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

off the end myself
The entire company

off the end
Since I had to hold the entire company

from which to step off
until I could not tire 

Sweets and coffee and juice
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

in the form filled offered in trust
