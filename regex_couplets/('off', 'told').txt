('off', 'told')

I step off the edge
I told her a story, she drew waves.

Face falling off the edge of the face
I am told ventillation

Falling off the edge of the face
I am told by no ventillation

I am first in the office
I am told by the ventillation

I am the first in the office
which ran to be told

in the form filled offered in trust
