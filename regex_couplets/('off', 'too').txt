('off', 'too')

I step off the edge
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

Face falling off the edge of the face
emerging this year from too much standing water

off the edge of the world
learned without too much difficulty to code

I am the first in the office
Selma knows too 

Bach helps turn it off
Selma helps too

My daughter turns it off too
