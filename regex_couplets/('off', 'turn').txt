('off', 'turn')

I step off the edge
in a sharp downward turn 

Face falling off the edge of the face
In a sharp downard turn

value falling off the edge of the face
sudden downward turn

off the edge of the world
I keep turning back again myself

I am first in the office 
I keep turning back

Falling off the edge of the face
who knows how to turn it off

Bach helps turn it off
My daughter turns it off too

He has turned it off
I have turned it off

in track as offer asked 
I turn not sad exactly

iced coffee and sun position
I return not sad exactly

I assume the offers reliable
