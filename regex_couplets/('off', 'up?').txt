('off', 'up?')

I step off the edge
I assumed it was visible

We’ll have coffee this morning
Arrayed out in such a nested way

So I presume the offers already
at home brought into privacy

off the edge of the world
I’ll get there eventually

Face falling off the edge of the face
value falling off the edge of the face

I am first in the office 
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Falling off the edge of the face
The value falling off the edge of the face

I am the first in the office
to be before the sun

Coffe and
Blue sky or

Where official policy is to catch and release
A turtle fished out of the lake

The value falling off the edge of th face
over the long time up in the sky

off the end of the world
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

off the end myself
I argued the days were longer

off the end
And as an extension of the values

from which to step off
The days of quantity 

falling off the encoded end
white spots on a black surface

falling off the end
First language

hauling off the end of the world
The first language

eroded off the end
black spots on a white surface

falling off the end of the world
I reuse indelible tracks 

encoded off the end
actually considering the end

Sweets and coffee and juice
For an ungraspable time

Sweets and coffee
 and juice

in the form filled offered in trust
all parties would be held

in the form filled offered trust
answered about 

in the form filled offered must
 still carefully

in the form filled offered
In my heart did I lose trust

in track as offer asked 
bought in the surrounded privacy 

who knows how to turn it off
Though we are waiting for her

Bach helps turn it off
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

My daughter turns it off too
He has turned it off

I have turned it off
I end up Bach

iced coffee and sun position
which I feel formerly about for

I assume the offers reliable
I assume the offers revisitable

I assume the offers divisible
I assumed 

I presume the offers
revisions that can be attributable

The offers there already
at home brought into private

stepping off into the middle
So I resume the offers already

I offer to you
So I presume the offers

So I presume the offers at home already
brought messageable into privacy

I resume the offers at home already
brought into privacy

I resume the offers at home
I resume at home

presume the offers at 
but I own all that’s messageable

Or can have seen offering possession
I presume to others

and can see offering
The sun high enough to strike directly

stopping off in all directions
I assumed that they were divisible

stepping off in to the middle
You can have seen offering

in school and can see offering
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

seen having or offering possession
I assume possession to others
