('off', 'us')

I step off the edge
I suspend live connections to you

So I presume the offers already
asynchronous 

Face falling off the edge of the face
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

off the edge of the world
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I am first in the office 
I want to cite a poem so usual

Coffe and
In a vertiginous dream

Where official policy is to catch and release
in a continuous vertiginous dream

Falling off the edge of the face
The ventillation rushes on

I am the first in the office
I just got a letter

off the end of the world
So stay with us

from which to step off
but it continued rippling muscle

falling off the encoded end
I reuse unassimilable visions

falling off the end
I reuse indelible tracks

eroded off the end
I refuse indelible tracts

Sweets and coffee and juice
articles all around us

Sweets and coffee
I wear suspenders

in the form filled offered in trust
was not just a defeat

in the form filled offered trust
in the form filled offered must

in the form filled offered
In my heart did I lose trust

in track as offer asked 
radiating from housing

iced coffee and sun position
I have them trust in me

I assume the offers reliable
