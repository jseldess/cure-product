('off', 'use')

I step off the edge
because it was really dark

Face falling off the edge of the face
You use the most essential parts

off the edge of the world
I reuse unassimilable visions

off the end of the world
because there was no solid ground to continue along

falling off the end
I reuse indelible tracks

eroded off the end
I refuse indelible tracts

Sweets and coffee and juice
I used my technology

in the form filled offered in trust
trackers collecting data on users

in the form filled offered trust
