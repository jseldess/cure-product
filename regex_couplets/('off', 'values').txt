('off', 'values')

I step off the edge
And as an extension of the values

off the edge of the world
The CEO tells me to embody values

I am first in the office 
I see only the back of falling values

off the end of the world
I tried to feel the key values extending 

off the end myself
As an extension of the values

from which to step off
