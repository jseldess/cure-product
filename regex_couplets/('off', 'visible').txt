('off', 'visible')

I step off the edge
I assumed it was visible

We’ll have coffee this morning
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

Face falling off the edge of the face
And make myself a visible

Falling off the edge of the face
Divisible or

off the edge of the world
I assume the offers divisible

So I presume the offers already
that they were divisible

stepping off into the middle
I assumed that they were divisible

stopping off in all directions
