('off', 'visions')

I step off the edge
The planning process for visions

off the end of the world
aspirating visions

off the end myself
aspirating with visions

off the end
embodied with little visions

from which to step off
aspirating with little visions

falling off the encoded end
I reuse unassimilable visions

falling off the end
I resume unassimilable visions

eroded off the end
I resume attributable visions

Sweets and coffee and juice
visions that can be attainable

I presume the offers
revisions that can be attributable

So I presume the offers already
at home visions can be attainable

I offer to you
