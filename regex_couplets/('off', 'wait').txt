('off', 'wait')

I step off the edge
There are spots waiting

in the form filled offered in trust
Though we are waiting for her

in the form filled offered trust
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

My daughter turns it off too
not needing to wait

iced coffee and sun position
waiting out front or up above 

I assume the offers reliable
