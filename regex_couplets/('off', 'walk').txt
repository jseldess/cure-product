('off', 'walk')

I step off the edge
Before we walk across the wide field

Face falling off the edge of the face
Before we walk across the wide opening

value falling off the edge of the face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

off the edge of the world
there was no walking along the pleasure

from which to step off
there was no walking along

off the end of the world
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

Sweets and coffee and juice
