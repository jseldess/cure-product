('off', 'ways')

I step off the edge
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

Face falling off the edge of the face
always watching

Sweets and coffee and juice
deep into pathways from repeated travels

in the form filled offered in trust
with constant ways 

who knows how to turn it off
with her ways to the ends

Bach helps turn it off
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

in track as offer asked
