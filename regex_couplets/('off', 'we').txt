('off', 'We')

I step off the edge
We’ll have coffee this morning

So I presume the offers already
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Face falling off the edge of the face
We can wrestle them with their goals

off the edge of the world
We had to say goodbye there

Sweets and coffee
We had to buy there

Sweets and coffee and juice
We had inhabited actually

in the form filled offered in trust
We got paid one way by a voice

in the form filled offered trust
We ask say in that case

I assume the offers reliable
