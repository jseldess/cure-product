('off', 'were')

I step off the edge
When we had jobs that were to earn

Coffe and
my desires were open

off the edge of the world
I wish my desires were open

I am first in the office 
I argued the days were longer

off the end of the world
I agrued the days were longer

off the end myself
The days were long

from which to step off
The days were long aligned

falling off the encoded end
they were on

Sweets and coffee and juice
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

in the form filled offered in trust
formerly a long time they were on

in the form filled offered trust
answered about 

in the form filled offered must
formerly along time they were on

in track as offer asked 
I answered what I thought

iced coffee and sun position
in the long time they were on

I assume the offers reliable
that they were visible

So I presume the offers already
that they were divisible

stepping off into the middle
I assumed that they were divisible

stopping off in all directions
