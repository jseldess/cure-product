('off', 'When')

I step off the edge
When I woke up in the morning

Face falling off the edge of the face
When I want something

off the edge of the world
When we had jobs that were to earn

Coffe and
When they really take hold of my finger

I am first in the office 
When closed to my knowing

Sweets and coffee and juice
When I'm watching my tv 

in the form filled offered in trust
