('off', 'will')

I step off the edge
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

off the edge of the world
will not be the same

falling off the end of the world
that will spur me on

Sweets and coffee and juice
would only willingly break

in the form filled offered in trust
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

in the form filled offered trust
my daughter will learn 

in track as offer asked
