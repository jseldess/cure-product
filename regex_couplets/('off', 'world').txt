('off', 'world')

I step off the edge
off the edge of the world

Face falling off the edge of the face
Which can be pronounced to the world

I am first in the office 
The world 

Coffe and
off the end of the world

off the end myself
hauling off the end of the world

eroded off the end
falling off the end of the world

falling off the end
the opinions in my world

in the form filled offered in trust
