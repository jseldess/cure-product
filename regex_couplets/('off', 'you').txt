('off', 'You')

I step off the edge
You should ask who I am

So I presume the offers already
You can hear it also through your leisure

off the edge of the world
You use the most essential parts

I am first in the office 
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Sweets and coffee and juice
You can have seen offering

in school and can see offering
