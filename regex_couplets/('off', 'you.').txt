('off', 'you.')

I step off the edge
Though how can you know without direction

off the edge of the world
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling off the edge of the face
if you have providence to excess

I am first in the office 
If you have confidence regardless all else

Coffe and
May I have your zip code

Where official policy is to catch and release
That you can see only the back of

off the end of the world
since you can imagine movement

off the end myself
where you can earn more 

falling off the end
you need history

Sweets and coffee and juice
I tell you my purposes

in the form filled offered in trust
This is your voice 

in the form filled offered trust
the young ripples inaudibly

I assume the offers reliable
