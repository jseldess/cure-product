('offer', 'up?')

So I presume the offers already
at home brought into privacy

in the form filled offered in trust
all parties would be held

in the form filled offered trust
answered about 

in the form filled offered must
 still carefully

in the form filled offered
In my heart did I lose trust

in track as offer asked 
bought in the surrounded privacy 

I assume the offers reliable
I assume the offers revisitable

I assume the offers divisible
I assumed 

I presume the offers
revisions that can be attributable

The offers there already
at home brought into private

So I resume the offers already
I offer to you

So I presume the offers
So I presume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home already
brought into privacy

I resume the offers at home
I resume at home

presume the offers at 
but I own all thatâ€™s messageable

Or can have seen offering possession
I presume to others

and can see offering
The sun high enough to strike directly

seen having or offering possession
You can have seen offering

in school and can see offering
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

can have seen offering possession
I assume possession to others
