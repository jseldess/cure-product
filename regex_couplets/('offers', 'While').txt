So I presume the offers already
Looking back while I should be sleeping

I assume the offers reliable
for a while to listen already

So I presume the offers at home already
for a while to listen 

I resume the offers at home
for a while not to listen

presume the offers at 
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

I presume the offers
