('offers', 'middle')

So I presume the offers already
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

I assume the offers reliable
stopping in the middle

I presume the offers
stepping in the middle

So I resume the offers already
stepping off into the middle

I assume the offers revisitable
stepping off in to the middle

I assume the offers divisible
