('offers', 'offer')

So I presume the offers already
in the form filled offered in trust

I assume the offers reliable
I assume the offers revisitable

I assume the offers divisible
in track as offer asked 

I presume the offers
The offers there already

So I resume the offers already
I offer to you

So I presume the offers
So I presume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home

presume the offers at 
Or can have seen offering possession
