('offers', 'resume')

So I presume the offers already
and canâ€™t presume to need

I assume the offers reliable
I presume the offers

The offers there already
So I resume the offers already

So I presume the offers
So I presume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home already
I resume the offers at home

presume the offers at 
I presume to others

I assume the offers revisitable
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
