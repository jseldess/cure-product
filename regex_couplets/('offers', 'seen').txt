('offers', 'seen')

So I presume the offers already
under the last seen principle

I assume the offers reliable
being seen by me

The offers there already
The prospects being seen by me

I presume the offers
Having seen more than I can remember 

I assume the offers revisitable
Or can have seen offering possession
