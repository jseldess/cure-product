('one', 'And')

I have entered my phone
And put in place as though stationary

Did he carry one virtue to excess
And as an extension of the values

Having transitioned from leisure to work
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
And we had to say goodbye to her there

As a clone, illegally conceived
And we could inhabit the room easy

nor envy honest work
