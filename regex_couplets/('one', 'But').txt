('one', 'but')

I have entered my phone
but not impart cynicism

Did he carry one virtue to excess
Attributable or

Having transitioned from leisure to work
but the sun isnâ€™t up

reflexing indented in my phone
I resume attributable visions

As a clone, illegally conceived
that decisions can be attributable

A way formerly like this one
but for memory elsewhere

shone formerly along time
decisions that can be attributable

that agreed to one the people
revisions that can be attributable

traffick is there nonetheless
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
