('one', 'For')

I have entered my phone
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Did he carry one virtue to excess
Forecasting the story before dawn

Having transitioned from leisure to work
For an ungraspable time

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
For Mitt Romney

nor envy honest work
For my own purchases

from no one point
Formerly a way like this one

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
Formerly away there are constant ways

Like this one other end of transactions
Forty-one seconds in

shone formerly a long time
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

traffick is there nonetheless
