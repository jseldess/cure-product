('one', 'if')

I have entered my phone
if not directly on my skin

Before anyone walks across the opening
drifting does not feel an exception

Did he carry one virtue to excess
if you have providence to excess

not one virtue to excess
if he had not carried one virtue 

nor envy honest work
out of the fifth page ruins

Having transitioned from leisure to work
That company creates a life

reflexing indented in my phone
If I take some different measure

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
If I take a different measure

As a clone, illegally conceived
if there is anything 

nor envy honestly
if you have providence

A way formerly like this one
if that has anything

that agreed one of rest
if only on the way to the trash

traffick is there nonetheless
