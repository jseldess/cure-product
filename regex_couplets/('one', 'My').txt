('one', 'My')

I have entered my phone
My associations

reflexing indented in my phone
My purpose up in the sky

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
My means without gravity

As a clone, illegally conceived
My daughter with her way

A way formerly like this one
My daughter helps too

Formerly a way like this one
My say to the elections

that agreed to one the people
