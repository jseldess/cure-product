('one', 'THE')

I have entered my phone
THE SNOW

Did he carry one virtue to excess
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

not one virtue to excess
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

Having transitioned from leisure to work
THE PLANNING PROCESS

So that I notice I am the only one
UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON

reflexing indented in my phone
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

As a clone, illegally conceived
THE OFFERS

that agreed to one the people
