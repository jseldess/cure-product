('one', 'That')

I have entered my phone
That’s exaclty what I want for them

Before anyone has walked across the field
That is itself not still

Did he carry one virtue to excess
That’s when they really take

Having transitioned from leisure to work
That you can see only the back of

reflexing indented in my phone
That I captured an afterimage

As a clone, illegally conceived
That are my right to say

that agreed to one the people
