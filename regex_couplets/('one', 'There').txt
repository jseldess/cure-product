('one', 'There')

I have entered my phone
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Before anyone walks across the opening
There are quarterly goals

Did he carry one virtue to excess
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

If he had not carried one virtue
There was very little physical activity

reflexing indented in my phone
There are spots waiting

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
There are constant ways

Formerly a way like this one
There are no constant waves

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
