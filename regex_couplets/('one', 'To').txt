('one', 'To')

I have entered my phone
To my children Walt Whitman

Did he carry one virtue to excess
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

If he had not carried one virtue
To neither study

nor envy honest work
To that impossible place

Having transitioned from leisure to work
Tomorrow 

reflexing indented in my phone
To substitute neither study

nor envy honestly
To the ends of transactions

that agreed one of rest
To the ends of my transactions

formerly a way like this one
To the other end of transactions

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
To the other end of transactions like this

Like this one other end of transactions
To the other end of means like this one

Like this one the other end of means
To the right of determined elections

that agreed to one the people
