('one', 'what')

I have entered my phone
in light of learning what we see

Before anyone buys up the opening
Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them

Before anyone has walked across the field
what I find there

Did he carry one virtue to excess
I invited most of what came next

reflexing indented in my phone
what literally moved

that agreed one of rest
I answered what I thought

shone formerly a long time
I assumed what I draw

in need one in that best own
I answered what I thought about

shone formerly along time
to return what I bought

that agreed to one the people
