('one', 'Which')

I have entered my phone
Which is a measure to never live out

Did he carry one virtue to excess
Which can be pronounced to the world

If he had not carried one virtue
Which is a pleasure to never live out

not one virtue to excess
Which can be called confidence

nor envy honest work
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

that agreed one of rest
