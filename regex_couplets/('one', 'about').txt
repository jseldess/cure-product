('one', 'about')

I have entered my phone
about my children’s consumption

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
burrowed about from repeated travels

that agreed one of rest
and literally moved about

– The Rolling Stones
answered about 

in need one in that best own
I answered about

from no one point
which I feel formerly about for

I had entered my phone
I answered what I thought about

shone formerly along time
about 

reflexing indented in my phone
