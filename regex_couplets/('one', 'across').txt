('one', 'across')

I have entered my phone
Before we walk across the wide opening

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Before anyone walks across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the field

Actually one day there is direction
across the retinas

reflexing indented in my phone
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

nor envy honest work
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
