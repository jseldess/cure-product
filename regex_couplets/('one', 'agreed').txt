('one', 'agreed')

I have entered my phone
and to which I’ve agreed

nor envy honest work
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

from no one point
and for which the plan agreed

that agreed one of rest
and to which the plan agreed

– The Rolling Stones
that agreed home

that agreed to one the people
that agreed one best

in need one in that best own
