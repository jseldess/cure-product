('one', 'along')

I have entered my phone
bring your child along

Did he carry one virtue to excess
The days lined along company

reflexing indented in my phone
formerly along time they were on

that agreed one of rest
formerly along my say to the elections

shone formerly a long time
drawn formerly along 

in need one in that best own
along cables

I had entered my phone
shone formerly along time

that agreed to one the people
