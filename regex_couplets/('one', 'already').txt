('one', 'already')

I have entered my phone
already formerly a long time

nor envy honest work
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

from no one point
with dawn already formerly nights 

that agreed one of rest
dawn already formerly nights 

– The Rolling Stones
So I presume the offers already

that agreed to one the people
The prospects there already

traffick is there nonetheless
