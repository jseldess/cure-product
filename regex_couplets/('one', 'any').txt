('one', 'any')

I have entered my phone
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Before anyone buys up the opening
Before anyone walks across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the field

Actually one day there is direction
at any time it can drift again

Did he carry one virtue to excess
Or the company

Having transitioned from leisure to work
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

reflexing indented in my phone
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
there wasn’t any television 

As a clone, illegally conceived
or alter of course the time anyway

nor envy honest work
They have very many choices

A way formerly like this one
latency which doesn’t mean anything

that agreed one of rest
if there is anything 

– The Rolling Stones
The many transparent pixel calls

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
or imagined anyway

that agreed to one the people
