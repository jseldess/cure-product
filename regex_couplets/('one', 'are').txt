('one', 'are')

I have entered my phone
Though there are quarters goals

Actually one day there is direction
there are quarters 

Did he carry one virtue to excess
barely outlines

Having transitioned from leisure to work
They are called aspirational

reflexing indented in my phone
There are spots waiting

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
Though we are waiting for her

nor envy honest work
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

A way formerly like this one
though we are breaking in the space that it had

from no one point
Though we are waiting 

that agreed one of rest
still carefully

in need one in that best own
There are constant ways

Formerly a way like this one
Formerly away there are constant ways

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
That are my right to say

that agreed to one the people
careening between the preambles

less only money
The prospect for careening healthily
