('one', 'around')

I have entered my phone
Spinning around the heart

Having transitioned from leisure to work
around my country 

reflexing indented in my phone
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
Articles all around us

As a clone, illegally conceived
More reasons around my country 

A way formerly like this one
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

from no one point
and around redundant

that agreed one of rest
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

Formerly a way like this one
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
