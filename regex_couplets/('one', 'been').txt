('one', 'been')

I have entered my phone
It has been since

Did he carry one virtue to excess
After having been contented

Having transitioned from leisure to work
that having been after content

reflexing indented in my phone
having been graspable

As a clone, illegally conceived
having been an ungraspable time

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
having been purchased out

nor envy honest work
