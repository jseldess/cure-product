('one', 'came')

I have entered my phone
I invited most of what came next

reflexing indented in my phone
I came back to me

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
I came after my past

As a clone, illegally conceived
until the bill came

nor envy honest work
and came home to rewind inflections

that agreed to one the people
and came home to rewind
