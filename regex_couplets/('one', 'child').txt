('one', 'child')

I have entered my phone
about my childrenâ€™s consumption

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
on a snow day with my children

Before anyone buys up the opening
especially in a child

Actually one day there is direction
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Did he carry one virtue to excess
even my child

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
my possession of my children

that agreed one of rest
speech my possession of my children

in need one in that best own
