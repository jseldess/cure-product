('one', 'could')

I have entered my phone
and could be mapped and weighed

Having transitioned from leisure to work
until I could not tire 

reflexing indented in my phone
I could consume the dream

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
I could in effect credit

As a clone, illegally conceived
and we could inhabit the room easy

nor envy honest work
and could be inflected with reasons

that agreed to one the people
