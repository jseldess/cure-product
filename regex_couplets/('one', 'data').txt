('one', 'data')

I have entered my phone
I’ll pull my data higher up

Did he carry one virtue to excess
I’ll pull my data

Having transitioned from leisure to work
The days of private data

reflexing indented in my phone
trackers collecting data on users

A way formerly like this one
my interfaced stand data

I had entered my phone
my standing in data

shone formerly along time
