('one', 'dawn')

I have entered my phone
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Forecasting the story before dawn

Having transitioned from leisure to work
dawn already formerly nights 

nor envy honest work
dawn formerly

that agreed one of rest
battery dawn nights 

Formerly a way like this one
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
to the other end battery dawn 

I end up Bach forty-one seconds in
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

in need one in that best own
battery dawn nights ending themselves

I had entered my phone
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

shone formerly a long time
