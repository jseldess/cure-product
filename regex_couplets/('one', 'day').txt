('one', 'day')

I have entered my phone
on a snow day with my children

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
One day there is direction

Before anyone walks across the opening
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

Actually one day there is direction
I argued the days felt longer

reflexing indented in my phone
The day

nor envy honest work
at least most days

I had entered my phone
