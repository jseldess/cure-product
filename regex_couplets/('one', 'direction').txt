('one', 'direction')

I have entered my phone
Of course there is a direction

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
One day there is direction

Before anyone walks across the opening
on a day there will be direction

Actually one day there is direction
how can I know without direction

Did he carry one virtue to excess
stopping off in all directions
