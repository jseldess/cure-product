('one', 'directly')

I have entered my phone
if not directly on my skin

Before anyone walks across the opening
of not directly from my skin

Actually one day there is direction
But not to me directly

Having transitioned from leisure to work
The sun high enough to enter directly 

reflexing indented in my phone
The sun high enough to strike directly
