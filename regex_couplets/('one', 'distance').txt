('one', 'distance')

I have entered my phone
Falling from this distance

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
A person from a distance

Having transitioned from leisure to work
And from a weak distance

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
And from that great distance

As a clone, illegally conceived
