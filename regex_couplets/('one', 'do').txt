('one', 'do')

I have entered my phone
In a sharp downard turn

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
does not feel an exception

Did he carry one virtue to excess
The dogs and lillies

If he had not carried one virtue
I brought my head down

Having transitioned from leisure to work
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

reflexing indented in my phone
here is the site of the battle of maldon

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

As a clone, illegally conceived
and it doesn’t take long

that agreed one of rest
latency which doesn’t mean anything

in need one in that best own
I only think I don’t listen

traffick is there nonetheless
