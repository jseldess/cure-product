('one', 'down')

I have entered my phone
In a sharp downard turn

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
in a sharp downward turn 

Did he carry one virtue to excess
I brought my head down

Having transitioned from leisure to work
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
