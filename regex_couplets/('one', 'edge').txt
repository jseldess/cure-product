('one', 'edge')

I have entered my phone
Face falling off the edge of the face

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
The edge is put in place

Did he carry one virtue to excess
off the edge of the world

If he had not carried one virtue
Falling off the edge of the face

Having transitioned from leisure to work
and testing the edge and gravity

reflexing indented in my phone
