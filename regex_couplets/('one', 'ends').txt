('one', 'ends')

I have entered my phone
to the ends of my transactions

nor envy honest work
The ends of my transactions

from no one point
To the ends of transactions

that agreed one of rest
to the ends of actions

A way formerly like this one
to the ends

Formerly a way like this one
with her ways to the ends

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
