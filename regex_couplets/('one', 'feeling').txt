('one', 'feeling')

I have entered my phone
conversations with our feelings

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
conversation with our feelings

Before anyone buys up the opening
But my not feeling the memory aside

A way formerly like this one
But my not feeling the memory inside

from no one point
By my feeling the memory inside

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
But my feeling the memory aside

I had entered my phone
