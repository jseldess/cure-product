('one', 'front')

I have entered my phone
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Before anyone walks across the opening
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

Having transitioned from leisure to work
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

reflexing indented in my phone
And need out in front purchase

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
behind or out front or up above

that agreed to one the people
