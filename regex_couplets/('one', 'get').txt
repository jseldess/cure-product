('one', 'get')

I have entered my phone
I’ll get there eventually

Did he carry one virtue to excess
I’ll get there ruins

Having transitioned from leisure to work
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

reflexing indented in my phone
I get through there

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
in traversing get through there

As a clone, illegally conceived
forgetting decisions 

that agreed one of rest
forgettable
