('one', 'going')

I have entered my phone
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

reflexing indented in my phone
The way that she is going

A way formerly like this one
The way that I am going

Formerly a way like this one
The way that I was going

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
way I was going 

I end up Bach forty-one seconds in
A way I was going

shone formerly a long time
