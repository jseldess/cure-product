('one', 'have')

I have entered my phone
before we can have a retroactive

Before anyone buys up the opening
as long as I have access to the code

Actually one day there is direction
if you have providence to excess

not one virtue to excess
If you have confidence regardless all else

if he had not carried one virtue 
May I have your zip code

Having transitioned from leisure to work
I have them lost

reflexing indented in my phone
I have supporters

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
I have a memory between the day

nor envy honest work
I have entered my purposes

A way formerly like this one
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

that agreed one of rest
I have turned it off

Formerly a way like this one
and have no way

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
I have them trust in me

that agreed to one the people
I have seen more than I can remember
