('one', 'here')

I have entered my phone
Of course there is a direction

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Before anyone walks across the opening
One day there is direction

Actually one day there is direction
Though there are quarters goals 

Did he carry one virtue to excess
I’ll get there eventually

If he had not carried one virtue
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

not one virtue to excess
Where official policy is to catch and release

Having transitioned from leisure to work
there was no promotion

reflexing indented in my phone
I get through there

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
in traversing get through there

As a clone, illegally conceived
here is the site of the battle of maldon

nor envy honest work
and elsewhere my memory of you

A way formerly like this one
where I send and relive would be held

from no one point
where I am aside at least

that agreed one of rest
Where in me did I host

– The Rolling Stones
there wasn’t any television 

in need one in that best own
Is there a baby and a bear

Formerly a way like this one
There are constant ways

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
Formerly away there are constant ways

Like this one other end of transactions
where rights ended themselves

need one in best own
By my memory elsewhere

I had entered my phone
in memory elsewhere

shone from the housing
but for memory elsewhere

shone formerly along time
where lights blended themselves

that agreed to one the people
The prospects there already

traffick is there nonetheless
