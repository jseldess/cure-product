('one', 'hold')

I have entered my phone
I take hold of my finger

not one virtue to excess
When they really take hold of my finger

Having transitioned from leisure to work
Since I had to hold the entire company

reflexing indented in my phone
and hold and wish to hold

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
designed to hold up my underwear

As a clone, illegally conceived
