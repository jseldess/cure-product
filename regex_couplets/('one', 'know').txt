('one', 'know')

I have entered my phone
who knows the way

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
how can I know without direction

Did he carry one virtue to excess
I even know what I would find

reflexing indented in my phone
even when close to my knowing

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
When closed to my knowing

As a clone, illegally conceived
knowing the constituents

that agreed one of rest
who knows how to turn it off

Formerly a way like this one
who know the ways to their other end

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
that their knowing

that agreed to one the people
