('one', 'literally')

I have entered my phone
and literally moved

nor envy honest work
as it was designed literally

from no one point
and literally unproved

that agreed one of rest
and literally moved about

â€“ The Rolling Stones
literally moved

in need one in that best own
not literally moved about

I had entered my phone
not literally moved

reflexing indented in my phone
