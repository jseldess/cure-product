('one', 'live')

I have entered my phone
Which is a measure to never live out

Did he carry one virtue to excess
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

If he had not carried one virtue
Which is a pleasure to never live out

not one virtue to excess
where I send and relive aside

A way formerly like this one
where I send and relive would be held

from no one point
where I send and retrieve relive

that agreed one of rest
where I send and relive

I had entered my phone
