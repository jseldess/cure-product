('one', 'move')

I have entered my phone
since I can imagine movement

reflexing indented in my phone
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

As a clone, illegally conceived
and literally moved

nor envy honest work
myself moved literally as it is

that agreed one of rest
and literally moved about

– The Rolling Stones
literally moved

in need one in that best own
not literally moved about

from no one point
also didn’t really move

I had entered my phone
not literally moved

that agreed to one the people
