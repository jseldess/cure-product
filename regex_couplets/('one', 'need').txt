('one', 'need')

I have entered my phone
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Before anyone walks across the opening
and can’t presume to need

Did he carry one virtue to excess
I need the work

reflexing indented in my phone
And need out in front purchase

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
where I need gravity

As a clone, illegally conceived
not needing to wait

that agreed one of rest
in need one in that best own

need one in best own
that in need one best own

decisioned to learn 
without really needing

– The Rolling Stones
