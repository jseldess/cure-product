('one', 'night')

I have entered my phone
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

Did he carry one virtue to excess
blue and sun again a second, then night

reflexing indented in my phone
dawn already formerly nights 

nor envy honest work
last night

that agreed one of rest
battery dawn nights 

Formerly a way like this one
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
nights

I end up Bach forty-one seconds in
battery dawn nights ending themselves

I had entered my phone
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

shone formerly a long time
