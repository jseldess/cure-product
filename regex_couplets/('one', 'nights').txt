('one', 'nights')

I have entered my phone
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
dawn already formerly nights 

nor envy honest work
with dawn already formerly nights 

that agreed one of rest
battery dawn nights 

Formerly a way like this one
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
nights

I end up Bach forty-one seconds in
battery dawn nights ending themselves

I had entered my phone
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

shone formerly a long time
