('one', 'nor')

I have entered my phone
into the minority proportion of time

Actually one day there is direction
over the long line I would honor

Did he carry one virtue to excess
nor work in this way daily

nor envy honest work
nor envy honestly

Having transitioned from leisure to work
the simple act of honoring an accountant

reflexing indented in my phone
which had on honor to be told

that agreed one of rest
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

shone formerly a long time
