('one', 'only')

I have entered my phone
only fragments of time with my children

Actually one day there is direction
only in the case

if he had not carried one virtue 
So that I notice I am the only one

So that I donâ€™t notice I am the only one
I see only the back of falling values

reflexing indented in my phone
would only willingly break

that agreed one of rest
if only on the way to the trash

traffick is there nonetheless
less only money
