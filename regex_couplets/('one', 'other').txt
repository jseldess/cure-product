('one', 'other')

I have entered my phone
others desires

Did he carry one virtue to excess
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Having transitioned from leisure to work
On the other hand

reflexing indented in my phone
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
and other types of tracking technology

nor envy honest work
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

A way formerly like this one
I presume to others

that agreed one of rest
to the other end

Formerly a way like this one
the other end transactions

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
the other end of actions

Like this one other end of transactions
To the other end of means like this one

Like this one the other end of means
to the other end of actions

I end up Bach forty-one seconds in
with constant ways to the other end

Forty-one seconds in
to the other end of transactions

shone formerly a long time
Cereal and others’ health

that agreed to one the people
I assume possession to others
