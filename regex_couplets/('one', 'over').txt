('one', 'over')

I have entered my phone
I step over the edge

Did he carry one virtue to excess
hovering above standing water

Having transitioned from leisure to work
oddly grown over with historic bark

reflexing indented in my phone
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

nor envy honest work
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

A way formerly like this one
for not paying sound overwhelmed

that agreed one of rest
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
