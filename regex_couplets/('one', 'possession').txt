('one', 'possession')

I have entered my phone
I speak to them my possessions

that agreed one of rest
speak them of my possessions

â€“ The Rolling Stones
my possession of my children

in need one in that best own
phrase them of my possessions

decisioned by the prospect
I speak them of my possessions

A way formerly like this one
speech my possession of my children

need one in best own
I stay the right of my possessions 

reflexing indented in my phone
possessions people

that agreed to one the people
phrase them of our possessions

that in need one best own
Or can have seen offering possession
