('one', 'presume')

I have entered my phone
and canâ€™t presume to need

Did he carry one virtue to excess
I continue to presume

As a clone, illegally conceived
I presume to others

that agreed one of rest
So I presume the offers already

that agreed to one the people
I presume the offers

traffick is there nonetheless
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
