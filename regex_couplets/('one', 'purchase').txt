('one', 'purchase')

I have entered my phone
conversations with our purchase

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
in traversing my purchase

reflexing indented in my phone
purchased out

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
having been purchased out

As a clone, illegally conceived
I have entered my purchases

A way formerly like this one
for my own purchases

from no one point
converting sight into a purchase

Formerly a way like this one
impulse for my own purchases

I had entered my phone
at the site of a purchase

that agreed to one the people
