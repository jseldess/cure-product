('one', 'purpose')

I have entered my phone
by no ventillation my purpose

Did he carry one virtue to excess
until my purpose up in the sky

Having transitioned from leisure to work
until I purpose the horizon

reflexing indented in my phone
in conversing of my purpose

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
in traversing my purpose

As a clone, illegally conceived
My purpose up in the sky

nor envy honest work
I have entered my purposes

A way formerly like this one
the impulse for my own purposes

from no one point
to the other end of my purpose

shone formerly a long time
the impulse to my purpose

I had entered my phone
for my own purposes

that agreed to one the people
