('one', 'purposes')

I have entered my phone
I tell you my purposes

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
I tell you the weight of my purposes

As a clone, illegally conceived
Where I host my purposes

nor envy honest work
I have entered my purposes

A way formerly like this one
the impulse for my own purposes

from no one point
for my own purposes

reflexing indented in my phone
