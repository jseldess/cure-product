('one', 'really')

I have entered my phone
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Before anyone walks across the opening
When they really take hold of my finger

Having transitioned from leisure to work
without really agreeing

nor envy honest work
without really speaking

from no one point
without really branding 

that agreed one of rest
without really needing

– The Rolling Stones
also didn’t really move

I had entered my phone
