('one', 'retrieve')

I have entered my phone
I send and retrieve the impulse

A way formerly like this one
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

from no one point
where I send and retrieve relive

that agreed one of rest
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

Formerly a way like this one
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

shone formerly a long time
I stand and retrieve the impulse

I had entered my phone
