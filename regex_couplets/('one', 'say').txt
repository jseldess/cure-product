('one', 'say')

I have entered my phone
we had to say goodbye

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
I ask say in that case

decisioned to learn back
we ask say in that case

phase decisioned by the prospect
I ask say in that phase decisioned

A way formerly like this one
formerly along my say to the elections

shone formerly a long time
My say to the elections

reflexing indented in my phone
