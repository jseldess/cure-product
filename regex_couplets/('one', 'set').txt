('one', 'set')

I have entered my phone
upset by Gingrich

If he had not carried one virtue
in front of the set afternoon

reflexing indented in my phone
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
Um, upset by Gingrich

nor envy honest work
presets

that agreed to one the people
