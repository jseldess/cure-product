('one', 'stay')

I have entered my phone
wrestling to stay still

Did he carry one virtue to excess
So stay with us

reflexing indented in my phone
own stays brought loyal

in need one in that best own
own that stays brought loyal

need one in best own
that stays brought loyal

decisioned to learn 
I stay the right of my elections

that agreed to one the people
home stays brought loyal

that agreed one best
own stays bought loyal

that agreed one of rest
