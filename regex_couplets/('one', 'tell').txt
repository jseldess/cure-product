('one', 'tell')

I have entered my phone
Then I constellate my time family country

Did he carry one virtue to excess
So I constellate the time family country

If he had not carried one virtue
I constellate the time

not one virtue to excess
The CEO tells me to embody values

Having transitioned from leisure to work
I had to tell them the news

reflexing indented in my phone
I tell you my purposes

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
I tell you the weight of my purchases

As a clone, illegally conceived
and that man comes on to tell me 

â€“ The Rolling Stones
