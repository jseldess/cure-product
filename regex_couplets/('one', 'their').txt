('one', 'their')

I have entered my phone
We can wrestle them with their goals

Did he carry one virtue to excess
I am not allowed to see their face

reflexing indented in my phone
without their agreement

that agreed one of rest
to their other end

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
that their knowing

that agreed to one the people
