('one', 'themselves')

I have entered my phone
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
talking into pheasants bending themselves

reflexing indented in my phone
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

that agreed one of rest
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

in need one in that best own
battery dawn nights ending themselves

I had entered my phone
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

shone formerly a long time
where rights ended themselves

that agreed to one the people
