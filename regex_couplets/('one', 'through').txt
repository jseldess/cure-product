('one', 'through')

I have entered my phone
You can hear it also through your leisure

Did he carry one virtue to excess
Back up through the results

Having transitioned from leisure to work
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

reflexing indented in my phone
I get through there

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
in traversing get through there

As a clone, illegally conceived
