('one', 'told')

I have entered my phone
I am told ventillation

Did he carry one virtue to excess
I am told by no ventillation

Having transitioned from leisure to work
I am told by the ventillation

So that I notice I am the only one
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
which ran to be told

that agreed one of rest
