('one', 'turn')

I have entered my phone
In a sharp downard turn

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
in a sharp downward turn 

Did he carry one virtue to excess
I keep turning back again myself

Having transitioned from leisure to work
who knows how to turn it off

Formerly a way like this one
I turn not sad exactly

I had entered my phone
I return not sad exactly

reflexing indented in my phone
I returned

that agreed to one the people
