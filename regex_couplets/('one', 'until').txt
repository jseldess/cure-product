('one', 'until')

I have entered my phone
until my purpose up in the sky

Did he carry one virtue to excess
until I could not tire 

reflexing indented in my phone
until I purpose up in the sky

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
until I purchase up the sky

As a clone, illegally conceived
until a happier time found

that agreed one of rest
