('one', 'us')

I have entered my phone
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Before anyone walks across the opening
They’re just not mine

Actually one day there is direction
russling to stay still

Did he carry one virtue to excess
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

If he had not carried one virtue
I want to cite a poem so usual

not one virtue to excess
was not just a defeat

nor envy honestly
In a vertiginous dream

Having transitioned from leisure to work
The ventillation rushes on

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
I just got a letter

reflexing indented in my phone
a futile joyous white sun

As a clone, illegally conceived
Articles all around us

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
I used my technology

nor envy honest work
trackers collecting data on users

A way formerly like this one
in the form filled offered in trust

from no one point
useless for not having paid

that agreed one of rest
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

in need one in that best own
radiating from housing

shone from the housing
I have them trust in me

that agreed to one the people
