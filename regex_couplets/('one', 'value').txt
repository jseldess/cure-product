('one', 'value')

I have entered my phone
value falling off the edge of the face

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Then I cannot see face value

Did he carry one virtue to excess
The CEO tells me to embody values

Having transitioned from leisure to work
I see only the back of falling values

reflexing indented in my phone
