('one', 'ventillation')

I have entered my phone
I am told ventillation

Did he carry one virtue to excess
by no ventillation my purpose

Having transitioned from leisure to work
I am told by the ventillation

So that I notice I am the only one
The ventillation rushes on

So that I donâ€™t notice I am the only one
