('one', 'waiting')

I have entered my phone
There are spots waiting

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
Though we are waiting for her

nor envy honest work
Though we are waiting 

that agreed one of rest
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

Formerly a way like this one
waiting out front or up above 

reflexing indented in my phone
