('one', 'want')

I have entered my phone
When I want something

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
I want to find a way to block it incoming

Before anyone buys up the opening
I want to find a way to block it

Before anyone walks across the opening
Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them

Before anyone has walked across the field
I want but not to impart cynicism

Did he carry one virtue to excess
I want to cite a poem so usual

not one virtue to excess
I want to cite a poem

if he had not carried one virtue 
all that I can think I want
