('one', 'We')

I have entered my phone
We can wrestle them with their goals

Did he carry one virtue to excess
We had to say goodbye there

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
We had inhabited actually

nor envy honest work
We got paid one way by a voice

nor envy honestly
We ask say in that case

that agreed to one the people
