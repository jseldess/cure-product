('one', 'were')

I have entered my phone
When we had jobs that were to earn

not one virtue to excess
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

Did he carry one virtue to excess
my desires were open

Having transitioned from leisure to work
I argued the days were longer

reflexing indented in my phone
in the long time they were on

redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

As a clone, illegally conceived
formerly a long time they were on

nor envy honest work
answered about 

that agreed one of rest
by the sight of the hosting answered about

in need one in that best own
I answered what I thought

shone formerly a long time
formerly along time they were on

need one in best own
I answered about

from no one point
I answered while interfaced

shone formerly along time
time they were on

that agreed to one the people
that they were divisible
