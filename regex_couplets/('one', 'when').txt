('one', 'When')

I have entered my phone
When I want something

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
When we had jobs that were to earn

not one virtue to excess
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

Did he carry one virtue to excess
When they really take hold of my finger

Having transitioned from leisure to work
When closed to my knowing

As a clone, illegally conceived
When I'm watching my tv 

â€“ The Rolling Stones
