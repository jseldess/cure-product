('one', 'world')

I have entered my phone
off the edge of the world

Did he carry one virtue to excess
Which can be pronounced to the world

If he had not carried one virtue
The world 

not one virtue to excess
off the end of the world

reflexing indented in my phone
the opinions in my world

that agreed one of rest
