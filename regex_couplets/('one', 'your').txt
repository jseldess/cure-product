('one', 'your')

I have entered my phone
You can hear it also through your leisure

Did he carry one virtue to excess
May I have your zip code

Having transitioned from leisure to work
your bid to the next highest ranked network

reflexing indented in my phone
This is your voice 

nor envy honest work
This is your choice 

nor envy honestly
This is your chance

A way formerly like this one
