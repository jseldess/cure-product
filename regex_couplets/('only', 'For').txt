('only', 'For')

only fragments of time with my children
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

only in the case
Forecasting the story before dawn

So that I notice I am the only one
For an ungraspable time

would only willingly break
Formerly a way like this one

if only on the way to the trash
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

less only money
