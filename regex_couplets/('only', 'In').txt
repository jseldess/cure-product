('only', 'IN')

only fragments of time with my children
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

only in the case
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

So that I notice I am the only one
UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON

I see only the back of falling values
ASPIRATING

I see only the back
ASPIRATING VISIONS

The planning process is for visionaries only
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

would only willingly break
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

if only on the way to the trash
