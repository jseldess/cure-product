('only', 'so')

only fragments of time with my children
You can hear it also through your leisure

only in the case
A person from a distance

So that I notice I am the only one
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

I see only the back of falling values
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

would only willingly break
for not paying sound overwhelmed

if only on the way to the trash
and could be inflected with reasons
