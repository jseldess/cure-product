('only', 'That')

only fragments of time with my children
That is itself not still

only in the case
That’s when they really take

So that I notice I am the only one
That you can see only the back of

then I can see only the back values
That can’t be glimpsed

The planning process is for visionaries only
That company creates a life

would only willingly break
That are my right to say

if only on the way to the trash
