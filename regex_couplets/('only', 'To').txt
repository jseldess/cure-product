('only', 'To')

only fragments of time with my children
To my children Walt Whitman

only in the case
To neither study

So that I notice I am the only one
Tomorrow 

I see only the back of falling values
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

would only willingly break
To the ends of transactions

if only on the way to the trash
