('only', 'act')

only fragments of time with my children
One day was actually

only in the case
I was enjoined to act again

So that I notice I am the only one
and strategies not tactics

I see only the back
Not goals or tactics

The planning process is for visionaries only
I was enjoined to act again myself

would only willingly break
the ends of my transactions

if only on the way to the trash
before I act on them
