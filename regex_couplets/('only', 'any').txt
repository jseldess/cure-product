('only', 'any')

only fragments of time with my children
at any time it can drift again

only in the case
Or the company

So that I notice I am the only one
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

would only willingly break
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

if only on the way to the trash
