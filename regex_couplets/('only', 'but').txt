('only', 'but')

only fragments of time with my children
but not impart cynicism

only in the case
Attributable or

So that I notice I am the only one
but the sun isn’t up

I see only the back of falling values
but it continued

would only willingly break
that decisions can be attributable

if only on the way to the trash
revisions that can be attributable

I only think I don’t listen
but I own all that’s messageable

less only money
decisions that can be attributable
