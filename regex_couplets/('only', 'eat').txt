('only', 'eat')

only fragments of time with my children
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

only in the case
was not just a defeat

So that I notice I am the only one
of the habits I create

I can see only the back of falling values
of the habits they create

I can see only the back of their economic value
they create

The planning process is for visionaries only
of the habits they create.

would only willingly break
for the creation of the universe

if only on the way to the trash
