('only', 'economic')

only fragments of time with my children
of my economic value

I can see only values falling back
of the economic value my habits

I can see only the back of falling values
of the economic value

then I can see only the back values
I can see only the back of their economic value

That you can see only the back of
increasingly that their economic value

The planning process is for visionaries only
that their economic value 

only in the case
between cereal and economic

if only on the way to the trash
