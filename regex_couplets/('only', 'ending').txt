('only', 'ending')

only fragments of time with my children
I tried to feel the key values extending 

The planning process is for visionaries only
talking into pheasants bending themselves

only in the case
talking into percents bending themselves

would only willingly break
battery dawn nights blending themselves

if only on the way to the trash
