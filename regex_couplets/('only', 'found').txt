('only', 'found')

only fragments of time with my children
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

would only willingly break
and found redundant

would speak willingly only
and latency found

if only on the way to the trash
So I found myself at home

I only think I donâ€™t listen
