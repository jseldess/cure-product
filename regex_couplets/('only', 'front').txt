('only', 'front')

only fragments of time with my children
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

So that I notice I am the only one
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

I see only the back of falling values
in front of the set afternoon

The planning process is for visionaries only
in front of the set of regulations

only in the case
And need out in front purchase

would only willingly break
behind or out front or up above

if only on the way to the trash
