('only', 'goal')

only fragments of time with my children
Though there are quarters goals

only in the case
before morning goals

So that I notice I am the only one
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

I see only the back of falling values
not goals

I see only the back
Not goals or tactics

The planning process is for visionaries only
What would I feel without that goal

would only willingly break
