('only', 'habits')

only fragments of time with my children
I see only the back of my habits

I can see only the back of falling values
of the economic value my habits

I can see only values falling back
of the habits they create

I can see only the back of their economic value
The strength of the habits

The planning process is for visionaries only
of the habits they create.

only in the case
