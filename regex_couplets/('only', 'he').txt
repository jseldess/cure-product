('only', 'he')

only fragments of time with my children
Then fall then summer

only in the case
if he had not carried one virtue 

So that I notice I am the only one
The ventillation rushes on

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
I am the first in the office

I see only the back of falling values
blue and sun again a second, then night

I see only the back
upsent in the afternoon

I can see only values falling back
then I cannot see face value

I see only the back of my habits
of the habits I create

I can see only the back of falling values
What the next step

then I can see only the back of values
out in the snow fall

The planning process is for visionaries only
of the economic value my habits

then I can see only the back values
of the habits they create

I can see only the back of their economic value
Their economic value

That you can see only the back of
out in the snow

would only willingly break
only with the latency 

would speak willingly only
with the latency last night

would only willingly speak
knowing the constituents

if only on the way to the trash
the prospects there already

I only think I don’t listen
traffick is there nonetheless

less only money
The prospect for careening healthily
