('only', 'her')

only fragments of time with my children
on a day there will be direction

only in the case
To neither study

So that I notice I am the only one
there was no promotion

would only willingly break
Where in me did I host

if only on the way to the trash
the prospects there already

I only think I donâ€™t listen
traffick is there nonetheless

less only money
I presume to others
