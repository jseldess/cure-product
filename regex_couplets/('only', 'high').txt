('only', 'high')

only fragments of time with my children
way high up in the inter

only in the case
higher up in the results

So that I notice I am the only one
your bid to the next highest ranked network

The planning process is for visionaries only
The sun high enough to enter directly 

would only willingly break
The sun high enough to strike directly
