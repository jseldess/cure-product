('only', 'now')

only fragments of time with my children
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

only in the case
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

So that I notice I am the only one
out in the snow

I see only the back of falling values
out in the snow fall

then I can see only the back of values
out in the snow falling face value

then I can see only the back values
I take it out in the snow fall

would only willingly break
knowing the constituents

if only on the way to the trash
