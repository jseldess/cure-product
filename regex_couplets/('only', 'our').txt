('only', 'our')

only fragments of time with my children
You can hear it also through your leisure

only in the case
Two hours and

So that I notice I am the only one
with four key value pairs

The planning process is for visionaries only
your bid to the next highest ranked network

would only willingly break
Who throws contours away

if only on the way to the trash
