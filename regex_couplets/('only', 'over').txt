('only', 'over')

only fragments of time with my children
I step over the edge

only in the case
hovering above standing water

So that I notice I am the only one
oddly grown over with historic bark

The planning process is for visionaries only
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

would only willingly break
for not paying sound overwhelmed

if only on the way to the trash
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
