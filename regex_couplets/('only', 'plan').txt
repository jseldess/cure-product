('only', 'plan')

only fragments of time with my children
and is relentlessly planned

only in the case
The planning process for visions

I see only the back
I see the back of the planning process

I can see only values falling back
The planning process is for visionaries only

I see only the back of my habits
the planning process for decisions

I can see only the back of falling values
and for which the plan agreed

if only on the way to the trash
