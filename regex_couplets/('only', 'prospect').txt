('only', 'prospect')

only fragments of time with my children
the impulse for my own prospects

would only willingly break
stopping into the prospect

if only on the way to the trash
the prospects there already

I only think I donâ€™t listen
The prospect for careening attached

less only money
The prospect for careening healthily
