('only', 'step')

only fragments of time with my children
I step off the edge

only in the case
What the next step

I see only the back
What’s the next step

The planning process is for visionaries only
The next step 

would only willingly break
step in by the prospect

if only on the way to the trash
stepping in the middle

I only think I don’t listen
stepping off into the middle
