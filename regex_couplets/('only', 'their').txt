('only', 'their')

only fragments of time with my children
We can wrestle them with their goals

only in the case
I am not allowed to see their face

then I can see only the back values
I can see only the back of their economic value

That you can see only the back of
increasingly that their economic value

The planning process is for visionaries only
that their economic value 

would only willingly break
without their agreement

if only on the way to the trash
