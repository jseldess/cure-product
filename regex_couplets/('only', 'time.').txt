('only', 'time.')

only fragments of time with my children
where I sleep at times

only in the case
 and time in the train

So that I notice I am the only one
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

I see only the back of falling values
The long time I had a vision

would only willingly break
until a happier time found

if only on the way to the trash
