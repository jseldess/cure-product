('only', 'up?')

only fragments of time with my children
Then fall then summer

only in the case
upset by Gingrich

So that I notice I am the only one
The ventillation rushes on

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
Then the sun isn’t up

I see only the back of falling values
blue and sun again a second, then night

I see only the back
of my economic value

I can see only values falling back
an upsent afternoon

I see only the back of my habits
upsent in the afternoon

I can see only the back of falling values
then I cannot see face value

then I can see only the back of values
out in the snow fall

The planning process is for visionaries only
of the economic value my habits

then I can see only the back values
I can see only the back of their economic value

That you can see only the back of
out in the snow

would only willingly break
from my constituents

only from constituents
would only speak willingly

only with the latency 
all parties would be held

would speak willingly only
would only willingly speak

if only on the way to the trash
So I found myself at home

I only think I don’t listen
but I own all that’s messageable

less only money
I presume the offers
