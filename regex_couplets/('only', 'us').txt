('only', 'us')

only fragments of time with my children
They’re just not mine

only in the case
was not just a defeat

So that I notice I am the only one
The ventillation rushes on

So that I don’t notice I am the only one
I just got a letter

I see only the back of falling values
So stay with us

would only willingly break
useless for not having paid

if only on the way to the trash
