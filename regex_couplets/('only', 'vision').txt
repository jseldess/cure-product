('only', 'vision')

only fragments of time with my children
I had me a vision

So that I notice I am the only one
The planning process for visions

I see only the back
The planning process is for visionaries only

I see only the back of my habits
aspirating visions

only in the case
The long time I had a vision

would only willingly break
there wasn’t any television 

if only on the way to the trash
revisions that can be attributable

I only think I don’t listen
