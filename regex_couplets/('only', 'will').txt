('only', 'will')

only fragments of time with my children
on a day there will be direction

only in the case
will not be the same

would only willingly break
would only speak willingly

only with the latency 
would speak willingly only

would only willingly speak
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

if only on the way to the trash
