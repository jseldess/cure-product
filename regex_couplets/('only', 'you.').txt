('only', 'you.')

only fragments of time with my children
Though how can you know without direction

only in the case
May I have your zip code

So that I notice I am the only one
That you can see only the back of

then I can see only the back values
your bid to the next highest ranked network

The planning process is for visionaries only
since you can imagine movement

would only willingly break
the young ripples inaudibly

if only on the way to the trash
