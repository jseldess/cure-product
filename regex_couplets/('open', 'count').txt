('open', 'count')

Before we walk across the wide opening
Then I constellate my time family country

my desires were open
I brought my count down

I wish my desires were open
without the long time I was accounting

The simple act opening surmounted
the simple act of honoring an accountant

the simple act of opening surmounted
in the simple act of opening an accountant
