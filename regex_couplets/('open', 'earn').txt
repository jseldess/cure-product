('open', 'earn')

Before we walk across the wide opening
in light of learning what we see

Before anyone buys up the opening
When we had jobs that were to earn

my desires were open
I spend time online learning to code

I wish my desires were open
learned without too much difficulty to code

The simple act opening surmounted
decisioned to learn
