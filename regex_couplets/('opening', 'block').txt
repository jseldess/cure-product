('opening', 'block')

Before we walk across the wide opening
I want to find a way to block it incoming

Before anyone buys up the opening
I want to find a way to block it

Before anyone walks across the opening
I can find a way to block it incoming

Before anyone has walked across the opening
I can find a way to block incoming 

The simple act opening surmounted
