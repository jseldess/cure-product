('opening', 'eat')

Before we walk across the wide opening
I reach repeated expressions first

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
I propogated repeated expressions first

Before anyone buys up the opening
skin smile repeated expressions

Before anyone walks across the opening
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

The simple act opening surmounted
it was not just a defeat
