('opening', 'he')

Before we walk across the wide opening
who knows the way

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
In the light of retroactive

Before anyone buys up the opening
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Before anyone walks across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the opening

The simple act opening surmounted
The simple act of opening surmounted

in the simple act of opening a book
in the simple act of opening an accountant
