('opening', 'open')

Before we walk across the wide opening
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Before anyone buys up the opening
Before anyone walks across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the opening
my desires were open

The simple act opening surmounted
The simple act of opening surmounted

in the simple act of opening a book
in the simple act of opening an accountant
