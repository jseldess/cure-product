('opening', 'up?')

Before we walk across the wide opening
In a sharp downard turn

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
conversations with our reactions

Before anyone buys up the opening
such as I see

Before anyone walks across the opening
The sun isnâ€™t up 

The simple act opening surmounted
You can clear it also through static seizure

The simple act of opening surmounted
the simple act of honoring an accountant

in the simple act of opening a book
in the simple act of opening an accountant
