into the minority proportion of time
And put in place as though stationary

or not even rotating
And as an extension of the values

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
And make myself a visible

to be before the sun
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

missing words
And we had to say goodbye to her there

for an ungraspable purchase
And need out in front purchase

For an ungraspable time
And read out in front

And for an ungraspable time
And reached up the screen

I have supporters
And from a weak distance

having supporters 
And from that great distance

or in some imaginary elsewhere
And we could inhabit the room easy

in the form filled offered in trust
