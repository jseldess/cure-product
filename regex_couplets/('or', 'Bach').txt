('or', 'Bach')

into the minority proportion of time
I end up in Bach 

though we are waiting for her
I end up in Bach and Selma

Formerly a way like this one
I end up Bach

But my not feeling the memory inside
Bach helps turn it off

Though we canâ€™t help waiting for her
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

formerly a way
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

By my feeling the memory inside
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

Formerly away there are constant ways
I end up Bach forty-one seconds in

Forty-one seconds in
I end up in Bach with no way 

Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor
and end up in Bach

formerly my way
