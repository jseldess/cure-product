('or', 'but')

into the minority proportion of time
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

Before we walk across the wide field
but not impart cynicism

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Attributable or

Assimilable or
but the sun isn’t up

Strategy comes before goals
but it continued

tomorrow
but it continued rippling muscle

off the end of the world
but would I love her the same

where you can earn more 
but they are black spots

as far back as my history heard
but I can hear them

the simple act of honoring an accountant
I resume attributable visions

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
but where is it

You need history
attributable visions

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
that decisions can be attributable

though we are waiting for her
but for memory elsewhere

in memory persisting elsewhere
but standing in memory

shone formerly along time
decisions that can be attributable

own best form
revisions that can be attributable

for a while to listen already
but I own all that’s messageable

The prospect for careening attached
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
in that decisions can be attributable

seen having or offering possession
