('or', 'For')

into the minority proportion of time
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

For whom drifting is not an exception
For whom 

or currents of air
Forecasting the story before dawn

or an available resource
For an ungraspable time

If articles can storm in excess
For an ungraspable purchase

And for an ungraspable time
For Mitt Romney

nor work in this way daily
For my own purchases

But my not feeling the memory aside
Formerly a way like this one

Though we are waiting for her
Formerly away there are constant ways

But my not feeling the memory inside
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

formerly a way
Forty-one seconds in

Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

The prospect for careening attached
