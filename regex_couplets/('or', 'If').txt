('or', 'if')

into the minority proportion of time
drifting away

Before we walk across the wide field
if not directly on my skin

Before anyone walks across the opening
drifting does not feel an exception

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
For whom drifting is not an exception

For whom 
What does it mean to drift

or currents of air
drifting away needs

There are performance reviews
drifting away needs others presume desires

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
if you have providence to excess

The world 
if he had not carried one virtue 

nor work in this way daily
out of the fifth page ruins

tomorrow
learned without too much difficulty to code

Having transitioned from leisure to work
That company creates a life

that potential is there for you
Life is with people

off the end of the world
If I take a different measure

where you can earn more 
If I take some different measure

hauling off the end of the world
if there is anything 

I have a memory between the day
if you have providence

But my not feeling the memory aside
if that has anything

which feels more comfortable
if only on the way to the trash

for a while to listen already
