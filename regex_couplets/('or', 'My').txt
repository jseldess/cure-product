('or', 'My')

into the minority proportion of time
My live connections to you

off the edge of the world
My associations

or argued for them at least
My purpose up in the sky

For an ungraspable time
My means without gravity

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
My daughter with her way

Though we are waiting for her
My daughter helps too

But my not feeling the memory inside
My say to the elections

Aligned or not with my interests
My state kept loaned impression

into an oral
My void

own best form
