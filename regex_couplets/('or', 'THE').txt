('or', 'THE')

into the minority proportion of time
THE SNOW

off the edge of the world
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

But in more 
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

to be before the sun
THE PLANNING PROCESS

Strategy comes before morning
UPSET IN THE AFTERNOON

It’s morning 
THE OFFERS

tomorrow
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
