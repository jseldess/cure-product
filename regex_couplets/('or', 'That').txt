('or', 'That')

into the minority proportion of time
That’s exaclty what I want for them

Before anyone has walked across the field
That is itself not still

or not even rotating
That’s where I sleep at times

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
That’s when they really take

hold at intervals riding forward
That you can see only the back of

oddly grown over with historic bark
That company creates a life

that potential is there for you
That I captured an afterimage

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
That are my right to say

Aligned or not with my interests
