('or', 'There')

into the minority proportion of time
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
There are quarterly goals

There are performance reviews
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
There was very little physical activity

or argued for them at least
There are spots waiting

or in some imaginary elsewhere
There are constant ways

Formerly a way like this one
There are no constant waves

But my not feeling the memory inside
There are no constant ways

By my feeling the memory inside
