('or', 'To')

into the minority proportion of time
To my children Walt Whitman

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
To my chidren

For whom drifting is not an exception
To my children

For whom 
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
To neither study

nor work in this way daily
To that impossible place

off the edge of the world
Tomorrow

before morning goals
Toward the start informally given my reasons

So I work and donâ€™t look any
To substitute neither study

nor envy honest work
To the ends of transactions

though we are waiting for her
To the ends of my transactions

formerly a way like this one
To the other end of transactions

But my not feeling the memory inside
To the other end of my actions

By my feeling the memory inside
To the other end of transactions like this

formerly a way
To the right of determined elections

Aligned or not with my interests
