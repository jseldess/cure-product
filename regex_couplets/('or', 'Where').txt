('or', 'Where')

into the minority proportion of time
Where I sleep at times

off the edge of the world
Where official policy is to catch and release

to be before the sun
Where I take my liesure

tomorrow
Where I lead gravity

And for an ungraspable time
Where I need gravity

I click or my zipcode
Where in me did I host

in the form filled offered in trust
Where I host my purposes

and elsewhere my memory
Where in me did I last

Elsewhere by my memory
Where I stand and relive

already formerly a long time
Where in me did I lose

washed by my memory
Where in me did I loose

in the form filled offered trust
Where in me pre-worn

by my memory
Where in me did I lose trust

in the form filled offered
Where did I lose trust in me

though we are waiting for her
