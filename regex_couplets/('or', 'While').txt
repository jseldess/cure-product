('or', 'while')

into the minority proportion of time
Looking back while I should be sleeping

at intervals while riding forward
while wrapped in static

as far back as my history heard
while wrapped in explicit static

for to tire as far back as my history
while we’re wrapped in static

for as far back as my history
while consuming damage

And for an ungraspable time
I answered while interfaced

but for memory elsewhere
for a while to listen already

for a while to listen 
for a while not to listen

For a while I think I don’t listen
