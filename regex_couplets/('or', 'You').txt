('or', 'You')

into the minority proportion of time
You should ask who I am

off the edge of the world
You can hear it also through your leisure

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
You use the most essential parts

Even before the lesson starts
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

the simple act of honoring an accountant
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

as far back as my history heard
You can hear it also through static leisure

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
You need history

for an explicit state
You can have seen offering

and maybe forgettable
