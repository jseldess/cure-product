('or', 'about')

into the minority proportion of time
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

Before we walk across the wide field
about my childrenâ€™s consumption

Before we walk across the wide opening
burrowed about from repeated travels

But my not feeling the memory aside
and literally moved about

and for which the plan agreed
answered about 

in the form filled offered in trust
about the site

by my memory 
about the sight hosting trusting

in the form filled offered trust
I answered about

By my memory elsewhere
which I feel formerly about for

washed by my memory
not literally moved about

But my not feeling the memory inside
I answered what I thought about

but standing in memory
about 

Aligned or not with my interests
