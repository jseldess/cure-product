('or', 'across')

into the minority proportion of time
Before we walk across the wide field

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
Before we walk across the wide opening

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Before anyone walks across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the field

or the incoming stream
across the retinas

or argued for them at least
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

I walk up and don’t work anymore
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

seen having or offering possession
