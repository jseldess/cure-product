('or', 'act')

into the minority proportion of time
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Before we walk across the wide opening
In the retroactive light

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
In the light of retroactive

before we can have a retroactive
One day was actually

for how can I know without direction
I was enjoined to act again myself

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I was enjoined to act again

before the sun’s deflections
and strategies not tactics

the planning process for decisions
Not goals or tactics

The planning process is for visionaries only
I am bid to act again

off the end of the world
I am enjoined to act again

tomorrow
I was bid to act again myself

or argued for them at least
There was very little physical activity

The days aligned for company
I was big to act again

that potential is there for you
actually considering the end

as far back as my history heard
I refuse indelible tracts

I need the work
though not many facts up in the sky

though as for conversing
Though in not many acts

the simple act of honoring an accountant
the simple act of opening surmounted

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
we had inhabited actually

or alter of course the time anyway
to the ends of my transactions

I have a memory between the day
The ends of my transactions

But my not feeling the memory inside
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

in the form filled offered in trust
To the ends of transactions

though we are waiting for her
to the ends of actions

A way formerly like this one
It’s not marshal exactly

Though we can’t help waiting for her
the other end transactions

formerly a way
to the other end of actions

Formerly a way like this one
It’s not marshall exactly

Formerly away there are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

By my feeling the memory inside
the other end of actions

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
actions

formerly away
to the other end of transactions

Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor
I turn not sad exactly

By my memory elsewhere
I return not sad exactly

Aligned or not with my interests
I returned not sad exactly

which I feel formerly about for
before I act on them

own best form to ourselves
