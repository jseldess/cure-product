('or', 'actions')

into the minority proportion of time
conversations with our reactions

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
to the ends of my transactions

I have a memory between the day
The ends of my transactions

But my not feeling the memory inside
To the ends of transactions

though we are waiting for her
to the ends of actions

A way formerly like this one
the other end transactions

Though we canâ€™t help waiting for her
to the other end of actions

formerly a way
of my actions

Formerly a way like this one
The other end of transactions like this

By my feeling the memory inside
the other end of actions

Formerly away there are constant ways
To the other end of transactions like this

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
actions

formerly away
to the other end of transactions
