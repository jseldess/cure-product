('or', 'agreed')

into the minority proportion of time
and to which I’ve agreed

by my memory
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

found dated for my own purchases
and for which the plan agreed

which feels most comfortable
that agreed one of rest

in the form filled offered in trust
and to which the plan agreed

it can be uncomfortable 
that agreed home

own best form
that agreed to one the people

own best form to ourselves
that agreed one best

the people in home form
that agreed home to people

home rest form to ourselves
