('or', 'along')

into the minority proportion of time
bring your child along

or currents of air
The days lined along company

that potential is there for you
there was no walking along the pleasure

tomorrow
there was no walking along

where you can earn more 
and continue along having 

and support digestion
because there was no solid ground to continue along

off the end of the world
formerly along time they were on

Having seen more than 
formerly along my say to the elections

formerly my way to the elections
drawn formerly along 

drawn formerly a long time
along cables

But my not feeling the memory aside
mostly along cables

at least for the duration of the answer
shone formerly along time

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
formerly along the time they were on

Aligned or not with my interests
