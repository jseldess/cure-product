('or', 'already')

into the minority proportion of time
So I presume the offers already

off the edge of the world
already formerly a long time

I have a memory between the day
dawn already formerly nights 

formerly a long time they were on
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

found dated for my own purchases
already formely a long time

in the form filled offered in trust
with dawn already formerly nights 

by my memory
already brought into privacy

own best form to ourselves
The prospects there already

for a while to listen already
So I presume the offers at home already

for a while to listen
