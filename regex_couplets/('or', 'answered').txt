('or', 'answered')

into the minority proportion of time
answered about 

But my not feeling the memory aside
by the sight of the hosting answered about

by my memory 
I answered about

By my memory elsewhere
washed I answered about

washed by my memory
I answered what I thought

shone formerly a long time
I answered while interfaced

but for memory elsewhere
I answered what I thought about

but standing in memory
