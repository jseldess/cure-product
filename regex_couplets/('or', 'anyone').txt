('or', 'anyone')

into the minority proportion of time
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

before we can have a retroactive
Before anyone buys up the opening

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
Before anyone walks across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the field

or the incoming stream
