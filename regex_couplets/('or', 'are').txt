('or', 'are')

into the minority proportion of time
Though there are quarters goals

for how can I know without direction
there are quarters 

or not even rotating
who are so fresh and agile

or currents of air
There are quarterly goals

There are performance reviews
barely outlines

before morning goals
They are called aspirational

your bid to the next highest ranked network
The days are long

or argued for them at least
I had nightmares though

The days aligned for company
but they are black spots

off the end of the world
I believe I can prepare for it

tomorrow
There are spots waiting

or in some imaginary elsewhere
Though we are waiting for her

already formerly a long time
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

A way formerly like this one
though we are breaking in the space that it had

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
Though we are breaking 

already formely a long time
Though we are waiting 

which feels most comfortable
still carefully

Where in me pre-worn
There are constant ways

Formerly a way like this one
Formerly away there are constant ways

But my not feeling the memory inside
The many transparent pixel calls

By my feeling the memory inside
That are my right to say

Aligned or not with my interests
careening between the preambles

The prospect for careening attached
The prospect for careening healthily

The prospect for seeing healthily
