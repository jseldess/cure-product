('or', 'around')

into the minority proportion of time
Spinning around the heart

off the edge of the world
around my country 

You need history
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

missing words
Articles all around us

storing in surfeit
articles all around storming around

Articles all around stores in surfeit
around the dogs and lillies

And for an ungraspable time
I spin around

I have supporters
around 

having supporters 
I spun around trying to touch the spots

or in some imaginary elsewhere
More reasons around my country 

and elsewhere my memory of you
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

for my own purchases
and around redundant

the opinions in my world
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

But my not feeling the memory inside
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

Though we canâ€™t help waiting for her
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

formerly a way
