('or', 'assume')

into the minority proportion of time
I assumed it was visible

off the edge of the world
I assumed 

dawn already formerly nights 
I assumed what I draw

formerly along time they were on
I assume the offers reliable

before I act on them
I assume the offers revisitable

Having seen more than I can remember 
I assumed that they were divisible

seen having or offering possession
I assume possession to others

and maybe forgettable
I assume the offers divisible
