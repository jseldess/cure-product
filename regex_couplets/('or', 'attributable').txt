into the minority proportion of time
I resume attributable visions

as far back as my history heard
attributable visions

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
that decisions can be attributable

though we are waiting for her
decisions that can be attributable

own best form
revisions that can be attributable

for a while to listen already
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
in that decisions can be attributable

seen having or offering possession
