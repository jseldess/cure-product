('or', 'away')

into the minority proportion of time
drifting away

Before we walk across the wide field
drifting away needs others presume desires

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
drifting away needs

There are performance reviews
drifting away from the task

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
Who throws contours away

Formerly a way like this one
Formerly away there are constant ways

But my not feeling the memory inside
formerly away

I end up Bach forty-one seconds in
