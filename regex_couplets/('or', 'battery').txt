('or', 'battery')

into the minority proportion of time
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Before we walk across the wide opening
battery dawn nights 

But my not feeling the memory inside
to the other end battery dawn 

formerly a way
battery dawn 

Formerly a way like this one
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

By my feeling the memory inside
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in memory elsewhere
