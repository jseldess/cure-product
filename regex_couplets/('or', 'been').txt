('or', 'been')

into the minority proportion of time
It has been since

But in more 
After having been contented

or available
that having been after content

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning
having been graspable

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
having been an ungraspable time

missing words
having been purchased out

With a fervor 
having been purchased out of you

storing in surfeit
