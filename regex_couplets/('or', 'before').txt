('or', 'Before')

into the minority proportion of time
Before we walk across the wide field

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
Before we walk across the wide opening

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Before anyone buys up the opening

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
Before anyone walks across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the field

or the incoming stream
Before morning goals

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

It’s morning
