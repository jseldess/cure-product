('or', 'bills')

into the minority proportion of time
between bills and stuffed animals

off the edge of the world
I hear it between bills and stuff

to be before the sun
I can hear it between bills and stuff

off the end of the world
I can hear them between bills and stuff

Tomorrow
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

the simple act of honoring an accountant
bills and stuffed animals

for a while to listen already
