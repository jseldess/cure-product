('or', 'breaking')

into the minority proportion of time
though we are still breaking in

Though we are waiting for her
though we are breaking in the space that it had

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
Though we are breaking 

already formely a long time
without really breaking

for my own purchases
breaking from my constituents

But my not feeling the memory inside
