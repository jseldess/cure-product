('or', 'brought')

into the minority proportion of time
at home brought into privacy

off the edge of the world
I brought my head down

to be before the sun
I brought my qualities down

Even before the lesson starts
which I brought down with qualities

hold at intervals riding forward
I brought my count down

at intervals while riding forward
own stays brought loyal

in the form filled offered in trust
own that stays brought loyal

phase decision for learning
that stays brought loyal

for learning by the prospect
already brought into privacy

own best form to ourselves
home stays brought loyal

the people in home form
brought messageable to you

for a while to listen already
brought messageable into privacy

for a while to listen
