('or', 'came')

into the minority proportion of time
I invited most of what came next

or argued for them at least
I came back to me

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
I came after my past

missing words
until the bill came

full of the missing words
and came home to rewind inflections

before I act on them
and came home to rewind

Having seen more than I can remember
