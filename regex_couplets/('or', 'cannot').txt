('or', 'cannot')

into the minority proportion of time
Then I cannot see face value

off the edge of the world
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I need the work
I cannot clear it also through investiture

though as for conversing
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

the simple act of honoring an accountant
in that I cannot remember 

before I act on them
