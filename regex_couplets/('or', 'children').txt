('or', 'children')

into the minority proportion of time
On a snow day with my children

Before we walk across the wide field
as pure as my children

I told her a story, she drew waves.
my children’s consumption

not calling or echoing for once
about my children’s consumption

Before we walk across the wide opening
only fragments of time with my children

for how can I know without direction
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
To my children Walt Whitman

For whom drifting is not an exception
To my children

For whom 
bearing children along

or currents of air
Even the children

For an ungraspable time
my possession of my children

forgetting decisions 
speech my possession of my children

phase decision for learning
