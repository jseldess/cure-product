('or', 'clear')

into the minority proportion of time
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I need the work
I cannot clear it also through investiture

though as for conversing
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

the simple act of honoring an accountant
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

as far back as my history heard
