('or', 'constant')

into the minority proportion of time
with constant ways 

Though we are waiting for her
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

formerly a way
who throws a constant way

Formerly a way like this one
There are constant ways

Formerly away there are constant ways
with no constant way

But my not feeling the memory inside
with no constant ways 

By my feeling the memory inside
with constant ways to the other end

Forty-one seconds in
