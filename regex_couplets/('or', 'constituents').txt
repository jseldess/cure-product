('or', 'constituents')

into the minority proportion of time
The constituents would be helped

for my own purchases
The constituents 

Elsewhere my memory
to constituents

already formely a long time
the constituents should rise up

already formerly a long time
breaking from my constituents

But my not feeling the memory inside
from my constituents

the opinions in my world
