('or', 'continue')

into the minority proportion of time
but it continued

tomorrow
but it continued rippling muscle

off the end of the world
no solid ground to continue along

where you can earn more 
and continue along having 

and support digestion
because there was no solid ground to continue along

hauling off the end of the world
I continue to presume

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
I continue to consume

missing words
Then I continued to dream then

With a fervor 
Then I continue to dream then

storing in surfeit
I continued to dream then

And for an ungraspable time
