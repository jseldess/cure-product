('or', 'could')

into the minority proportion of time
and could be mapped and weighed

off the edge of the world
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

hold at intervals riding forward
until I could not tire 

though as for conversing
until I could not be tired

as far back as my history heard
until I could not be hired

for as far back as my history
I could in effect credit

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
I could consume the dream

missing words
and we could inhabit the room easy

or alter of course the time anyway
and could be inflected with reasons

before I act on them
