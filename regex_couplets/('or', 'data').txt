('or', 'data')

into the minority proportion of time
I’ll pull my data higher up

to be before the sun
I’ll pull my data

over the long line I would honor
The days of private data

that potential is there for you
The days of public data

tomorrow
trackers collecting data on users

washed my memory
my interfaced stand data

By my memory elsewhere
my standing in data

but for memory elsewhere
