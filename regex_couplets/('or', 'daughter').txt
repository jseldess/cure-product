('or', 'daughter')

into the minority proportion of time
I love my daughter still

tomorrow
with my daughter

though we are waiting for her
my daughter will learn 

sizes track for asking sound
My daughter with her way

A way formerly like this one
My daughter helps too

But my not feeling the memory inside
my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me

By my memory elsewhere
