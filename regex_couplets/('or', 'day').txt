('or', 'day')

into the minority proportion of time
On a snow day with my children

Before we walk across the wide field
One day there is direction

Before anyone walks across the opening
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

for how can I know without direction
I argued the days felt longer

The planning process is for visionaries only
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

off the end of the world
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

tomorrow
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

or argued for them at least
The days aligned for company

that potential is there for you
The days are long

where you can earn more 
The day

or alter of course the time anyway
between that day

already formerly a long time
I have a memory between the day

in the form filled offered in trust
at least most days

But my not feeling the memory aside
