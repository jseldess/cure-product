('or', 'days')

into the minority proportion of time
I argued the days felt longer

The planning process is for visionaries only
The days long aligned

off the end of the world
I agrued the days were longer

tomorrow
I argued the days were longer

or argued for them at least
The days aligned for company

that potential is there for you
The days are long

where you can earn more 
at least most days

But my not feeling the memory aside
