('or', 'decisions')

into the minority proportion of time
the planning process for decisions

The planning process for visions
attributable decisions

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
forgetting decisions 

in the form filled offered in trust
that decisions can be attributable

though we are waiting for her
decisions that can be attributable

own best form
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
in that decisions can be attributable

seen having or offering possession
