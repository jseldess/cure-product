('or', 'desires')

into the minority proportion of time
others desires

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
If I let myself see others desires

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
Others desires as legitimate

off the edge of the world
my desires were open

to be before the sun
I wish my desires were open

hold at intervals riding forward
