('or', 'direction')

into the minority proportion of time
Whereas direction is beside the point

off the edge of the world
into rotating directionless 

Before we walk across the wide field
Of course there is a direction

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
One day there is direction

Before anyone walks across the opening
on a day there will be direction

for how can I know without direction
in rotating directionless space

or not even rotating
for how can you know without direction

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
stopping off in all directions

seen having or offering possession
