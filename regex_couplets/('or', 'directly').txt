('or', 'directly')

into the minority proportion of time
if not directly on my skin

Before anyone walks across the opening
of not directly from my skin

or the incoming stream
But not to me directly

off the edge of the world
The sun high enough to enter directly 

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
The sun high enough to strike directly

seen having or offering possession
