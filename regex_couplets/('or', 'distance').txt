('or', 'distance')

into the minority proportion of time
Falling from this distance

Before we walk across the wide opening
A person from a distance

off the edge of the world
And from a weak distance

And for an ungraspable time
And from that great distance

missing words
And from a great distance

or in some imaginary elsewhere
