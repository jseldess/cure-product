('or', 'do')

into the minority proportion of time
The dogs and lillies

off the edge of the world
in a sharp downward turn 

Before we walk across the wide field
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

I told her a story, she drew waves.
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

When I woke up in the morning
In a sharp downard turn

Before we walk across the wide opening
It keeps coming down thankfully

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
does not feel an exception

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
What does it mean to drift

or currents of air
to the down arrow

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I brought my head down

to be before the sun
I brought my qualities down

Even before the lesson starts
which I brought down with qualities

hold at intervals riding forward
I put my bread down

at intervals while riding forward
I brought my count down

rewind before the sun
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

Strategy comes before morning
What I do in my liesure

tomorrow
Undoubtedly 

where you can earn more 
I walk up and don’t work anymore

Toward the start informally given my reasons
So I work and don’t look any

More reasons 
here is the site of the battle of maldon

missing words
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

And for an ungraspable time
around the dogs and lillies

I have supporters
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

I click or my zipcode
One was up where it should be down

Is the weight of my click or zipcode
and it doesn’t take long

But my not feeling the memory aside
latency which doesn’t mean anything

useless for not having paid
I only think I don’t listen

For a while I think I don’t listen
