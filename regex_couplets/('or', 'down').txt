('or', 'down')

into the minority proportion of time
in a sharp downward turn 

Before we walk across the wide field
In a sharp downard turn

Before we walk across the wide opening
It keeps coming down thankfully

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
to the down arrow

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I brought my head down

off the edge of the world
I brought my qualities down

to be before the sun
which I brought down with qualities

hold at intervals riding forward
I put my bread down

at intervals while riding forward
I brought my count down

rewind before the sun
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

I click or my zipcode
One was up where it should be down

And for an ungraspable time
