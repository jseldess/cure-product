('or', 'drifting')

into the minority proportion of time
drifting away

Before we walk across the wide field
drifting does not feel an exception

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
For whom drifting is not an exception

For whom

or currents of air
drifting away needs

There are performance reviews
drifting away needs others presume desires

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
