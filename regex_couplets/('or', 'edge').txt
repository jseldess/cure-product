('or', 'edge')

into the minority proportion of time
I step off the edge

off the edge of the world
Face falling off the edge of the face

Before we walk across the wide opening
value falling off the edge of the face

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
The edge is put in place

or not even rotating
If I step over the edge

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Falling off the edge of the face

to be before the sun
The value falling off the edge of th face

over the long line I would honor
and testing the edge and gravity

The planning process is for visionaries only
