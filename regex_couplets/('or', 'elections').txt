('or', 'elections')

into the minority proportion of time
on my way to elections

Having seen more than 
formerly my way to the elections

shone formerly a long time
on a way to the elections

formally a way to the elections
formerly along my say to the elections

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
My say to the elections

Aligned or not with my interests
I stay the right of my elections

which I feel formerly about for
stay to my elections

behind or out front or up above
