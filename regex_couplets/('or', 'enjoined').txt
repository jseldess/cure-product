('or', 'enjoined')

into the minority proportion of time
I was enjoined to act again myself

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I was enjoined to act again

before the sunâ€™s deflections
I was enjoined to act

off the end of the world
I am enjoined to act again

tomorrow
I was enjoined to act against

or argued for them at least
