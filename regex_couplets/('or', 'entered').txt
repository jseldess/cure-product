('or', 'entered')

into the minority proportion of time
I have entered my phone

Before we walk across the wide opening
I have entered my purposes

and elsewhere my memory of you
I have entered my purchases

But my not feeling the memory aside
entered into my purposes

washed my memory
I had entered my phone

By my memory elsewhere
