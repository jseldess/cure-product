('or', 'fall')

into the minority proportion of time
Then fall then summer from my face

not calling or echoing for once
and not falling at all

Before we walk across the wide opening
Face falling off the edge of the face

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Then fall then summer

before we can have a retroactive
value falling off the edge of the face

There are performance reviews
The value falling off the edge of the face

to be before the sun
The value falling off the edge of th face

over the long line I would honor
I see only the back of falling values

The planning process for visions
I see the back of falling values

The planning process is for visionaries only
I can see only the back of falling values

oddly grown over with historic bark
falling off the encoded end

tomorrow
I take it out in the snow fall

off the end of the world
falling off the end

hauling off the end of the world
falling off the end of the world

I believe I can prepare for it
The first falling syllable

falling off the end of the word
I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking

as far back as my history heard
