('or', 'far')

into the minority proportion of time
as far as I can see

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
as far back as my history heard

Tomorrow
for to tire as far back as my history

you need history
for as far back as my history

until I purpose the horizon
in welfare and hope

Aligned or not with my interests
