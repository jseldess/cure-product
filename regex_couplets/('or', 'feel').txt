('or', 'feel')

into the minority proportion of time
conversations with our feelings

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
conversation with our feelings

before we can have a retroactive
does not feel an exception

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
I tried to feel the key values extending 

The planning process is for visionaries only
I tried to feel the extension of key values

oddly grown over with historic bark
when trying to feel the extension of key values

off the end of the world
What would I feel without that goal

tomorrow
But my not feeling the memory aside

the impulse for my own prospects
But my not feeling the memory inside

for my own purchases
which feels most comfortable

in the form filled offered in trust
which feels more comfortable

The floor slanted in places
which is what feels most comfortable

Elsewhere by my memory
which I feel formerly about for

washed by my memory
By my feeling the memory inside

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
But my feeling the memory aside

at least for the duration of the answer
