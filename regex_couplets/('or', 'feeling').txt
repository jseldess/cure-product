('or', 'feeling')

into the minority proportion of time
conversations with our feelings

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
conversation with our feelings

before we can have a retroactive
But my not feeling the memory aside

the impulse for my own prospects
But my not feeling the memory inside

for my own purchases
By my feeling the memory inside

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
But my feeling the memory aside

at least for the duration of the answer
