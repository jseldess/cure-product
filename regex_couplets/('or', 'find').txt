('or', 'find')

into the minority proportion of time
So I find myself at home

off the edge of the world
I want to find a way to block it incoming

Before anyone buys up the opening
I want to find a way to block it

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
I can find a way to block it incoming

Before anyone walks across the opening
I can find a way to block incoming 

Before anyone has walked across the opening
I can find a way to block it in the incoming stream

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
I can find a way to block it

or the incoming stream
with goals I find there

or not even rotating
what I find there

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Companies increasingly find 

oddly grown over with historic bark
I even know what I would find

I believe I can prepare for it
