washed my memory
found dated for my own purchases

sound inundated for my own purchases
and found inundated

for my own purchases
and found redundant

already formerly a long time
and latency found

the opinions in my world
until a happier time found

useless for not having paid
So I found myself at home

for a while to listen already
