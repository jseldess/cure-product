('or', 'front')

into the minority proportion of time
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

off the edge of the world
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Its strategy comes before morning goals
in front of the set afternoon

The planning process is for visionaries only
in front of the set of regulations

oddly grown over with historic bark
And need out in front purchase

For an ungraspable time
And read out in front

For an ungraspable purchase
behind or out front or up above

or imagined anyway
out front

waiting out front or up above 
in the space out front

waiting out front or up above or behind
in the fill space out front

or behind
