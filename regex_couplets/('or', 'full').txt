('or', 'full')

into the minority proportion of time
It keeps coming down thankfully

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
I am full of potential

or argued for them at least
with full potential to movement

The days aligned for company
full of aspirations

that potential is there for you
full of potential

tomorrow
full of the missing words

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
still carefully

Where in me pre-worn
