('or', 'get')

into the minority proportion of time
I’ll get there eventually

Before we walk across the wide field
and is relentlessly budgeted

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
I’ll get there ruins

off the edge of the world
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Its strategy comes before morning goals
I get through there

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
forgetting decisions 

in the form filled offered in trust
forgettable

before I act on them
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
and maybe forgettable

seen having or offering possession
