('or', 'goals')

into the minority proportion of time
Though there are quarters goals

for how can I know without direction
We can wrestle them with their goals

or not even rotating
and without quartely goals

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
There are quarterly goals

There are performance reviews
before morning goals

Tomorrow
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

Itâ€™s morning 
Its strategy comes before morning goals

Strategy comes before goals
not goals

the planning process for decisions
Not goals or tactics

The planning process is for visionaries only
