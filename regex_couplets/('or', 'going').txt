('or', 'going')

into the minority proportion of time
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Before we walk across the wide field
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

tomorrow
The way that she is going

A way formerly like this one
The way that I am going

But my not feeling the memory inside
The way that I was going

Though we are waiting for her
way I was going 

I end up Bach forty-one seconds in
A way I was going

formerly a way
