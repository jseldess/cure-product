('or', 'grasp')

into the minority proportion of time
having been graspable

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
having been an ungraspable time

missing words
Under the grasp principle

With a fervor 
for an ungraspable purchase

For an ungraspable time
And for an ungraspable time

I have supporters
