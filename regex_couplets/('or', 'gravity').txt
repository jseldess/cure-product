('or', 'gravity')

into the minority proportion of time
and testing the edge and gravity

The planning process is for visionaries only
where I need gravity

And for an ungraspable time
Where I lead gravity

I have supporters
I tell you where I need gravity

Is the weight of my click or zipcode
that nothing had gravity

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
