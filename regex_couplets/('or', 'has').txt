('or', 'has')

into the minority proportion of time
conversations with our purchase

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Before anyone has walked across the opening

That’s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field

or the incoming stream
It has been since

But in more 
in traversing my purchase

tomorrow
purchased out

missing words
having been purchased out

With a fervor 
having been purchased out of you

storing in surfeit
Under the last principle of purchasing power

for an ungraspable purchase
And need out in front purchase

For an ungraspable time
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I have supporters
until I purchase up the sky

having supporters 
until I purchase the sky

or in some imaginary elsewhere
Is the weight of my purchases

Is the weight of my click or zipcode
if that has anything

I have a memory between the day
I have entered my purchases

But my not feeling the memory aside
the impulse for my own purchases

and elsewhere my memory 
washed my purchases

Though we are waiting for her
for my own purchases

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
found dated for my own purchases

sound inundated for my own purchases
All parties would be held for my own purchases

already formely a long time
impulse for my own purchases

the impulse for my own purposes
phase decisioned by the prospect

phase decision for learning
phase decision step in

for learning by the prospect
converting sight into a purchase

A way formerly like this one
He has turned it off

But my not feeling the memory inside
phase decisioned

a precision for learning
at the site of a purchase

for my own purposes
which as tracked befitted phased

sizes track for asking sound
