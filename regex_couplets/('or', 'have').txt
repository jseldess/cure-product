('or', 'have')

into the minority proportion of time
Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning

off the edge of the world
I have entered my phone

Before we walk across the wide opening
before we can have a retroactive

Before anyone buys up the opening
as long as I have access to the code

or the incoming stream
if you have providence to excess

The world 
If you have confidence regardless all else

in short
May I have your zip code

to be before the sun
I have them lost

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
I have supporters

And for an ungraspable time
I have a memory between the day

in the form filled offered in trust
I have entered my purposes

and elsewhere my memory of you
I have entered my purchases

But my not feeling the memory aside
They have very many choices

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

Elsewhere by my memory
I have turned it off

Formerly a way like this one
and have no way

By my feeling the memory inside
I have them trust in me

for my own purposes
I have seen more than I can remember

seen having or offering possession
can have seen offering possession

and maybe forgettable
Or can have seen offering possession
