('or', 'head')

into the minority proportion of time
Without a head

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
I brought my head down

off the edge of the world
with my head

to be before the sun
I search with my head

hold at intervals riding forward
I put my head down

at intervals while riding forward
I log in and search with my head

rewind before the sun
into the next level head

The planning process is for visionaries only
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

in the form filled offered in trust
