('or', 'hear')

into the minority proportion of time
You can hear it also through your leisure

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
and my heart rate

off the edge of the world
and my heartrate

to be before the sun
I hear it between bills and stuff

Forecasting the story before dawn
I can hear it between bills and stuff

off the end of the world
that I can hear

hauling off the end of the world
as far back as my history heard

Tomorrow
that I hear without trying

falling off the end of the word
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I need the work
but I can hear them

the simple act of honoring an accountant
You can hear it also through static leisure

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
In my heart did I lose trust

though we are waiting for her
