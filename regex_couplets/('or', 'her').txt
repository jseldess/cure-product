('or', 'her')

into the minority proportion of time
Where I sleep at times

off the edge of the world
I’ll get there eventually

Before we walk across the wide field
I told her a story, she drew waves.

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
Of course there is a direction

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
One day there is direction

Before anyone walks across the opening
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

for how can I know without direction
The edge isn’t even there

or not even rotating
what I find there

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
I’ll pull myself another personality type

There are performance reviews
here described

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
others desires

to be before the sun
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Which can be pronounced to the world
To neither study

nor work in this way daily
Where official policy is to catch and release

Even before the lesson starts
higher up in the results

rewind before the sun
I’ll get there ruins

tomorrow
I’ll pull myself higher up

or an available resource
I’ll pull my data higher up

over the long line I would honor
there was no promotion

off the end of the world
There was very little physical activity

or argued for them at least
that potential is there for you

where you can earn more 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

hauling off the end of the world
Where I take my liesure

falling off the end of the world
On the other hand

I need the work
there was no television to hear

the simple act of honoring an accountant
but where is it

You need history
I get through there

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

missing words
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

With a fervor 
And we had to say goodbye to her there

for an ungraspable purchase
We had to say goodbye there

If articles can storm in excess
We had to buy there

For an ungraspable time
 of those gathered

And for an ungraspable time
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I have supporters
where I need gravity

having supporters 
There are spots waiting

I click or my zipcode
One was up where it should be down

Is the weight of my click or zipcode
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

full of the missing words
here is the site of the battle of maldon

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
Though we are waiting for her

already formerly a long time
Where in me did I host

in the form filled offered in trust
Elsewhere by my memory

washed by my memory
if there is anything 

I have a memory between the day
Where I host my purposes

and elsewhere my memory
and other types of tracking technology

For Mitt Romney
To substitute neither study

nor envy honest work
Please neither study

nor envy honestly
and elsewhere my memory of you

But my not feeling the memory aside
where I send and relive aside

the impulse for my own prospects
where I end

the impulse for my own purposes
where I stand aside

Elsewhere my memory
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

washed my memory
elsewhere my purposes

A way formerly like this one
where I send and relive would be held

found dated for my own purchases
where I stand and relive

sound inundated for my own purchases
Where in me did I last

For my own purchases
where I send and retrieve aside

already formely a long time
where I send and relive

But my not feeling the memory inside
where I stand and retrieve

between the drug store and the 
where I am aside at least

for the duration of the answer
the point where I am

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I send and retrieve relive

for the duration of answers
where I blend and relive

the opinions in my world
I presume to others

worn as it was designed
there wasn’t any television 

pre-worn in me
Where in me did I lose

by my memory
Where in me did I loose

in the form filled offered trust
where in me pre-worn

pre-worn and still wash them
By my memory elsewhere

which I feel formerly about for
after though there’s no memory

in the form filled offered must
Where in me did I lose trust

in the form filled offered
Where did I lose trust in me

dawn already formerly nights 
with her waves

Formerly a way like this one
to the other end

Though we can’t help waiting for her
with her way to the ends

formerly a way
to the other end of actions

Formerly away there are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

By my feeling the memory inside
There are constant ways

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
the other end transactions

formerly away
with constant ways to the other end

Forty-one seconds in
to the other end of transactions

Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor
on the other end

formerly my way 
where rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
where I stand aside and retrieve

dawn formerly
where I stand and retrieve and relive

for the duration of the universe
firing and connecting somewhere

at least for the duration of the answer
in memory elsewhere

but for memory elsewhere
in memory persisting elsewhere

addition were filters formerly
where lights blended themselves

drawn formerly along 
Cereal and others’ health

Aligned or not with my interests
I learned the point where I am

for my own purposes
where the tongue rippled

into an oral
The prospects there already

own best form to ourselves
The offers there already

for a while to listen already
traffick is there nonetheless

The prospect for careening attached
I assume possession to others

and maybe forgettable
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
