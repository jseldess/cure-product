('or', 'high')

into the minority proportion of time
way high up in the inter

to be before the sun
higher up in the results

rewind before the sun
high in the content architecture

tomorrow
I’ll pull myself higher up

or an available resource
high up in the internet

for the length of the sun
I’ll pull my data higher up

over the long line I would honor
your bid to the next highest ranked network

the next network in your ranking
The sun high enough to enter directly 

I walk up and don’t work anymore
The sun high enough to strike directly

seen having or offering possession
