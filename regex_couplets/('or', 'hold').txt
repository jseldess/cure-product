('or', 'hold')

into the minority proportion of time
I take hold of my finger

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
When they really take hold of my finger

hold at intervals riding forward
Since I had to hold the entire company

tomorrow
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

or argued for them at least
and hold and wish to hold

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
designed to hold up my underwear

I have supporters
I designed them to hold up my underwear

having supporters 
that hold and wish to hold

And for an ungraspable time
