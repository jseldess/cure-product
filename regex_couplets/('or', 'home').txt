('or', 'home')

into the minority proportion of time
at home brought into privacy

off the edge of the world
promoting from home to a new job

where you can earn more 
from home

tomorrow
that agreed home

own best form
and came home to rewind inflections

before I act on them
So I find myself at home

own best form to ourselves
home stays brought loyal

the people in home form
that agreed home to people

home rest form to ourselves 
So I found myself at home

for a while to listen already
So I presume the offers at home already

for a while to listen 
I resume the offers at home

for a while not to listen
and came home to rewind

Having seen more than I can remember 
and come home to remind inflections

seen having or offering possession
