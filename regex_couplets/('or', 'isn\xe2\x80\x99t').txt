into the minority proportion of time
The sun isn’t up 

We’ll have coffee this morning
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

Before we walk across the wide field
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
The edge isn’t even there

or not even rotating
Then the sun isn’t available

to be before the sun
Then the sun isn’t up 

or available
but the sun isn’t up

Strategy comes before goals
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

The planning process for visions
