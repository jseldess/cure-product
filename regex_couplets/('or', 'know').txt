('or', 'know')

into the minority proportion of time
who knows the way

Before we walk across the wide opening
how can I know without direction

for how can I know without direction
Though how can you know without direction

or not even rotating
for how can you know without direction

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
I even know what I would find

I believe I can prepare for it
even when close to my knowing

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
knowing the constituents

the opinions in my world
who knows how to turn it off

Though we are waiting for her
who know the ways to their other end

But my not feeling the memory inside
who know the way to their other end

By my feeling the memory inside
that their knowing

into an oral
