('or', 'last')

into the minority proportion of time
What was the last time

Tomorrow
under the last seen principle

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
Under the last principle 

storing in surfeit
Under the last principle of purchasing power

for an ungraspable purchase
Where in me did I last

in the form filled offered in trust
last night

the opinions in my world
