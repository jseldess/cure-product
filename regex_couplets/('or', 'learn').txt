('or', 'learn')

into the minority proportion of time
in light of learning what we see

before we can have a retroactive
I spend time online learning to code

off the edge of the world
learned without too much difficulty to code

Having transitioned from leisure to work
Then I am learning to code

Strategy comes before morning
decisioned to learn 

in the form filled offered in trust
decisioned to learn back

phase decision for learning
for learning by the prospect

a precision for learning
my daughter will learn 

sizes track for asking sound
I learned my location

for my own purposes
