('or', 'let')

into the minority proportion of time
But I can’t let myself treat 

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
I let myself treat

But in more 
If I let myself see others desires

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
But I can’t let myself disregard

off the edge of the world
It’s the third letter from the end

The planning process for visions
I let it remind me again

And for an ungraspable time
