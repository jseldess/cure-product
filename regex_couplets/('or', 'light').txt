('or', 'light')

into the minority proportion of time
variegated reflected light

Before we walk across the wide field
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Before we walk across the wide opening
In the retroactive light

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
In the light of retroactive

before we can have a retroactive
in light of learning what we see

Before anyone buys up the opening
stopped light with validated fields

By my memory elsewhere
where lights blended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
stopped light with validated faces

which I feel formerly about for
