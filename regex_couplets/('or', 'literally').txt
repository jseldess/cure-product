('or', 'literally')

into the minority proportion of time
and literally moved

I have a memory between the day
as it was designed literally

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
and literally unproved

already formely a long time
literally unproved 

for my own purchases
myself moved literally as it is

and for which the plan agreed
I literally moved

which feels most comfortable
and move them literally with me

which feels more comfortable
and literally moved about

The floor slanted in places
literally moved

in the form filled offered in trust
what literally moved

Elsewhere by my memory
not literally moved about

washed by my memory
not literally moved

Aligned or not with my interests
