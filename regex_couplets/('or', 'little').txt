('or', 'little')

into the minority proportion of time
with little reason to move

or argued for them at least
with little reasons to aspiration

The days aligned for company
with little reasons to move

that potential is there for you
There was very little physical activity

tomorrow
aspirating with little visions

off the end of the world
I swayed a little in my state

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
