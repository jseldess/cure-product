('or', 'live')

into the minority proportion of time
I upend live connections to you

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I suspend live connections to you

off the edge of the world
Which is a measure to never live out

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
Which is a pleasure to never live out

But in more 
where I send and relive aside

the impulse for my own prospects
where I stand and retrieve relive

and elsewhere my memory 
where I send and relive would be held

found dated for my own purchases
where I stand and relive

sound inundated for my own purchases
where I send and relive

for my own purchases
where I send and retrieve relive

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
and relive from burrowed travels

But my not feeling the memory aside
where I end and relive

for the duration of answers
where I blend and relive

the opinions in my world
where I stand and retrieve and relive

for the duration of the universe
