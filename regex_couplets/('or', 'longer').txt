('or', 'longer')

into the minority proportion of time
I argued the days felt longer

The planning process is for visionaries only
I argued the days were longer

off the end of the world
I agrued the days were longer

tomorrow
I argued that the days were longer

or argued for them at least
without longer damage

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
