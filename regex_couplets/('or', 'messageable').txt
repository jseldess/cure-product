('or', 'messageable')

into the minority proportion of time
brought messageable to you

off the edge of the world
brought messageable into privacy

for a while to listen 
in privacy that is messageable

for a while not to listen
in that all this in private is messageable

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
All that I own messageable

The prospect for careening attached
