('or', 'middle')

into the minority proportion of time
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
stopping in the middle

before I act on them
stepping in the middle

for a while to listen already
stepping off into the middle

forgettable
stepping off in to the middle

seen having or offering possession
