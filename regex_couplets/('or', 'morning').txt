('or', 'morning')

into the minority proportion of time
We’ll have coffee this morning

off the edge of the world
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

Before we walk across the wide field
When I woke up in the morning

not calling or echoing for once
before morning goals

Tomorrow
Strategy comes before morning

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

It’s morning 
Its strategy comes before morning goals

Strategy comes before goals
