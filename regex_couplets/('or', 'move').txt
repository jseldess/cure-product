('or', 'move')

into the minority proportion of time
since I can imagine movement

or argued for them at least
with little reasons to move

The days aligned for company
with little reason to move

that potential is there for you
with full potential to movement

tomorrow
since you can imagine movement

off the end of the world
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
and literally moved

I have a memory between the day
myself moved literally as it is

and for which the plan agreed
I move

which feels most comfortable
when I move

it can be uncomfortable 
and move them literally with me

which feels more comfortable
and literally moved about

The floor slanted in places
I literally moved

in the form filled offered in trust
literally moved

Elsewhere by my memory
what literally moved

washed by my memory
not literally moved about

after though there’s no memory
also didn’t really move

By my memory elsewhere
not literally moved

Aligned or not with my interests
