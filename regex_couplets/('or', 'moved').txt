('or', 'moved')

into the minority proportion of time
and literally moved

I have a memory between the day
myself moved literally as it is

and for which the plan agreed
I literally moved

which feels most comfortable
and literally moved about

which feels more comfortable
literally moved

The floor slanted in places
what literally moved

in the form filled offered in trust
not literally moved about

washed by my memory
not literally moved

Aligned or not with my interests
