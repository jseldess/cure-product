('or', 'myself')

into the minority proportion of time
So I find myself at home

off the edge of the world
But I can’t let myself treat 

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
I’ll pull myself another personality type

There are performance reviews
I was enjoined to act again myself

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I let myself treat

But in more 
If I let myself see others desires

to be before the sun
I keep turning back again myself

Even before the lesson starts
I’ll pull myself higher up

or an available resource
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

over the long line I would honor
off the end myself

off the end of the world
I was bid to act again myself

tomorrow
I was enjoying acting against myself

or argued for them at least
myself

useless for not having paid
without really binding myself

uses for the attention of the brand
myself moved literally as it is

and for which the plan agreed
the least productive of myself

But my not feeling the memory aside
the least instructive of myself

at least for the duration of the answer
So I found myself at home

for a while to listen already
