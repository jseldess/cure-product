('or', 'need')

into the minority proportion of time
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
and can’t presume to need

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
drifting away needs

There are performance reviews
Then I can’t presume to need others

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I need the work

as far back as my history heard
I need an explicit statement

though as for conversing
which I needed for an explicit state

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
You need history

for an explicit state
And need out in front purchase

For an ungraspable time
where I need gravity

And for an ungraspable time
I tell you where I need gravity

Is the weight of my click or zipcode
not needing to wait

But my not feeling the memory aside
without really needing

which feels more comfortable
in need one in that best own

in the form filled offered in trust
need one in best own

phase decision for learning
that in need one best own

for learning by the prospect
