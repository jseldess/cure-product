('or', 'no')

into the minority proportion of time
Then I cannot see face value

off the edge of the world
On a snow day with my children

Before we walk across the wide field
asynchronous 

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
not calling or echoing for once

Before we walk across the wide opening
who knows the way

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
if not directly on my skin

Before anyone walks across the opening
of not directly from my skin

or the incoming stream
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

for how can I know without direction
That is itself not still

or not even rotating
for how can you know without direction

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
But not to impart cynicism

For whom drifting is not an exception
the drifting is not something special

or currents of air
I’ll pull myself another personality type

There are performance reviews
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

But in more 
Right now I’m the cart

to be before the sun
I am told by no ventillation

over the long line I would honor
out in the snow

or available
Which can be pronounced to the world

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
If he had not carried one virtue

The world 
not one virtue to excess

for not voting for him
which can be pronounced 

in short
nor work in this way daily

nor envy honest work
was not just a defeat

nor envy honestly
In a vertiginous dream

Even before the lesson starts
in a continuous vertiginous dream

hold at intervals riding forward
not back in the results

at intervals while riding forward
there was no promotion

tomorrow
and not falling at all

before morning goals
So that I notice I am the only one

Strategy comes before morning
upsent in the afternoon

The planning process for visions
an upsent afternoon

The planning process is for visionaries only
and strategies not tactics

the planning process for decisions
out in the snow fall

oddly grown over with historic bark
not goals

your bid to the next highest ranked network
in front of the set afternoon

off the end of the world
I take it out in the snow fall

where you can earn more 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

hauling off the end of the world
may not be ingrained

as far back as my history heard
may not be engrained

falling off the end of the world
I even know what I would find

I believe I can prepare for it
will not be the same

falling off the end of the word
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

I need the work
though not many freeze up

though as for conversing
until I could not tire 

the simple act of honoring an accountant
of honoring surmounted

which I needed for an explicit state
The sun high enough to enter directly 

I walk up and don’t work anymore
it was not just a defeat

Toward the start informally given my reasons
until I could not be tired

for to tire as far back as my history
until I could not be hired

for as far back as my history
even when close to my knowing

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

missing words
I used my technology

And for an ungraspable time
that nothing had gravity

full of the missing words
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
and other types of tracking technology

For Mitt Romney
which we can pronounce

But my not feeling the memory aside
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

washed my memory
not speaking

Though we are waiting for her
But my not feeling the memory inside

for my own purchases
from no one point

dawn formerly
not needing to wait

for the duration of answers
knowing the constituents

the opinions in my world
which had on honor to be told

for not paying redundant
for not paying sound overwhelmed

ground for not paying
useless for not having paid

uses for the attention of the brand
when it is not literal

in the form filled offered in trust
and it’s not literal

it can be uncomfortable 
not literally moved about

washed by my memory
after though there’s no memory

in the form filled offered must
It’s not marshal exactly

Though we can’t help waiting for her
It’s not marshall exactly

formerly a way like this one
with no way

Formerly away there are constant ways
with no constant way

By my feeling the memory inside
I end up in Bach with no way 

Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor
But my not 

By my memory elsewhere
Aligned or not with my interests

which I feel formerly about for
I turn not sad exactly

in memory elsewhere

for my own purposes
I return not sad exactly

I returned not sad exactly

for a while not to listen

For a while I think I don’t listen
traffick is there nonetheless

The prospect for careening attached
The sun high enough to strike directly
