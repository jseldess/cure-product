('or', 'only')

into the minority proportion of time
only fragments of time with my children

for how can I know without direction
only in the case

in short
So that I notice I am the only one

Strategy comes before morning
I see only the back of falling values

The planning process for visions
I see only the back

The planning process is for visionaries only
I see only the back of my habits

the planning process for decisions
I can see only the back of falling values

oddly grown over with historic bark
would only willingly break

the opinions in my world
if only on the way to the trash

for a while to listen already
I only think I don’t listen

For a while I think I don’t listen
less only money

The prospect for careening healthily
