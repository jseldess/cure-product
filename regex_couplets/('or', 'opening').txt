('or', 'opening')

into the minority proportion of time
Before we walk across the wide opening

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Before anyone buys up the opening

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
Before anyone walks across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the opening
The simple act opening surmounted

the simple act of honoring an accountant
the simple act of opening surmounted

as far back as my history heard
