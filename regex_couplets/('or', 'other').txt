into the minority proportion of time
I’ll pull myself another personality type

off the edge of the world

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I can’t presume to need others

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
On the other hand

I need the work
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

washed my memory
I presume to others

in the form filled offered in trust
to the other end

Though we are waiting for her
the other end transactions

formerly a way
to the other end of actions

Formerly a way like this one
The other end of means

Formerly away there are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

But my not feeling the memory inside
who know the ways to their other end

By my feeling the memory inside
the other end of actions

to the other end battery dawn 

formerly away
with constant ways to the other end

Forty-one seconds in
to the other end of transactions

on the other end

formerly my way 
Cereal and others’ health

Aligned or not with my interests
I assume possession to others

and maybe forgettable
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
