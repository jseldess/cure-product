('or', 'others')

into the minority proportion of time
others desires

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I can’t presume to need others

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I presume to others

in the form filled offered in trust
Cereal and others’ health

Aligned or not with my interests
I assume possession to others

and maybe forgettable
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
