('or', 'over')

into the minority proportion of time
I step over the edge

or not even rotating
If I step over the edge

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
over the long time up in the sky

There are performance reviews
over the time line I was on

to be before the sun
over the long line up in the sky

over the long line I would honor
hovering above standing water

tomorrow
over the long time I was on

before morning goals
oddly grown over with historic bark

The planning process for visions
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

missing words
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

washed my memory
for not paying sound overwhelmed

ground for not paying
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

seen having or offering possession
