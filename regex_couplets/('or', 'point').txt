('or', 'point')

into the minority proportion of time
But that is beside the point

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Whereas direction is beside the point

off the edge of the world
from no one point

dawn formerly
the point where I am

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
I am requesting my point

But my not feeling the memory aside
 as points which are my interest 

Aligned or not with my interests
I learned my point

for my own purposes
