('or', 'presume')

into the minority proportion of time
So I presume the offers already

off the edge of the world
and can’t presume to need

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I can’t presume to need others

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I continue to presume

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
I presume to others

in the form filled offered in trust
I presume the offers

for a while to listen already
So I presume the offers at home already

for a while to listen 
presume the offers at 

For a while I think I don’t listen
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

and maybe forgettable
