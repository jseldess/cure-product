('or', 'product')

into the minority proportion of time
an impure product

Before we walk across the wide field
What is an impure product

When I woke up in the morning
as a cure product

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
as a pure product

But in more 
as an impure product

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
the least productive of myself

But my not feeling the memory aside
