('or', 'prospect')

into the minority proportion of time
The prospects there already

off the edge of the world
the impulse for my own prospects

the impulse for my own purposes
the impulse my own prospects

But my not feeling the memory aside
stopping into the prospect

in the form filled offered in trust
speech that is of by prospects

phase decision for learning
for learning by the prospect

a precision for learning
step by into the prospect

sizes track for asking sound
decisioned by the prospect

sizes asking for tracking sound
step in by the prospect

for a while to listen already
The prospect for careening attached

The prospect for careening healthily
The prospect for seeing healthily

The prospect for veering healthily
The prospect for steering healthily

forgettable
