('or', 'prospects')

into the minority proportion of time
The prospects there already

off the edge of the world
the impulse for my own prospects

the impulse for my own purposes
the impulse my own prospects

But my not feeling the memory aside
speech that is of by prospects

phase decision for learning
the prospects being seen by me

for a while to listen already
