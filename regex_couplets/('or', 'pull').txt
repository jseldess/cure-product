('or', 'pull')

into the minority proportion of time
I’ll pull myself another personality type

off the edge of the world
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

There are performance reviews
I’ll pull my data higher up

to be before the sun
fish pulled out of the lake

Even before the lesson starts
I’ll pull myself higher up

or an available resource
I’ll pull my data

over the long line I would honor
