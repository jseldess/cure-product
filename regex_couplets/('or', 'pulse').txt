('or', 'pulse')

into the minority proportion of time
impulse control

hold at intervals riding forward
I send and retrieve the impulse

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

the impulse for my own prospects
the impulse for my own purposes

the impulse for my own purchases
the impulse to my purpose

and elsewhere my memory 
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

sound inundated for my own purchases
the impulse my own prospects

impulse for my own purchases
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

for my own purchases
aside the impulse to my purpose

between the drug store and the 
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

But my not feeling the memory inside
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

Though we canâ€™t help waiting for her
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

formerly a way
