('or', 'purchase')

into the minority proportion of time
conversations with our purchase

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
in traversing my purchase

tomorrow
purchased out

missing words
having been purchased out

With a fervor 
having been purchased out of you

storing in surfeit
for an ungraspable purchase

For an ungraspable time
And need out in front purchase

And for an ungraspable time
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I have supporters
until I purchase up the sky

having supporters 
until I purchase the sky

or in some imaginary elsewhere
Is the weight of my purchases

Is the weight of my click or zipcode
I have entered my purchases

But my not feeling the memory aside
the impulse for my own purchases

and elsewhere my memory 
washed my purchases

Though we are waiting for her
for my own purchases

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
found dated for my own purchases

sound inundated for my own purchases
All parties would be held for my own purchases

already formely a long time
impulse for my own purchases

the impulse for my own purposes
converting sight into a purchase

A way formerly like this one
at the site of a purchase

for my own purposes
