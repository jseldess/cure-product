('or', 'purchases')

into the minority proportion of time
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I have supporters
Is the weight of my purchases

Is the weight of my click or zipcode
I have entered my purchases

But my not feeling the memory aside
the impulse for my own purchases

and elsewhere my memory 
washed my purchases

Though we are waiting for her
for my own purchases

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
found dated for my own purchases

sound inundated for my own purchases
All parties would be held for my own purchases

already formely a long time
impulse for my own purchases

the impulse for my own purposes
