('or', 'pure')

into the minority proportion of time
an impure product

Before we walk across the wide field
as pure as my children

I told her a story, she drew waves.
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

When I woke up in the morning
What is an impure product

Before we walk across the wide opening
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
as a pure product

But in more 
as an impure product

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
