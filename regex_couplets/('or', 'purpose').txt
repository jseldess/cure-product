('or', 'purpose')

into the minority proportion of time
by no ventillation my purpose

to be before the sun
until my purpose up in the sky

over the long line I would honor
until I purpose the horizon

the clouds hinged the horizon
of my purpose in versing

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
My purpose up in the sky

For an ungraspable time
Until my purpose 

For an ungraspable purchase
I tell you my purposes

And for an ungraspable time
until I purpose up in the sky

I have supporters
I tell you the weight of my purposes

Is the weight of my click or zipcode
weight of my purposes

missing words 
Where I host my purposes

and elsewhere my memory
I have entered my purposes

and elsewhere my memory of you
the impulse for my own purposes

the impulse for my own purchases
the impulse to my purpose

Elsewhere my memory
entered into my purposes

washed my memory
elsewhere my purposes

Though we are waiting for her
aside the impulse to my purpose

between the drug store and the 
to the other end of my purpose

But my not feeling the memory inside
for my own purposes

aligned or not with my interests
