('or', 'purposes')

into the minority proportion of time
I tell you my purposes

And for an ungraspable time
I tell you the weight of my purposes

Is the weight of my click or zipcode
weight of my purposes

missing words 
Where I host my purposes

and elsewhere my memory
I have entered my purposes

and elsewhere my memory of you
the impulse for my own purposes

the impulse for my own purchases
entered into my purposes

washed my memory
elsewhere my purposes

Though we are waiting for her
for my own purposes

aligned or not with my interests
