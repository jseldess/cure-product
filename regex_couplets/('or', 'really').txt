('or', 'really')

into the minority proportion of time
because it was really dark

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
it was really sunny

not calling or echoing for once
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
When they really take hold of my finger

hold at intervals riding forward
That’s when they really take

at intervals while riding forward
without really agreeing

I have a memory between the day
without really speaking

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
without really breaking

for my own purchases
without really branding 

useless for not having paid
without really binding myself

uses for the attention of the brand
without really binding

which feels most comfortable
without really needing

which feels more comfortable
also didn’t really move

By my memory elsewhere
