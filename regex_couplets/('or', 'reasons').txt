('or', 'reasons')

into the minority proportion of time
reasons resources

Before we walk across the wide field
with reasons

for not voting for him
with little reasons to aspiration

or argued for them at least
with little reasons to move

that potential is there for you
Toward the start informally given my reasons

So I work and donâ€™t look any
More reasons 

You need history
More reasons around my country 

and elsewhere my memory of you
and could be inflected with reasons

before I act on them
