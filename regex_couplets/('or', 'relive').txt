('or', 'relive')

into the minority proportion of time
where I send and relive aside

the impulse for my own prospects
where I stand and retrieve relive

and elsewhere my memory 
where I send and relive would be held

found dated for my own purchases
where I stand and relive

sound inundated for my own purchases
where I send and relive

for my own purchases
where I send and retrieve relive

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
and relive from burrowed travels

But my not feeling the memory aside
where I end and relive

for the duration of answers
where I blend and relive

the opinions in my world
where I stand and retrieve and relive

for the duration of the universe
