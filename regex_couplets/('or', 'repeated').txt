('or', 'repeated')

into the minority proportion of time
I reach repeated expressions first

Before we walk across the wide opening
I propogated repeated expressions first

Before anyone buys up the opening
skin smile repeated expressions

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
burrowed about from repeated travels

But my not feeling the memory aside
deep into pathways from repeated travels

for the duration of answers
