('or', 'results')

into the minority proportion of time
of later results

off the edge of the world
not back in the results

hold at intervals riding forward
Back up through the results

rewind before the sun
back up the results

back up before the results
higher up in the results

before the sunâ€™s deflections
out of later results

to be before the sun
of later pages ruins results

tomorrow
