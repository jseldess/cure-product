('or', 'retrieve')

into the minority proportion of time
I send and retrieve the impulse

But my not feeling the memory aside
I stand and retrieve the impulse

the impulse for my own prospects
where I send and retrieve aside

the impulse for my own purposes
where I stand and retrieve

and elsewhere my memory 
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

sound inundated for my own purchases
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

already formerly a long time
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

for my own purchases
where I stand aside and retrieve

between the drug store and the 
where I send and retrieve relive

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
retrieve 

for the duration of answers
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

But my not feeling the memory inside
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

Though we canâ€™t help waiting for her
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

formerly a way
where I stand and retrieve relive

dawn formerly
where I stand and retrieve and relive

for the duration of the universe
