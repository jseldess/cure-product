('or', 'rewind')

into the minority proportion of time
I was advised to rewind

rewind before the sun
So I was advised to rewind

Back up before the sun
So I was enjoined to rewind

before the sunâ€™s deflections
and came home to rewind inflections

before I act on them
and came home to rewind

Having seen more than I can remember
