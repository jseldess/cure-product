('or', 'rights')

into the minority proportion of time
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

But my not feeling the memory aside
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

drawn formerly rights blended themselves
drawn formerly rights

dawn formerly nights ended themselves
drawn formerly rights ended themselves

shone formerly a long time
where rights ended themselves

drawn formerly along
