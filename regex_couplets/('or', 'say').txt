('or', 'say')

into the minority proportion of time
we had to say goodbye

for an ungraspable purchase
We had to say goodbye there

If articles can storm in excess
And we had to say goodbye to her there

And for an ungraspable time
I ask say in that case

in the form filled offered in trust
we ask say in that case

phase decision for learning
formerly along my say to the elections

formerly my way to the elections
I ask say in that phase decisioned

for learning by the prospect
My say to the elections

Aligned or not with my interests
