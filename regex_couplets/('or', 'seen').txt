('or', 'seen')

into the minority proportion of time
under the last seen principle

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
Having seen more than 

forgetting decisions 
being seen by me

for a while to listen already
Having seen more than I can remember 

forgetting decisions that can be attributable
I have seen more than I can remember

seen having or offering possession
can have seen offering possession

and maybe forgettable
Or can have seen offering possession
