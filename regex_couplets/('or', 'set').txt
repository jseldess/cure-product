('or', 'set')

into the minority proportion of time
upset by Gingrich

The world 
in front of the set afternoon

The planning process is for visionaries only
in front of the set of regulations

oddly grown over with historic bark
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

full of the missing words
Um, upset by Gingrich

nor work in this way daily
presets

own best form
reset

before I act on them
