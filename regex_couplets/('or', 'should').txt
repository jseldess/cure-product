('or', 'should')

into the minority proportion of time
You should ask who I am

off the edge of the world
While I should be sleeping

to be before the sun
Looking back while I should be sleeping

at intervals while riding forward
While I should sleep not back in the results

hold at intervals riding forward
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

I click or my zipcode
One was up where it should be down

And for an ungraspable time
they should rise up

for my own purchases
the constituents should rise up

already formerly a long time
