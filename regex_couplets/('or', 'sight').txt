('or', 'sight')

into the minority proportion of time
In my sight 

tomorrow
in pursuit of the sight

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
converting sight

in the form filled offered in trust
my sight hosting

Elsewhere by my memory
about the sight hosting trusting

by my memory 
converting sight into a purchase

though we are waiting for her
