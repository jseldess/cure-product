('or', 'sky')

into the minority proportion of time
over the long time up in the sky

There are performance reviews
over the long line up in the sky

over the long line I would honor
until my purpose up in the sky

to be before the sun
Blue sky or

One year or
though not many facts up in the sky

as far back as my history heard
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

the simple act of honoring an accountant
Up in the sky

for an ungraspable purchase
My purpose up in the sky

For an ungraspable time
While they’re up in the sky

I have supporters
until I purchase up the sky

having supporters 
While we’re up in the sky

or in some imaginary elsewhere
