('or', 'sleep')

into the minority proportion of time
Where I sleep at times

off the edge of the world
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Before we walk across the wide field
So I went back to sleep

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
That’s where I sleep at times

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
Interrupted sleep or

to be before the sun
While I should be sleeping

Even before the lesson starts
Looking back while I should be sleeping

at intervals while riding forward
While I should sleep not back in the results

hold at intervals riding forward
like flattening sleep 

like state mirror
like sleep

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
