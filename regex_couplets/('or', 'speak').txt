('or', 'speak')

into the minority proportion of time
not speaking

Though we are waiting for her
without really speaking

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly
I speak to them

But my not feeling the memory inside
would only speak willingly

the opinions in my world
I speak to them my possessions

which feels more comfortable
I speak them of my possessions

forgetting decisions 
speak them of my possessions

in the form filled offered in trust
