('or', 'spots')

into the minority proportion of time
white spots on a black surface

tomorrow
but they are black spots

off the end of the world
black spots on a white surface

falling off the end of the world
simple black spots

the simple act of honoring an accountant
all the spots

or in some imaginary elsewhere
