('or', 'stand')

into the minority proportion of time
hovering above standing water

tomorrow
I stand and retrieve the impulse

the impulse for my own prospects
where I stand aside

and elsewhere my memory 
where I stand and relive

sound inundated for my own purchases
I stand and retrieve the impuse

already formerly a long time
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

for my own purchases
where I stand and retrieve

between the drug store and the 
where I stand and retrieve and relive

But my not feeling the memory aside
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

But my not feeling the memory inside
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

Though we canâ€™t help waiting for her
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

formerly a way
where I stand aside and retrieve

dawn formerly
my interfaced stand data

By my memory elsewhere
my standing in data

but for memory elsewhere
by my standing

in memory persisting elsewhere
but standing in memory

shone formerly along time
I learned the point of standing

for my own purposes
