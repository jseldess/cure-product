('or', 'static')

into the minority proportion of time
wrapped in static and explicit statements

though as for conversing
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

the simple act of honoring an accountant
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

as far back as my history heard
You can hear it also through static leisure

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
while wrapped in static

which I needed for an explicit state
while wrapped in explicit static

for to tire as far back as my history
while weâ€™re wrapped in static

for as far back as my history
