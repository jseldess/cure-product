('or', 'stay')

into the minority proportion of time
wrestling to stay still

or not even rotating
So stay with us

that potential is there for you
own stays brought loyal

in the form filled offered in trust
own that stays brought loyal

phase decision for learning
that stays brought loyal

for learning by the prospect
I stay the right of my elections

aligned or not with my interests
stay to my elections

which I feel formerly about for
home stays brought loyal

the people in home form
own stays bought loyal

the people in own form
bought stays own loyal

a precision for learning
