('or', 'step')

into the minority proportion of time
I step off the edge

off the edge of the world
I step over the edge

or not even rotating
If I step over the edge

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
What the next step

The planning process for visions
Whatâ€™s the next step

The planning process is for visionaries only
The next step 

Not goals or tactics
from which to step off

tomorrow
step in by the prospect

phase decision for learning
phase decision step in

for learning by the prospect
step by into the prospect

sizes track for asking sound
stepping in the middle

for a while to listen already
stepping off into the middle

forgettable
stepping off in to the middle

seen having or offering possession
