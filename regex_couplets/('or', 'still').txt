('or', 'still')

into the minority proportion of time
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Before we walk across the wide field
That is itself not still

or not even rotating
I love my daughter still

tomorrow
though we are still breaking in

Though we are waiting for her
still wash conserving

pre-worn and still wash them
so still watch them

Where in me pre-worn
so still them

after though there’s no memory
so still washed

in the form filled offered must
my in-laws still wash conserving

in the form filled offered
