('or', 'stuff')

into the minority proportion of time
between bills and stuffed animals

off the edge of the world
I hear it between bills and stuff

to be before the sun
I can hear it between bills and stuff

off the end of the world
Would I love the same stuff

tomorrow
I can hear them between bills and stuff

falling off the end of the world
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

the simple act of honoring an accountant
bills and stuffed animals

for a while to listen already
