('or', 'talking')

into the minority proportion of time
talking into pheasants bending themselves

tomorrow
talking into percents bending themselves

like state mirror
wearing trying talking into it

I enter the flattening mirror
talking int

without accounting for credit
talking into the cents

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
