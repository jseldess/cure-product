('or', 'tell')

into the minority proportion of time
Then I constellate my time family country

Before we walk across the wide field
So I constellate the time family country

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I constellate the time

for not voting for him
The CEO tells me to embody values

off the edge of the world
I had to tell them the news

tomorrow
I tell you my purposes

And for an ungraspable time
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I have supporters
I tell you the weight of my purposes

Is the weight of my click or zipcode
I tell you where I need gravity

missing words 
and that man comes on to tell me 

in the form filled offered in trust
