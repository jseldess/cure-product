('or', 'their')

into the minority proportion of time
We can wrestle them with their goals

or not even rotating
I am not allowed to see their face

oddly grown over with historic bark
that their economic value 

off the end of the world
without their agreement

which feels more comfortable
to their other end

But my not feeling the memory inside
who know the ways to their other end

By my feeling the memory inside
that their knowing

into an oral
