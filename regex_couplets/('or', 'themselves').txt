('or', 'themselves')

into the minority proportion of time
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Before we walk across the wide opening
talking into pheasants bending themselves

tomorrow
talking into percents bending themselves

like state mirror
walking into percents blending themselves

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

But my not feeling the memory aside
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

drawn formerly a long time
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in memory elsewhere
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

drawn formerly rights blended themselves
dawn formerly nights ended themselves

drawn formerly rights
ended themselves

drawn formerly rights ended themselves
where rights ended themselves

drawn formerly along
