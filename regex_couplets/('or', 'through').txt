('or', 'through')

into the minority proportion of time
You can hear it also through your leisure

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Back up through the results

hold at intervals riding forward
back up through results

rewind before the sun
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I need the work
I cannot clear it also through investiture

though as for conversing
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

the simple act of honoring an accountant
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

as far back as my history heard
You can hear it also through static leisure

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I get through there

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
