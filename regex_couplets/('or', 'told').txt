('or', 'told')

into the minority proportion of time
I told her a story, she drew waves.

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
I am told ventillation

to be before the sun
I am told by no ventillation

over the long line I would honor
I am told by the ventillation

Strategy comes before morning
which ran to be told

the opinions in my world
which had on honor to be told

for not paying redundant
