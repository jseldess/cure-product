('or', 'too')

into the minority proportion of time
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Before we walk across the wide field
too sunny to eat ice cream

not calling or echoing for once
emerging this year from too much standing water

tomorrow
learned without too much difficulty to code

Having transitioned from leisure to work
Selma knows too 

Though we are waiting for her
Selma helps too

Though we can’t help waiting for her
My daughter helps too

But my not feeling the memory inside
