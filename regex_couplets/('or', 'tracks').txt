('or', 'tracks')

into the minority proportion of time
I reuse indelible tracks 

tomorrow
I refuse indelible tracks

I need the work
I resume indelible tracks

though as for conversing
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

as far back as my history heard
in not many tracks up in the sky

the simple act of honoring an accountant
