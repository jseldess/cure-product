('or', 'transactions')

into the minority proportion of time
to the ends of my transactions

I have a memory between the day
The ends of my transactions

But my not feeling the memory inside
To the ends of transactions

though we are waiting for her
the other end transactions

Though we canâ€™t help waiting for her
The other end of transactions like this

By my feeling the memory inside
To the other end of transactions like this

formerly a way
to the other end of transactions
