('or', 'trust')

into the minority proportion of time
I have them trust in me

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
in the form filled offered in trust

Elsewhere by my memory
about the sight hosting trusting

by my memory 
in the form filled offered trust

washed by my memory
Where in me did I lose trust

in the form filled offered
In my heart did I lose trust

though we are waiting for her
