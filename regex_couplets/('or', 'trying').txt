('or', 'trying')

into the minority proportion of time
when trying to feel the extension of key values

oddly grown over with historic bark
that I hear without trying

hauling off the end of the world
wearing trying talking into it

like state mirror
I spun around trying to touch the spots

or in some imaginary elsewhere
