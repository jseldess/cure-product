('or', 'turn')

into the minority proportion of time
in a sharp downward turn 

Before we walk across the wide field
In a sharp downard turn

Before we walk across the wide opening
sudden downward turn

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I keep turning back again myself

off the edge of the world
I keep turning back

hold at intervals riding forward
who knows how to turn it off

Though we are waiting for her
Bach helps turn it off

Though we canâ€™t help waiting for her
My daughter turns it off too

But my not feeling the memory inside
I have turned it off

Formerly a way like this one
I turn not sad exactly

By my memory elsewhere
I return not sad exactly

Aligned or not with my interests
I returned not sad exactly

which I feel formerly about for
to return what I bought

behind or out front or up above
I returned to location

for my own purposes
I returned
