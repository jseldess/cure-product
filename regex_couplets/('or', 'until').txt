('or', 'until')

into the minority proportion of time
until my purpose up in the sky

to be before the sun
until I could not tire 

though as for conversing
until I could not be tired

as far back as my history heard
until I could not be hired

for as far back as my history
until I purpose the horizon

the clouds hinged the horizon
until I purpose up in the sky

I have supporters
until I purchase up the sky

having supporters 
until I purchase the sky

or in some imaginary elsewhere
until the bill came

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
until a happier time found

useless for not having paid
