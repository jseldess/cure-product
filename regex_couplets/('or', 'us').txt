('or', 'us')

into the minority proportion of time
I suspend live connections to you

off the edge of the world
asynchronous 

Before we walk across the wide field
because it was really dark

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

When I woke up in the morning
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Before anyone walks across the opening
They’re just not mine

for how can I know without direction
russling to stay still

or not even rotating
slow asynchronous

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

But in more 
I want to cite a poem so usual

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
was not just a defeat

nor envy honestly
In a vertiginous dream

to be before the sun
in a continuous vertiginous dream

Even before the lesson starts
In a continuous theme

hold at intervals riding forward
Remnant continuous pages

at intervals while riding forward
The ventillation rushes on

Strategy comes before morning
I just got a letter

The planning process for visions
So stay with us

that potential is there for you
but it continued rippling muscle

tomorrow
I reuse unassimilable visions

off the end of the world
because there was no solid ground to continue along

hauling off the end of the world
I reuse indelible tracks

falling off the end of the world
I refuse indelible tracts

I need the work
it was not just a defeat

Toward the start informally given my reasons
I have them trust in me

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
Articles all around us

storing in surfeit
I wear suspenders

And for an ungraspable time
I used my technology

I have supporters
suspenders

or in some imaginary elsewhere
a futile joyous white sun

full of the missing words
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
in the form filled offered in trust

Elsewhere by my memory
trackers collecting data on users

washed my memory
The trackers on users

More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

Though we are waiting for her
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

already formerly a long time
useless for not having paid

uses for the attention of the brand
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

washed by my memory
about the sight hosting trusting

by my memory 
in the form filled offered trust

pre-worn in me
in the form filled offered must

pre-worn and still wash them
Where in me did I lose trust

in the form filled offered
In my heart did I lose trust

dawn already formerly nights 
radiating from housing

but for memory elsewhere
