('or', 'value')

into the minority proportion of time
Then I cannot see face value

off the edge of the world
value falling off the edge of the face

Before we walk across the wide opening
And as an extension of the values

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
The value falling off the edge of the face

to be before the sun
The CEO tells me to embody values

Even before the lesson starts
The value falling off the edge of th face

over the long line I would honor
I see only the back of falling values

The planning process for visions
of my economic value

The planning process is for visionaries only
of the economic value my habits

the planning process for decisions
I see the back of falling values

oddly grown over with historic bark
and key value

off the end of the world
As an extension of the values

that potential is there for you
