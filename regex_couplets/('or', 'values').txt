('or', 'values')

into the minority proportion of time
And as an extension of the values

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
The CEO tells me to embody values

off the edge of the world
I see only the back of falling values

The planning process for visions
I see the back of falling values

The planning process is for visionaries only
I can see only the back of falling values

oddly grown over with historic bark
I tried to feel the key values extending 

off the end of the world
As an extension of the values

that potential is there for you
