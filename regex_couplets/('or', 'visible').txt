('or', 'visible')

into the minority proportion of time
I assumed it was visible

off the edge of the world
Iâ€™ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

There are performance reviews
And make myself a visible

to be before the sun
Divisible or

Attributable or
I assume the offers divisible

before I act on them
that they were divisible

Having seen more than I can remember 
I assumed that they were divisible

seen having or offering possession
