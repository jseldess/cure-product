('or', 'vision')

into the minority proportion of time
I had me a vision

tomorrow
The planning process for visions

The planning process is for visionaries only
aspirating visions

off the end of the world
aspirating with visions

or argued for them at least
embodied with little visions

The days aligned for company
little visions

that potential is there for you
aspirating with little visions

where you can earn more 
there wasn’t any television 

hauling off the end of the world
I resume unassimilable visions

as far back as my history heard
The long time I had a vision

I need the work
up in the television pleasure

though as for conversing
up in the television

the simple act of honoring an accountant
I resume attributable visions

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
The long time I was a vision

for as far back as my history
I had a vision

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
attributable visions

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

full of the missing words
joined in my television

By my memory elsewhere
visions that can be attainable

for a while to listen already
revisions that can be attributable

For a while I think I don’t listen
