('or', 'visions')

into the minority proportion of time
The planning process for visions

The planning process is for visionaries only
aspirating visions

off the end of the world
aspirating with visions

tomorrow
embodied with little visions

or argued for them at least
little visions

that potential is there for you
aspirating with little visions

where you can earn more 
I resume unassimilable visions

hauling off the end of the world
I resume attributable visions

as far back as my history heard
attributable visions

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
visions that can be attainable

for a while to listen already
revisions that can be attributable

For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
