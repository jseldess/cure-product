('or', 'want')

into the minority proportion of time
When I want something

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
I want to find a way to block it incoming

Before anyone buys up the opening
I want to find a way to block it

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them

Before anyone has walked across the field
I want but not to impart cynicism

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
I want to cite a poem so usual

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I want to cite a poem

in short
all that I can think I want

off the end of the world
