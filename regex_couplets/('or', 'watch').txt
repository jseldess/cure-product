('or', 'watch')

into the minority proportion of time
when watching tv

off the end of the world
in the sense of watching

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
I watch a movie

missing words
I watch a moving afterimage

With a fervor 
When I'm watching my tv 

in the form filled offered in trust
so still watch them

Where in me pre-worn
where Iâ€™m watching my tv

for the duration of the universe
