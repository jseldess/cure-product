('or', 'ways')

into the minority proportion of time
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

Before we walk across the wide field
always watching

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
deep into pathways from repeated travels

But my not feeling the memory aside
with constant ways 

Though we are waiting for her
with her ways to the ends

But my not feeling the memory inside
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

formerly a way
There are constant ways

Formerly a way like this one
Formerly away there are constant ways

By my feeling the memory inside
with constant ways to the other end

Forty-one seconds in
