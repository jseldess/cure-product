('or', 'We')

into the minority proportion of time
We’ll have coffee this morning

off the edge of the world
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Before we walk across the wide field
We can wrestle them with their goals

or not even rotating
We had to say goodbye there

If articles can storm in excess
We had to buy there

For an ungraspable time
We had inhabited actually

in the form filled offered in trust
We got paid one way by a voice

nor work in this way daily
We ask say in that case

own best form
