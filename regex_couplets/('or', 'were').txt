('or', 'were')

into the minority proportion of time
When we had jobs that were to earn

for not voting for him
my desires were open

off the edge of the world
I wish my desires were open

to be before the sun
I argued the days were longer

off the end of the world
I agrued the days were longer

tomorrow
The days were long

or argued for them at least
I argued that the days were longer

The days aligned for company
The days were long aligned

that potential is there for you
they were on

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

full of the missing words
formerly a long time they were on

I have a memory between the day
answered about 

But my not feeling the memory aside
by the sight of the hosting answered about

by my memory 
I answered about

By my memory elsewhere
washed I answered about

washed by my memory
formerly along time they were on

Having seen more than 
I answered what I thought

shone formerly a long time
time they were on

drawn formerly a long time
in the long time they were on

but for memory elsewhere
They were filters

addition were filters formerly
I answered what I thought about

but standing in memory
formerly along the time they were on

Aligned or not with my interests
that they were visible

before I act on them
that they were divisible

Having seen more than I can remember 
I assumed that they were divisible

seen having or offering possession
