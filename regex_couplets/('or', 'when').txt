('or', 'When')

into the minority proportion of time
When I woke up in the morning

not calling or echoing for once
When I want something

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
When we had jobs that were to earn

for not voting for him
When they really take hold of my finger

hold at intervals riding forward
When closed to my knowing

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
When I'm watching my tv 

in the form filled offered in trust
