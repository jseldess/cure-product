('or', 'white')

into the minority proportion of time
white spots on a black surface

tomorrow
black spots on a white surface

off the end of the world
a futile joyous white sun

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
