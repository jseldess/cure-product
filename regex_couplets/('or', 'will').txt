('or', 'will')

into the minority proportion of time
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

for how can I know without direction
will not be the same

falling off the end of the world
that will spur me on

Black for the pines, black for the cypresses
would only willingly break

the opinions in my world
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

in the form filled offered in trust
my daughter will learn 

sizes track for asking sound
