('or', 'world')

into the minority proportion of time
off the edge of the world

Before we walk across the wide field
Which can be pronounced to the world

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
The world 

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
off the end of the world

The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
hauling off the end of the world

Tomorrow
falling off the end of the world

I believe I can prepare for it
the opinions in my world

which had on honor to be told
