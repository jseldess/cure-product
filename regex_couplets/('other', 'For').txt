('other', 'For')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I can’t presume to need others
Forecasting the story before dawn

On the other hand
For an ungraspable time

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
For Mitt Romney

and other types of tracking technology
For my own purchases

I presume to others
Formerly a way like this one

to the other end
Formerly away there are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

the other end of actions
Forty-one seconds in

to the other end of actions
For a while I think I don’t listen

I assume possession to others
