('other', 'It')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

others desires
It has been since

Then I can’t presume to need others
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

On the other hand
It’s not marshal exactly

the other end transactions
It’s not marshall exactly

to the other end
