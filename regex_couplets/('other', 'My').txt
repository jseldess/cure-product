('other', 'My')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
My associations

On the other hand
My purpose up in the sky

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
My daughter with her way

to the other end
My daughter helps too

the other end transactions
My say to the elections

Cereal and others’ health
My interesting politics

I presume to others
