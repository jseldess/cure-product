('other', 'Or')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
Or the company

On the other hand
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Or alter of course the time anyway

and other types of tracking technology
Or can have seen offering possession

I presume to others
