('other', 'That')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
That’s exaclty what I want for them

others desires
That’s where I sleep at times

On the other hand
That I captured an afterimage

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
That are my right to say

Cereal and others’ health
