('other', 'There')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

others desires
There are quarterly goals

Then I can’t presume to need others
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

On the other hand
There are spots waiting

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
There are constant ways

The other end of means
There are no constant waves

The other ends of my transactions
There are no constant ways

The other end of my transactions
