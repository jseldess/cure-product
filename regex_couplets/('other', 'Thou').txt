('other', 'Thou')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Though there are quarters goals

others desires
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

On the other hand
Though in not many acts

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Though we are waiting for her

and other types of tracking technology
Though we are breaking 

I presume to others
Though we can’t help waiting

to the other end
