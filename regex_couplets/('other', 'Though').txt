('other', 'though')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
As though stationary and a destination

others desires
though it was most emphatically that

On the other hand
though not many freeze up

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I thought

and other types of tracking technology
though we are still breaking in

I presume to others
after though there’s no memory

to the other end
I answered what I thought

Cereal and others’ health
