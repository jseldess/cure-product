('other', 'To')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
To my children Walt Whitman

others desires
To my chidren

Then I can’t presume to need others
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

On the other hand
Toward the start informally given my reasons

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
To neither study

and other types of tracking technology
To the ends of transactions

I presume to others
To the ends of my transactions

to the other end
To the other end of transactions

To the other end of my actions
To the other end of transactions like this

the other end of actions
To the other end of means like this one

Like this one the other end of means
To the right of determined elections

I assume possession to others
