('other', 'what')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i

others desires
I invited most of what came next

On the other hand
what literally moved

I presume to others
I answered what I thought

Cereal and others’ health
to return what I bought

I assume possession to others
