('other', 'Where')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
Where official policy is to catch and release

On the other hand
Where I lead gravity

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Where in me did I host

and other types of tracking technology
Where I host my purposes

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
Where in me did I last

I presume to others
Where in me did I lose

to the other end
