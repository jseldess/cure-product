('other', 'Which')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
Which is a measure to never live out

others desires
Which can be pronounced to the world

On the other hand
Which is a pleasure to never live out

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Which can be called confidence

and other types of tracking technology
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

I presume to others
