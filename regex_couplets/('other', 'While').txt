('other', 'while')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Looking back while I should be sleeping

On the other hand
while wrapped in static

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
while consuming damage

and other types of tracking technology
I answered while interfaced

Cereal and others’ health
for a while to listen already

I presume to others
