('other', 'You')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
You can hear it also through your leisure

others desires
You use the most essential parts

On the other hand
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
You can have seen offering

I assume possession to others
