('other', 'across')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Before we walk across the wide field

others desires
across the retinas

On the other hand
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

I assume possession to others
