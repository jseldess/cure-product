('other', 'act')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

others desires
I was enjoined to act again myself

Then I can’t presume to need others
I was enjoined to act again

On the other hand
though not many facts up in the sky

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
we had inhabited actually

and other types of tracking technology
The ends of my transactions

I presume to others
to the ends of my transactions

to the other end
It’s not marshal exactly

the other end transactions
to the other end of actions

to the other end battery dawn 
It’s not marshall exactly

The other end of means
The other end of transactions like this

to their other end
The other ends of my transactions

The other end of my transactions
To the other end of transactions

To the other end of my actions
To the other end of transactions like this

the other end of actions
Like this one other end of transactions

To the other end of means like this one
actions

with constant ways to the other end
of my actions

on the other end
I turn not sad exactly

Cereal and others’ health
I return not sad exactly

I assume possession to others
