('other', 'also')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
You can hear it also through your leisure

others desires
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

On the other hand
I cannot clear it also through investiture

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
also didn’t really move

Cereal and others’ health
