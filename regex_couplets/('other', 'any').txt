('other', 'any')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

others desires
at any time it can drift again

Then I can’t presume to need others
Or the company

On the other hand
though not many freeze up

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

and other types of tracking technology
They have very many choices

I presume to others
if there is anything 

to the other end
The many transparent pixel calls

who know the way to their other end
The many transparent pixels call

The other ends of my transactions
or imagined anyway

I assume possession to others
