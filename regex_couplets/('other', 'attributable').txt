('other', 'attributable')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
I resume attributable visions

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
that decisions can be attributable

to the other end
decisions that can be attributable

I presume to others
in that decisions can be attributable

I assume possession to others
