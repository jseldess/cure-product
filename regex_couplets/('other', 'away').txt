('other', 'away')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
drifting away

others desires
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
drifting away needs

If I let myself see others desires
drifting away from the task

On the other hand
Who throws contours away

to the other end
Formerly away there are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
formerly away

with constant ways to the other end
