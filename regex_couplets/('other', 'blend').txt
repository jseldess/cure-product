('other', 'blend')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
battery dawn nights blending themselves

others desires
walking into percents blending themselves

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
where I blend and relive

I presume to others
where lights blended themselves

Cereal and others’ health
