('other', 'call')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
not calling or echoing for once

others desires
though it was most emphatically that

On the other hand
Which can be called confidence

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
to take the call

I presume to others
The many transparent pixel calls

who know the way to their other end
The many transparent pixels call

to the other end
of the many transparent pixel calls

The other ends of my transactions
recalling aside

Cereal and others’ health
