('other', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I can’t fix them without direction

others desires
and can’t presume to need

Then I can’t presume to need others
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
But I can’t let myself treat 

If I let myself see others desires
But I can’t let myself disregard

On the other hand
Though we can’t help waiting

to the other end
I can’t remember them

I presume to others
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

I assume possession to others
