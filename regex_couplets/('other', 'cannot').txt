('other', 'cannot')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
Then I cannot see face value

others desires
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

On the other hand
I cannot clear it also through investiture

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
in that I cannot remember 

I presume to others
