('other', 'children')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
On a snow day with my children

others desires
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Then I can’t presume to need others
To my children Walt Whitman

If I let myself see others desires
Even the children

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
my possession of my children

I presume to others
speech my possession of my children

to the other end
