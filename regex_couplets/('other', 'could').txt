('other', 'could')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
and could be mapped and weighed

On the other hand
until I could not tire 

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I could consume the dream

and other types of tracking technology
and could be inflected with reasons

I presume to others
