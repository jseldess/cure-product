('other', 'daughter')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I love my daughter still

On the other hand
with my daughter

I presume to others
my daughter will learn 

to the other end
My daughter helps too

the other end transactions
my daughter’s squirrel and chickadee joined me

Cereal and others’ health
