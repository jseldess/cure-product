('other', 'dawn')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
battery dawn nights blending themselves

others desires
Forecasting the story before dawn

On the other hand
dawn already formerly nights 

and other types of tracking technology
dawn formerly

I presume to others
battery dawn nights 

to the other end of actions
to the other end battery dawn 

the other end transactions
battery dawn 

to the other end
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

to their other end
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

Cereal and others’ health
