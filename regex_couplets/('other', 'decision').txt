('other', 'decision')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
the planning process for decisions

On the other hand
attributable decisions

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
forgetting decisions 

I presume to others
decisioned to learn 

to the other end
decisioned to learn back

Cereal and others’ health
decisions that can be attributable

I assume possession to others
