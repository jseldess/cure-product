('other', 'decisions')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
the planning process for decisions

On the other hand
attributable decisions

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
forgetting decisions 

I presume to others
that decisions can be attributable

to the other end
decisions that can be attributable

I assume possession to others
