('other', 'directly')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
if not directly on my skin

others desires
But not to me directly

On the other hand
The sun high enough to enter directly 

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
The sun high enough to strike directly

I assume possession to others
