('other', 'do')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
in a sharp downward turn 

others desires
does not feel an exception

Then I can’t presume to need others
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

If I let myself see others desires
to the down arrow

On the other hand
What I do in my liesure

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
here is the site of the battle of maldon

and other types of tracking technology
and it doesn’t take long

I presume to others
latency which doesn’t mean anything

to the other end
I only think I don’t listen

I assume possession to others
