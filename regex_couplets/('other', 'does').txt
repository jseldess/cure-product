('other', 'does')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

others desires
does not feel an exception

Then I can’t presume to need others
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

If I let myself see others desires
and it doesn’t take long

I presume to others
latency which doesn’t mean anything

to the other end
