('other', 'eat')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
too sunny to eat ice cream

others desires
But I can’t let myself treat 

Then I can’t presume to need others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

If I let myself see others desires
I let myself treat

On the other hand
it was not just a defeat

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
And from that great distance

and other types of tracking technology
was not just a defeat

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
for the creation of the universe

I presume to others
burrowed about from repeated travels

Cereal and others’ health
