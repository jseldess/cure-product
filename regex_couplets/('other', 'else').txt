('other', 'else')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
If you have confidence regardless all else

On the other hand
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
and elsewhere my memory

and other types of tracking technology
and elsewhere my memory of you

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
elsewhere my purposes

I presume to others
elsewhere by my memory

to the other end
By my memory elsewhere

Cereal and others’ health
