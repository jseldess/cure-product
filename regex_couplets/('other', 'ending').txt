('other', 'ending')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
battery dawn nights blending themselves

others desires
I tried to feel the key values extending 

On the other hand
talking into pheasants bending themselves

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

I presume to others
battery dawn nights ending themselves

Cereal and others’ health
