('other', 'feeling')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
conversations with our feelings

others desires
But my not feeling the memory aside

and other types of tracking technology
But my not feeling the memory inside

I presume to others
By my feeling the memory inside

the other end of actions
But my feeling the memory aside

Cereal and others’ health
