('other', 'form')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
There are performance reviews

Then I can’t presume to need others
Toward the start informally given my reasons

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
already formerly a long time

and other types of tracking technology
A way formerly like this one

I presume to others
in the form filled offered in trust

to the other end
formerly a way

to the other end of actions
formerly a way like this one

The other end of means
formerly away

with constant ways to the other end
formerly my way 

Cereal and others’ health
which I feel formerly about for

I assume possession to others
