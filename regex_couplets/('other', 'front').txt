('other', 'front')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

others desires
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

On the other hand
And need out in front purchase

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
behind or out front or up above

I presume to others
