('other', 'get')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I’ll get there eventually

others desires
and is relentlessly budgeted

Then I can’t presume to need others
I’ll get there ruins

On the other hand
I get through there

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
forgetting decisions 

I presume to others
forgettable

I assume possession to others
and maybe forgettable

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
