('other', 'Having')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
Having transitioned from leisure to work

On the other hand
Having been purchased out of you

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Having seen more than 

I presume to others
Having seen more than I can remember 

I assume possession to others
