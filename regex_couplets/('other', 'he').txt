('other', 'he')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
off the edge of the world

others desires
The dogs and lillies

Then I can’t presume to need others
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
In the right sense

On the other hand
I need the work

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

washed my memory

I presume to others
speak them of my possessions

to the other end
the other end transactions

to the other end of actions
to the other end battery dawn 

The other end of means
The way that I was going

The other end of transactions like this
who knows the way

to their other end
the contours exchange with you

to their other contours
who know the ways to their other end

who know the way to their other end
The many transparent pixels call

The other ends of my transactions
There are no constant ways

The other end of my transactions
To the other end of transactions

To the other end of my actions
To the other end of transactions like this

the other end of actions
There are constant ways

Like this one other end of transactions
To the other end of means like this one

Like this one the other end of means
But my not feeling the memory inside

with constant ways to the other end
to the other end of my purpose

on the other end
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

Cereal and others’ health
wealth and the pace of digestion

I assume possession to others
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
