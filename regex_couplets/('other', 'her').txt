('other', 'her')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I’ll get there eventually

others desires
Then I can’t presume to need others

If I let myself see others desires
where I sleep at times

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
There are quarterly goals

On the other hand
there was no television to hear

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
here is the site of the battle of maldon

elsewhere my purposes

I presume to others
Where in me did I host

to the other end
the other end transactions

to the other end of actions
to the other end battery dawn 

The other end of means
Formerly away there are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
to their other end

to their other contours
who know the ways to their other end

who know the way to their other end
There are no constant waves

The other ends of my transactions
There are no constant ways

The other end of my transactions
To the other end of transactions

To the other end of my actions
To the other end of transactions like this

the other end of actions
There are constant ways

Like this one other end of transactions
To the other end of means like this one

Like this one the other end of means
with constant ways to the other end

to the other end of my purpose
on the other end

Cereal and others’ health
my ethereal economic relations

I assume possession to others
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
