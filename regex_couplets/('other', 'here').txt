('other', 'here')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I’ll get there eventually

others desires
where I sleep at times

drifting away needs others presume desires
There are quarterly goals

Then I can’t presume to need others
That’s where I sleep at times

On the other hand
there was no television to hear

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
here is the site of the battle of maldon

and other types of tracking technology
and elsewhere my memory of you

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
elsewhere my purposes

I presume to others
Where in me did I host

to the other end
Is there a baby and a bear

the other end transactions
There are constant ways

The other end of means
Formerly away there are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
There are no constant waves

The other ends of my transactions
There are no constant ways

The other end of my transactions
where rights ended themselves

Cereal and others’ health
my ethereal economic relations

I assume possession to others
