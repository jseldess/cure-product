('other', 'if')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
drifting away

others desires
drifting does not feel an exception

Then I can’t presume to need others
drifting away needs others presume desires

If I let myself see others desires
at any time it can drift again

Then I can’t presume to feed others
drifting away from the task

On the other hand
If I take a different measure

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
if there is anything 

and other types of tracking technology
if you have providence

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
if that has anything

I presume to others
if only on the way to the trash

I assume possession to others
