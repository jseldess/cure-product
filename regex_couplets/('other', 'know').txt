('other', 'know')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
who knows the way

others desires
I even know what I would find

On the other hand
even when close to my knowing

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
knowing the constituents

I presume to others
who knows how to turn it off

to the other end
who know the ways to their other end

who know the way to their other end
that their knowing

I assume possession to others
