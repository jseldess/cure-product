('other', 'learn')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
in light of learning what we see

others desires
I spend time online learning to code

On the other hand
decisioned to learn 

I presume to others
decisioned to learn back

to the other end
phase decision for learning

Cereal and others’ health
I learned my location

I assume possession to others
