('other', 'let')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
But I can’t let myself treat 

others desires
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
I let myself treat

Then I can’t presume to need others
But I can’t let myself disregard

On the other hand
I let it remind me again

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
