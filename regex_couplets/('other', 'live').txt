('other', 'live')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Which is a measure to never live out

others desires
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

On the other hand
Which is a pleasure to never live out

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
where I send and relive aside

and other types of tracking technology
where I send and relive would be held

I presume to others
where I send and relive

Cereal and others’ health
