('other', 'man')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

others desires
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Then I can’t presume to need others
To my children Walt Whitman

If I let myself see others desires
not many face up

On the other hand
though not many freeze up

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

and other types of tracking technology
They have very many choices

I presume to others
and that man comes on to tell me 

to the other end
The many transparent pixel calls

who know the way to their other end
The many transparent pixels call

The other ends of my transactions
