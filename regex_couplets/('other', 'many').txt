('other', 'many')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
not many face up

On the other hand
though not many freeze up

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
They have very many choices

I presume to others
The many transparent pixel calls

who know the way to their other end
The many transparent pixels call

to the other end
of the many transparent pixel calls

The other ends of my transactions
