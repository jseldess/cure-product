('other', 'mean')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
What does it mean to drift

Then I can’t presume to need others
My means without gravity

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
latency which doesn’t mean anything

I presume to others
The other end of means

The other end of transactions like this
To the other end of means like this one

Like this one the other end of means
