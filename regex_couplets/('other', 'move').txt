('other', 'move')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
since I can imagine movement

On the other hand
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
and literally moved

and other types of tracking technology
myself moved literally as it is

I presume to others
and literally moved about

to the other end
not literally moved about

Cereal and others’ health
not literally moved

I assume possession to others
