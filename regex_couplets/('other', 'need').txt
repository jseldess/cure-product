('other', 'need')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

others desires
and can’t presume to need

Then I can’t presume to need others
drifting away needs others presume desires

If I let myself see others desires
drifting away needs

Then I can’t presume to feed others
I need the work

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
And need out in front purchase

and other types of tracking technology
not needing to wait

I presume to others
in need one in that best own

to the other end
need one in best own

Cereal and others’ health
that in need one best own

I assume possession to others
