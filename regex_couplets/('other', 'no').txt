('other', 'no')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
On a snow day with my children

others desires
does not feel an exception

Then I can’t presume to need others
But not to impart cynicism

If I let myself see others desires
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

On the other hand
though not many freeze up

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I used my technology

and other types of tracking technology
was not just a defeat

not speaking

I presume to others
and it’s not literal

to the other end
It’s not marshal exactly

the other end transactions
who knows how to turn it off

to the other end of actions
It’s not marshall exactly

The other end of means
who knows the way

to their other end
with no constant ways 

who know the ways to their other end
But my not feeling the memory inside

who know the way to their other end
with no constant waves

The other ends of my transactions
There are no constant ways

The other end of my transactions
with no way

the other end of actions
I end up in Bach with no way 

to the other end of transactions
and have no way

on the other end
not literally moved about

Cereal and others’ health
between cereal and economic

I assume possession to others
in that I cannot remember 

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
