('other', 'now')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
On a snow day with my children

others desires
Right now I’m the cart

Then I can’t presume to need others
out in the snow

On the other hand
even when close to my knowing

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
knowing the constituents

I presume to others
who knows the way

to the other end
who knows how to turn it off

the other end transactions
who know the ways to their other end

who know the way to their other end
that their knowing

I assume possession to others
