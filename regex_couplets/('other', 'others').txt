('other', 'others')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
others desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
I presume to others

to the other end
Cereal and others’ health

I assume possession to others
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
