('other', 'over')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I step over the edge

others desires
over the long time up in the sky

Then I can’t presume to need others
over the time line I was on

On the other hand
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

I presume to others
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

I assume possession to others
