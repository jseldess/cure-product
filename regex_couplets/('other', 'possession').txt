('other', 'possession')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I speak to them my possessions

I presume to others
speak them of my possessions

to the other end
my possession of my children

Cereal and others’ health
I stay the right of my possessions 

I assume possession to others
Or can have seen offering possession

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
