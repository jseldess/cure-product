('other', 'prospect')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
the impulse for my own prospects

and other types of tracking technology
the impulse my own prospects

I presume to others
stopping into the prospect

to the other end
speech that is of by prospects

Cereal and others’ health
The prospects there already

I assume possession to others
