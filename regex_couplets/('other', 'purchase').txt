('other', 'purchase')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
conversations with our purchase

others desires
in traversing my purchase

On the other hand
purchased out

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I have entered my purchases

and other types of tracking technology
washed my purchases

I presume to others
converting sight into a purchase

to the other end
for my own purchases

Cereal and others’ health
at the site of a purchase

I assume possession to others
