('other', 'purchases')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I tell you the weight of my purchases

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I have entered my purchases

and other types of tracking technology
washed my purchases

I presume to others
for my own purchases

Cereal and others’ health
