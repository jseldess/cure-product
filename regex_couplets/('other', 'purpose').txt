('other', 'purpose')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
by no ventillation my purpose

On the other hand
until I purpose the horizon

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
My purpose up in the sky

and other types of tracking technology
I have entered my purposes

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
elsewhere my purposes

I presume to others
to the other end of my purpose

to the other end of transactions
the impulse for my own purposes

Cereal and others’ health
for my own purposes

I assume possession to others
