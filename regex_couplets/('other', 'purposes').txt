('other', 'purposes')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I tell you my purposes

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Where I host my purposes

and other types of tracking technology
I have entered my purposes

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
elsewhere my purposes

I presume to others
the impulse for my own purposes

Cereal and others’ health
for my own purposes

I assume possession to others
