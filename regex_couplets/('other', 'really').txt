('other', 'really')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
because it was really dark

others desires
When they really take hold of my finger

On the other hand
without really agreeing

and other types of tracking technology
without really speaking

I presume to others
without really needing

to the other end
also didn’t really move

Cereal and others’ health
