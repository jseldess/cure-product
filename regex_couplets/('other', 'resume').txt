('other', 'resume')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
and can’t presume to need

others desires
Then I can’t presume to need others

If I let myself see others desires
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to feed others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

On the other hand
I resume unassimilable visions

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I presume to others

to the other end
So I presume the offers already

I assume possession to others
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
