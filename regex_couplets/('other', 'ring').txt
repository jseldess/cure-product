('other', 'ring')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
interferring 

others desires
bring your child along

Then I can’t presume to need others
ring

On the other hand
the simple act of honoring an accountant

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
storing in surfeit

and other types of tracking technology
firing and connecting somewhere

I presume to others
The prospect for veering healthily

I assume possession to others
in school and can see offering

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
Or can have seen offering possession
