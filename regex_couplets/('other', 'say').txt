('other', 'say')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
we had to say goodbye

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I ask say in that case

I presume to others
we ask say in that case

to the other end
formerly along my say to the elections

Cereal and others’ health
I ask say in that phase decisioned

I assume possession to others
