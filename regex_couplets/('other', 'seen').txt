('other', 'seen')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
under the last seen principle

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Having seen more than 

I presume to others
being seen by me

I assume possession to others
Or can have seen offering possession

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
