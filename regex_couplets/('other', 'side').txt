('other', 'side')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

others desires
aside from the retinas

On the other hand
But my not feeling the memory aside

and other types of tracking technology
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

I presume to others
by the side of the hosting service

to the other end
But my not feeling the memory inside

the other end transactions
By my feeling the memory inside

the other end of actions
44 seconds inside

on the other end
where I send and relive aside

Cereal and others’ health
