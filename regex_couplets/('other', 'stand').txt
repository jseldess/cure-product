('other', 'stand')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
hovering above standing water

On the other hand
I stand and retrieve the impulse

and other types of tracking technology
where I stand and relive

I presume to others
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

to the other end
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

the other end transactions
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

The other end of means
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

Cereal and others’ health
I learned the point of standing

I assume possession to others
