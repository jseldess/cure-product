('other', 'stay')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
wrestling to stay still

others desires
So stay with us

On the other hand
own stays brought loyal

I presume to others
own that stays brought loyal

to the other end
that stays brought loyal

Cereal and others’ health
I stay the right of my elections

I assume possession to others
