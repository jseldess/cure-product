('other', 'step')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I step off the edge

others desires
What the next step

On the other hand
step in by the prospect

to the other end
phase decision step in

Cereal and others’ health
step by into the prospect

I presume to others
stepping off into the middle

I assume possession to others
