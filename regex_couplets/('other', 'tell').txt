('other', 'tell')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
Then I constellate my time family country

others desires
So I constellate the time family country

On the other hand
I tell you my purposes

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
and that man comes on to tell me 

I presume to others
