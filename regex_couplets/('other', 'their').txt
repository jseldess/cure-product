('other', 'their')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
We can wrestle them with their goals

others desires
I am not allowed to see their face

On the other hand
without their agreement

I presume to others
to their other end

to their other contours
who know the ways to their other end

who know the way to their other end
that their knowing

I assume possession to others
