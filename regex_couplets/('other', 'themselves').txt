('other', 'themselves')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
battery dawn nights blending themselves

others desires
talking into pheasants bending themselves

On the other hand
talking into percents bending themselves

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

I presume to others
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

Cereal and others’ health
