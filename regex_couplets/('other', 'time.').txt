('other', 'time.')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Then I constellate my time family country

others desires
where I sleep at times

drifting away needs others presume desires
at any time it can drift again

Then I can’t presume to need others
That’s where I sleep at times

On the other hand
The long time I had a vision

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
or alter of course the time anyway

and other types of tracking technology
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

I presume to others
formerly a long time they were on

to the other end
formerly along time they were on

Cereal and others’ health
in the long time they were on

I assume possession to others
