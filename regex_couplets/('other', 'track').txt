('other', 'track')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I reuse indelible tracks 

On the other hand
I resume indelible tracks

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
and other types of tracking technology

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
The trackers on users

I presume to others
which as tracked befitted 

to the other end
which as tracked befitted phased

Cereal and others’ health
sizes track for asking sound

I assume possession to others
