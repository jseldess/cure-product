('other', 'until')

Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type
until my purpose up in the sky

On the other hand
until I could not tire 

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
until I purpose up in the sky

and other types of tracking technology
until a happier time found

I presume to others
