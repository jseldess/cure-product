('other', 'up?')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I’ll get there eventually

others desires
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Then I can’t presume to need others
as an impure product

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
as a pure product

If I let myself see others desires
But I can’t let myself treat 

On the other hand
though not many freeze up

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
black spots on a white surface

I thought

I presume to others
own stays brought loyal

to the other end
I end up Bach

the other end transactions
I end up in Bach

to the other end of actions
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

The other end of means
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

to their other end
the contours exchange with you

to their other contours
But my not feeling the memory inside

who know the ways to their other end
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

The other ends of my transactions
and end up in Bach

To the other end of my actions
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

the other end of actions
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

to the other end battery dawn 
I end up Bach forty-one seconds in

with constant ways to the other end
to the other end of my purpose

to the other end of transactions
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

on the other end
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

Cereal and others’ health
about 

I assume possession to others
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
