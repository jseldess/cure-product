('other', 'us')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
asynchronous 

others desires
slow asynchronous

Then I can’t presume to need others
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

If I let myself see others desires
I want to cite a poem so usual

On the other hand
it was not just a defeat

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Articles all around us

and other types of tracking technology
was not just a defeat

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
The trackers on users

I presume to others
in the form filled offered in trust

to the other end
radiating from housing

Cereal and others’ health
I have them trust in me

I assume possession to others
