('other', 'visible')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I assumed it was visible

others desires
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

Then I can’t presume to need others
And make myself a visible

On the other hand
I assume the offers divisible

I presume to others
I assumed that they were divisible

I assume possession to others
