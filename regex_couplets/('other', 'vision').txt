('other', 'vision')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I had me a vision

On the other hand
up in the television pleasure

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
there wasn’t any television 

and other types of tracking technology
joined in my television

Cereal and others’ health
visions that can be attainable

I presume to others
