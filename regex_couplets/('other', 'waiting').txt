('other', 'waiting')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
There are spots waiting

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Though we are waiting for her

and other types of tracking technology
Though we are waiting 

I presume to others
Though we can’t help waiting

to the other end
waiting out front or up above 

I assume possession to others
