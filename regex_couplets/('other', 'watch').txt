('other', 'watch')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
when watching tv

On the other hand
in the sense of watching

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I watch a movie

and other types of tracking technology
When I'm watching my tv 

I presume to others
where I’m watching my tv

Cereal and others’ health
