('other', 'were')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
When we had jobs that were to earn

On the other hand
they were on

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

and other types of tracking technology
answered about 

I presume to others
formerly a long time they were on

to the other end
I answered what I thought

Cereal and others’ health
in the long time they were on

I assume possession to others
