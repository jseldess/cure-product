('other', 'will')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

others desires
will not be the same

On the other hand
that will spur me on

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
would only willingly break

I presume to others
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

to the other end
my daughter will learn 

Cereal and others’ health
