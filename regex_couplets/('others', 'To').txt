('others', 'To')

others desires
To my children Walt Whitman

Then I can’t presume to need others
To my chidren

If I let myself see others desires
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

I presume to others
To the ends of transactions

Cereal and others’ health
To the right of determined elections

I assume possession to others
