('others', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

others desires
and can’t presume to need

Then I can’t presume to need others
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
But I can’t let myself treat 

If I let myself see others desires
But I can’t let myself disregard

I presume to others
Though we can’t help waiting

Cereal and others’ health
I can’t remember them

I assume possession to others
