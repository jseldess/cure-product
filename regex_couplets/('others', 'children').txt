('others', 'children')

others desires
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Then I can’t presume to need others
To my children Walt Whitman

If I let myself see others desires
Even the children

I presume to others
my possession of my children

Cereal and others’ health
speech my possession of my children

I assume possession to others
