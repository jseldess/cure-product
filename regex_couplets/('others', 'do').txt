('others', 'do')

others desires
does not feel an exception

Then I can’t presume to need others
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

If I let myself see others desires
in a sharp downward turn 

I presume to others
latency which doesn’t mean anything

Cereal and others’ health
I only think I don’t listen

I assume possession to others
