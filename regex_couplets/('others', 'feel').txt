('others', 'feel')

others desires
does not feel an exception

Then I can’t presume to need others
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

If I let myself see others desires
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I presume to others
which feels most comfortable

Cereal and others’ health
which I feel formerly about for

I assume possession to others
