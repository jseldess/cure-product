('others', 'he')

others desires
The dogs and lillies

Then I can’t presume to need others
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
In the right sense

I presume to others
speak them of my possessions

Cereal and others’ health
wealth and the pace of digestion

I assume possession to others
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
