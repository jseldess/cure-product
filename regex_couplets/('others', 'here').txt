('others', 'here')

others desires
I’ll get there eventually

Then I can’t presume to need others
where I sleep at times

drifting away needs others presume desires
There are quarterly goals

If I let myself see others desires
That’s where I sleep at times

I presume to others
Where in me did I host

Cereal and others’ health
my ethereal economic relations

I assume possession to others
