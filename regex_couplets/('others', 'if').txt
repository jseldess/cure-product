('others', 'if')

others desires
drifting does not feel an exception

Then I can’t presume to need others
drifting away needs others presume desires

If I let myself see others desires
at any time it can drift again

Then I can’t presume to feed others
drifting away from the task

I presume to others
if there is anything 

Cereal and others’ health
if only on the way to the trash

I assume possession to others
