('others', 'offer')

others desires
in the form filled offered in trust

I presume to others
in the form filled offered trust

Cereal and othersâ€™ health
I assume the offers reliable

I assume possession to others
in school and can see offering

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
I assume the offers revisitable
