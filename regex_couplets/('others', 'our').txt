('others', 'our')

others desires
You can hear it also through your leisure

Then I can’t presume to need others
reasons resources

If I let myself see others desires
Two hours and

I presume to others
Who throws contours away

Cereal and others’ health
phrase them of our possessions

I assume possession to others
