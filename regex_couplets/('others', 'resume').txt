('others', 'resume')

others desires
and can’t presume to need

Then I can’t presume to need others
drifting away needs others presume desires

If I let myself see others desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
I resume unassimilable visions

I presume to others
So I presume the offers already

I assume possession to others
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
