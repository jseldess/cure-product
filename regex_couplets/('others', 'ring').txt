('others', 'ring')

others desires
bring your child along

Then I can’t presume to need others
ring

I presume to others
firing and connecting somewhere

Cereal and others’ health
The prospect for veering healthily

I assume possession to others
in school and can see offering

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
Or can have seen offering possession
