('others', 'so')

others desires
You can hear it also through your leisure

Then I can’t presume to need others
reasons resources

If I let myself see others desires
I’ll pull myself another personality type

I presume to others
so still watch them

Cereal and others’ health
buy in the sound privacy

I assume possession to others
