('others', 'time.')

others desires
where I sleep at times

drifting away needs others presume desires
at any time it can drift again

Then I can’t presume to need others
Then I constellate my time family country

I presume to others
formerly a long time they were on

Cereal and others’ health
in the long time they were on

I assume possession to others
