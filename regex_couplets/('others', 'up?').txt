('others', 'up?')

others desires
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Then I can’t presume to need others
as an impure product

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
as a pure product

If I let myself see others desires
But I can’t let myself treat 

I presume to others
own stays brought loyal

Cereal and others’ health
about 

I assume possession to others
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
