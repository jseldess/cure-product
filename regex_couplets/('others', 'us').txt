('others', 'us')

others desires
slow asynchronous

Then I can’t presume to need others
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

If I let myself see others desires
I want to cite a poem so usual

I presume to others
in the form filled offered in trust

Cereal and others’ health
I have them trust in me

I assume possession to others
