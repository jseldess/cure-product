('our', 'That')

reasons resources
That’s exaclty what I want for them

You can hear it also through your leisure
That’s where I sleep at times

Two hours and
That’s when they really take

or an available resource
That you can see only the back of

with four key value pairs
That company creates a life

or alter of course the time anyway
That are my right to say

phrase them of our possessions
