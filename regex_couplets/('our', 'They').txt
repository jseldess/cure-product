('our', 'They')

reasons resources
Theyâ€™re just not mine

You can hear it also through your leisure
They are called aspirational

your bid to the next highest ranked network
They can be waived

or alter of course the time anyway
They have very many choices

Who throws contours away
They were filters

phrase them of our possessions
