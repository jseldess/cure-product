('our', 'away')

reasons resources
drifting away

conversations with our purchase
drifting away needs others presume desires

bring your child along
drifting away needs

You can hear it also through your leisure
Who throws contours away

who throws contours a way
Formerly away there are constant ways

The contours exchange with you
formerly away

phrase them of our possessions
