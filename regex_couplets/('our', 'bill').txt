('our', 'bill')

reasons resources
I hear it between bills and stuff

or an available resource
I can hear it between bills and stuff

You can hear it also through your leisure
billowing in the cloud

or alter of course the time anyway
the bill my detuning 

phrase them of our possessions
between bills and stuffed animals

own best form to ourselves
bills and stuffed animals
