('our', 'child')

reasons resources
On a snow day with my children

conversations with our purchase
especially in a child

You can hear it also through your leisure
To my children Walt Whitman

bring your child along
bearing children along

Two hours and
even my child

or alter of course the time anyway
my possession of my children

Who throws contours away
speech my possession of my children

phrase them of our possessions
