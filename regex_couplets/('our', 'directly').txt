('our', 'directly')

reasons resources
if not directly on my skin

Of course there is a direction
of not directly from my skin

You can hear it also through your leisure
But not to me directly

or an available resource
The sun high enough to enter directly 

or alter of course the time anyway
The sun high enough to strike directly
