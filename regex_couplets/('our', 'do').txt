('our', 'do')

reasons resources
in a sharp downward turn 

conversations with our purchase
does not feel an exception

You can hear it also through your leisure
The dogs and lillies

bring your child along
What does it mean to drift

Two hours and
I brought my head down

or an available resource
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

with four key value pairs
What I do in my liesure

or alter of course the time anyway
and it doesn’t take long

Who throws contours away
I only think I don’t listen
