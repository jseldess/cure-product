('our', 'enter')

reasons resources
I have entered my phone

conversations with our purchase
The sun high enough to enter directly 

or alter of course the time anyway
I have entered my purposes

This is your chance
I have entered my purchases

Who throws contours away
I had entered my phone

phrase them of our possessions
