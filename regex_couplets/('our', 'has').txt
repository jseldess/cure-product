('our', 'has')

reasons resources
conversations with our purchase

conversations with our reactions
Before anyone has walked across the opening

You can hear it also through your leisure
It has been since

Two hours and
in traversing my purchase

or alter of course the time anyway
if that has anything

This is your voice 
I have entered my purchases

This is your chance
the impulse for my own purchases

Who throws contours away
phase decisioned by the prospect

phrase them of our possessions
phase decisioned
