('our', 'he')

reasons resources
where I sleep at times

conversations with our purchase
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

conversations with our reactions
Then fall then summer

conversations with our feelings
Of course there is a direction

conversation with our feelings
Before anyone buys up the opening

You can hear it also through your leisure
The dogs and lillies

bring your child along
without imparting the cynicism

Two hours and
 and time in the train

May I have your zip code
Then I cannot see face value

or an available resource
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

with four key value pairs
in front of the set of regulations

your bid to the next highest ranked network
the next network in your ranking

or alter of course the time anyway
Though we are waiting for her

This is your voice 
To neither study

This is your choice 
To substitute neither study

This is your chance
I send and retrieve the impulse

Who throws contours away
To the ends of my transactions

who throws contours a way
There are constant ways

The contours exchange with you
to their other end

to their other contours
who know the ways to their other end

phrase them of our possessions
phrase them

own best form to ourselves
the people in home form

ensure to ourselves
that agreed to one the people

and our 
the people in own form

more to ourselves insure
the people in form own

home rest form to ourselves 
buy in the sound privacy
