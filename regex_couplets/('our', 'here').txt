('our', 'here')

reasons resources
where I sleep at times

conversations with our purchase
Of course there is a direction

conversation with our feelings
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

You can hear it also through your leisure
I’ll get there eventually

bring your child along
There are quarterly goals

Two hours and
Where official policy is to catch and release

or an available resource
there was no promotion

with four key value pairs
There was very little physical activity

or alter of course the time anyway
Where in me did I host

This is your voice 
and elsewhere my memory of you

This is your chance
where I send and relive aside

Who throws contours away
There are constant ways

The contours exchange with you
There are no constant waves

phrase them of our possessions
The prospects there already

own best form to ourselves
The offers there already
