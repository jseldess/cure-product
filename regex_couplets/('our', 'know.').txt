('our', 'know.')

reasons resources
who knows the way

conversations with our purchase
how can I know without direction

You can hear it also through your leisure
I even know what I would find

or alter of course the time anyway
knowing the constituents

Who throws contours away
who know the ways to their other end

phrase them of our possessions
