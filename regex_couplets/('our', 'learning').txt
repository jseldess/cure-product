('our', 'learning')

reasons resources
in light of learning what we see

conversation with our feelings
I spend time online learning to code

or an available resource
Then I am learning to code

with four key value pairs
phase decision for learning

Who throws contours away
for learning by the prospect

phrase them of our possessions
a precision for learning
