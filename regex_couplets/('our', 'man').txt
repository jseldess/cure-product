('our', 'man')

reasons resources
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

conversations with our purchase
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

You can hear it also through your leisure
To my children Walt Whitman

bring your child along
Walt Whitman drifted

Two hours and
not many face up

or alter of course the time anyway
They have very many choices

Who throws contours away
The many transparent pixel calls

phrase them of our possessions
