('our', 'mean')

reasons resources
What does it mean to drift

You can hear it also through your leisure
My means without gravity

or alter of course the time anyway
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

Who throws contours away
The other end of means

The contours exchange with you
To the other end of means like this one

phrase them of our possessions
