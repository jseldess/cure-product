('our', 'opening')

reasons resources
Before we walk across the wide opening

conversations with our purchase
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

conversations with our reactions
Before anyone buys up the opening

Of course there is a direction
Before anyone walks across the opening

You can hear it also through your leisure
The simple act opening surmounted

or alter of course the time anyway
