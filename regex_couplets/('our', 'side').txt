('our', 'side')

reasons resources
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

conversations with our purchase
I’m simply inside

You can hear it also through your leisure
aside from the retinas

or alter of course the time anyway
But my not feeling the memory aside

Who throws contours away
But my not feeling the memory inside

phrase them of our possessions
