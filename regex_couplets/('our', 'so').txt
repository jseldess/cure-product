('our', 'so')

reasons resources
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

conversations with our purchase
When I want something

conversation with our feelings
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Of course there is a direction
You can hear it also through your leisure

bring your child along
who are so fresh and agile

Two hours and
A person from a distance

or an available resource
I’ll pull myself another personality type

with four key value pairs
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

or alter of course the time anyway
I want to cite a poem so usual

This is your voice 
More reasons around my country 

This is your chance
sound inundated for my own purchases

Who throws contours away
by in the sound privacy

phrase them of our possessions
and could be inflected with reasons

own best form to ourselves
buy in the sound privacy
