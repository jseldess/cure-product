('our', 'stay')

reasons resources
wrestling to stay still

You can hear it also through your leisure
So stay with us

or alter of course the time anyway
own stays brought loyal

Who throws contours away
own that stays brought loyal

phrase them of our possessions
home stays brought loyal

ensure to ourselves
own stays bought loyal

more to ourselves insure
bought stays own loyal
