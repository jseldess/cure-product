('our', 'time.')

reasons resources
where I sleep at times

conversations with our purchase
only fragments of time with my children

You can hear it also through your leisure
at any time it can drift again

bring your child along
over the long time up in the sky

Two hours and
 and time in the train

May I have your zip code
I spend time online learning to code

or an available resource
on the time line I was on

with four key value pairs
The long time I had a vision

or alter of course the time anyway
formerly a long time they were on

Who throws contours away
formerly along time they were on
