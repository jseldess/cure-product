('our', 'turn')

reasons resources
in a sharp downward turn 

conversations with our purchase
sudden downward turn

You can hear it also through your leisure
I keep turning back again myself

or an available resource
who knows how to turn it off

Who throws contours away
I turn not sad exactly

phrase them of our possessions
