('our', 'walk')

reasons resources
Before we walk across the wide field

conversations with our purchase
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

conversations with our reactions
Before anyone walks across the opening

You can hear it also through your leisure
there was no walking along the pleasure

or alter of course the time anyway
