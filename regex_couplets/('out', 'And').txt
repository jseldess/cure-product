('out', 'And')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
And put in place as though stationary

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
And as an extension of the values

The South Carolina primary 
And make myself a visible

out in the snow
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

without ensuing damage
And we had to say goodbye to her there

And need out in front purchase
And read out in front

Having been purchased out of you
And from a weak distance

without consumer damage
And we could inhabit the room easy

without really agreeing
