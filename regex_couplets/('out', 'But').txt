('out', 'but')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
but not impart cynicism

Which is a measure to never live out
Attributable or

A turtle fished out of the lake
but the sun isn’t up

barely outlines
but it continued

without the long time I was accounting
but they are black spots

I take it out in the snow fall
but I can hear them

Which is a pleasure to never live out
but where is it

without the long time I was on accounting
I resume attributable visions

without ensuing damage
attributable visions

purchased out
that decisions can be attributable

I answered about
but for memory elsewhere

I answered what I thought about
but standing in memory

about 
decisions that can be attributable
