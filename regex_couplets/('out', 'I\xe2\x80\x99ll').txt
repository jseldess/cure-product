('out', 'I\xe2\x80\x99ll')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
I’ll pull myself another personality type

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
I’ll get there eventually

Which is a measure to never live out
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

The South Carolina primary 
I’ll pull my data higher up

out in the snow
I’ll get there ruins

out of the remnant ruins
I’ll pull myself higher up

barely outlines
