('out', 'To')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
To my children Walt Whitman

Which is a measure to never live out
To my chidren

Without imparting cynicism 
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

The South Carolina primary 
To neither study

A turtle fished out of the lake
To that impossible place

out of later results
Tomorrow

barely outlines
Toward the start informally given my reasons

without the long time I was accounting
To substitute neither study

without really speaking
To the ends of transactions

I answered about
To the right of determined elections

which I feel formerly about for
