('out', 'Where')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
Where I sleep at times

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Where official policy is to catch and release

A turtle fished out of the lake
Where I put it beating

out of remnant ages
Where I take my liesure

I take it out in the snow fall
Where I lead gravity

without ensuing damage
Where in me did I host

without really agreeing
Where I host my purposes

The South Carolina primary 
Where in me did I last

without really speaking
Where in me did I lose

about the site
Where in me did I loose

answered about 
Where in me pre-worn

I answered about
Where in me did I lose trust

which I feel formerly about for
