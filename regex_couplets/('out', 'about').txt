('out', 'about')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
burrowed about from repeated travels

answered about 
and literally moved about

without really binding
about the site

about the site hosting
about the sight hosting trusting

by the sight of the hosting answered about
I answered about

which I feel formerly about for
not literally moved about

washed I answered about
I answered what I thought about

about
