('out', 'across')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
Before we walk across the wide field

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Before we walk across the wide opening

about my children’s consumption
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

how can I know without direction
across the retinas

without the long time I was accounting
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

without the long time I was on accounting
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
