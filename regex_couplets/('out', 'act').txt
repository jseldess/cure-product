('out', 'act')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

about my children’s consumption
In the retroactive light

how can I know without direction
I was enjoined to act again myself

The South Carolina primary 
I was enjoined to act again

out of later results
and strategies not tactics

out in the snow fall
Not goals or tactics

without the long time I was accounting
actually considering the end

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I refuse indelible tracts

Which is a pleasure to never live out
we had inhabited actually

without really agreeing
The ends of my transactions

burrowed about from repeated travels
to the ends of my transactions

without really needing
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

answered about 
To the ends of transactions

I answered about
I turn not sad exactly

not literally moved about
I return not sad exactly

which I feel formerly about for
I returned not sad exactly

behind or out front or up above
before I act on them
