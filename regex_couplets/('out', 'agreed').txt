('out', 'agreed')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
and to which I’ve agreed

without really agreeing
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

without really speaking
and for which the plan agreed

without really binding
that agreed one of rest

without really needing
and to which the plan agreed

answered about 
that agreed home
