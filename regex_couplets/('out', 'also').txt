('out', 'also')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
You can hear it also through your leisure

Which is a measure to never live out
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

without the long time I was accounting
I cannot clear it also through investiture

Which is a pleasure to never live out
also didnâ€™t really move

which I feel formerly about for
