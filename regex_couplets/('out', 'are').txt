('out', 'are')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
Though there are quarters goals

how can I know without direction
there are quarters 

Though how can you know without direction
though there are quarters with goals

for how can you know without direction
who are so fresh and agile

The South Carolina primary 
barely outlines

out in the snow
They are called aspirational

without the long time I was accounting
but they are black spots

I take it out in the snow fall
I believe I can prepare for it

that I hear without trying
There are spots waiting

without ensuing damage
Though we are waiting for her

without really agreeing
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

without really speaking
though we are breaking in the space that it had

without really breaking
Though we are waiting 

without really binding
still carefully

answered about
There are constant ways

I answered about
That are my right to say

about 
 as points which are my interest 

which I feel formerly about for
careening between the preambles
