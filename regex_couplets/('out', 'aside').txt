('out', 'aside')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
aside from the retinas

without the long time I was accounting
But my not feeling the memory aside

without really speaking
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

without really breaking
where I send and relive aside

burrowed about from repeated travels
where I am aside

without really branding 
where I send and retrieve aside

answered about 
But my feeling the memory aside

which I feel formerly about for
