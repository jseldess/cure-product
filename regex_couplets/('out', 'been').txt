('out', 'been')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
It has been since

The South Carolina primary 
After having been contented

Which is a pleasure to never live out
that having been after content

barely outlines
having been graspable

without ensuing damage
having been an ungraspable time

purchased out
having been purchased out

having been purchased out of you
