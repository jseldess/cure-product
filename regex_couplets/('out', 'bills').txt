('out', 'bills')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
between bills and stuffed animals

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
I hear it between bills and stuff

out in the snow
I can hear it between bills and stuff

without the long time I was accounting
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I take it out in the snow fall
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

Which is a pleasure to never live out
bills and stuffed animals
