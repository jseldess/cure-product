('out', 'brought')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
at home brought into privacy

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
I brought my head down

A turtle fished out of the lake
I brought my qualities down

out of remnant ages
own stays brought loyal

without really agreeing
own that stays brought loyal

I answered about
already brought into privacy
