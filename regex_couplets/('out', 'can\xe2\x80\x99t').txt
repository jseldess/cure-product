('out', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
I can’t fix them without direction

Though how can you know without direction
and can’t presume to need

Without a proposed budget
Then I can’t presume to need others

The South Carolina primary 
But I can’t let myself treat 

Which is a measure to never live out
That can’t be glimpsed

without the long time I was accounting
Though we can’t help waiting

I answered about
I can’t remember them

into the mouth
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
