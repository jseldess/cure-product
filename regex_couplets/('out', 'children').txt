('out', 'children')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
On a snow day with my children

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
as pure as my children

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
my children’s consumption

about my children’s consumption
only fragments of time with my children

how can I know without direction
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Which is a measure to never live out
To my children Walt Whitman

Without imparting cynicism 
bearing children along

The South Carolina primary 
Even the children

And need out in front purchase
my possession of my children

without really agreeing
speech my possession of my children

I answered about
