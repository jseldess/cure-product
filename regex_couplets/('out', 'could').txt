('out', 'could')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
and could be mapped and weighed

out of remnant ages
until I could not tire 

without the long time I was accounting
until I could not be tired

Which is a pleasure to never live out
until I could not be hired

without the long time I was on accounting
I could in effect credit

without ensuing damage
I could consume the dream

purchased out
and we could inhabit the room easy

without really agreeing
and could be inflected with reasons
