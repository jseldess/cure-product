('out', 'day')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
On a snow day with my children

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
One day there is direction

how can I know without direction
I argued the days felt longer

out in the snow fall
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

without the long time I was accounting
The day

without really agreeing
I have a memory between the day

Which is a pleasure to never live out
at least most days

which I feel formerly about for
