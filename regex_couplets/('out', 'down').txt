('out', 'down')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
in a sharp downward turn 

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
In a sharp downard turn

about my children’s consumption
It keeps coming down thankfully

how can I know without direction
to the down arrow

The South Carolina primary 
I brought my head down

A turtle fished out of the lake
I brought my qualities down

out of remnant ages
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

without ensuing damage
