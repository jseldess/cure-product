('out', 'edge')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
I step off the edge

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Face falling off the edge of the face

about my children’s consumption
value falling off the edge of the face

how can I know without direction
The edge is put in place

I can’t fix them without direction
I step over the edge

for how can you know without direction
If I step over the edge

Which is a measure to never live out
off the edge of the world

The South Carolina primary 
Falling off the edge of the face

out in the snow
The value falling off the edge of th face

barely outlines
and testing the edge and gravity

out in the snow fall
