('out', 'fall')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
Then fall then summer from my face

about my children’s consumption
Then fall then summer

how can I know without direction
and not falling at all

The South Carolina primary 
Face falling off the edge of the face

Which is a measure to never live out
The value falling off the edge of the face

out in the snow
The value falling off the edge of th face

barely outlines
I see only the back of falling values

out in the snow fall
out in the snow falling face value

without the long time I was accounting
I take it out in the snow fall

What would I feel without that goal
falling off the end

that I hear without trying
falling off the encoded end

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
