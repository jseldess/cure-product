('out', 'feel')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
conversations with our feelings

how can I know without direction
does not feel an exception

Which is a measure to never live out
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Without imparting cynicism 
I tried to feel the key values extending 

out in the snow fall
I tried to feel the extension of key values

without the long time I was accounting
What would I feel without that goal

What would I feel without a goal
But my not feeling the memory aside

without really speaking
But my not feeling the memory inside

burrowed about from repeated travels
which feels most comfortable

without really binding
which feels more comfortable

without really needing
which is what feels most comfortable

about the site
which I feel formerly about for

not literally moved about
By my feeling the memory inside

I answered about
But my feeling the memory aside

I answered what I thought about
