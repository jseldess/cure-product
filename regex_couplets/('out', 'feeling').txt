('out', 'feeling')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
conversations with our feelings

how can I know without direction
But my not feeling the memory aside

without really speaking
But my not feeling the memory inside

burrowed about from repeated travels
By my feeling the memory inside

I answered about
But my feeling the memory aside

which I feel formerly about for
