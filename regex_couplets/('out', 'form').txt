('out', 'form')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
There are performance reviews

The South Carolina primary 
Toward the start informally given my reasons

without the long time I was accounting
already formerly a long time

without really agreeing
A way formerly like this one

without really speaking
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

without really breaking
already formely a long time

burrowed about from repeated travels
in the form filled offered in trust

without really binding
with dawn already formerly nights 

without really needing
in the form filled offered trust

answered about 
which I feel formerly about for

not literally moved about
in the form filled offered must

I answered about
dawn formerly

I answered what I thought about
shone formerly along time

about 
own best form
