('out', 'from')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
Then fall then summer from my face

about my children’s consumption
Falling from this distance

how can I know without direction
Falling from my face

The South Carolina primary 
drifting away from the task

Which is a measure to never live out
A person from a distance

out of remnant ages
out from below the fold

out of the fifth page ruins
emerging this year from standing water

out in the snow
Having transitioned from leisure to work

barely outlines
It’s the third letter from the end

out in the snow fall
aside from the retinas

without the long time I was accounting
from which to step off

I take it out in the snow fall
I get from here through there

without ensuing damage
get from here through there

purchased out
And from a weak distance

without consumer damage
breaking from my constituents

burrowed about from repeated travels
from cables reheated travels

without really branding 
from no one point

answered about 
deep into pathways from repeated travels

which I feel formerly about for
radiating from housing

I answered about
