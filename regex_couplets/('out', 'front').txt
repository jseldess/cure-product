('out', 'front')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

how can I know without direction
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

Some disease effecting the tree out front
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

barely outlines
in front of the set afternoon

out in the snow fall
in front of the set of regulations

without the long time I was accounting
And need out in front purchase

And read out in front
behind or out front or up above

out front
waiting out front or up above 

in the space out front
waiting out front or up above or behind

in the fill space out front
