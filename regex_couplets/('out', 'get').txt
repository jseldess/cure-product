('out', 'get')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
I’ll get there eventually

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
and is relentlessly budgeted

Without a proposed budget
and without a proposed budget

Without imparting cynicism 
I’ll get there ruins

out of the remnant ruins
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

barely outlines
I get through there

without ensuing damage
in traversing get through there

purchased out
forgetting decisions 

without really agreeing
forgettable
