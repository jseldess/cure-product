('out', 'goals')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
Though there are quarters goals

how can I know without direction
We can wrestle them with their goals

Though how can you know without direction
With goals 

for how can you know without direction
and without quartely goals

and without a proposed budget
There are quarterly goals

The South Carolina primary 
before morning goals

barely outlines
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

out in the snow
Strategy comes before goals

out in the snow fall
not goals

out in the snow falling face value
Not goals or tactics

without the long time I was accounting
