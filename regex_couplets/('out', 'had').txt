('out', 'had')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
If he had not carried one virtue

Which is a pleasure to never live out
When we had jobs that were to earn

The South Carolina primary 
I had me a vision

out in the snow
Since I had to hold the entire company

without the long time I was accounting
The long time I had a vision

I take it out in the snow fall
I had a vision

without the long time I was on accounting
we had to say goodbye

Having been purchased out of you
And we had to say goodbye to her there

And need out in front purchase
We had to say goodbye there

And read out in front
that nothing had gravity

My means without gravity
so that nothing had gravity

without longer damage
we had inhabited actually

without really agreeing
in the face that I had

without really speaking
though we are breaking in the space that it had

without really breaking
which had on honor to be told

without really branding 
in the space that it had

without really binding
in the face that it had

answered about 
I had entered my phone

I answered about
