('out', 'have')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
We’ll have coffee this morning

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
I have entered my phone

about my children’s consumption
before we can have a retroactive

how can I know without direction
if you have providence to excess

Which is a pleasure to never live out
If you have confidence regardless all else

The South Carolina primary 
May I have your zip code

A turtle fished out of the lake
I have them lost

without ensuing damage
I have supporters

without consumer damage
I have a memory between the day

without really agreeing
I have entered my purposes

without really speaking
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

answered about 
I have turned it off

I answered about
I have them trust in me

into the mouth
I have seen more than I can remember
