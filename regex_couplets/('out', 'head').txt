('out', 'head')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
Without a head

and without quartely goals
I brought my head down

A turtle fished out of the lake
I search with my head

out of remnant ages
into the next level head

without the long time I was accounting
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
