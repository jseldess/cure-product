('out', 'hear')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
You can hear it also through your leisure

Which is a measure to never live out
and my heart rate

A turtle fished out of the lake
and my heartrate

out of remnant ages
I hear it between bills and stuff

out in the snow
I can hear it between bills and stuff

without the long time I was accounting
that I can hear

I take it out in the snow fall
that I hear without trying

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
as far back as my history heard

Which is a pleasure to never live out
In my heart did I lose trust

I answered about
