('out', 'hold')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
I take hold of my finger

The South Carolina primary 
When they really take hold of my finger

out of remnant ages
Since I had to hold the entire company

without the long time I was accounting
and hold and wish to hold

without ensuing damage
designed to hold up my underwear

without consumer damage
