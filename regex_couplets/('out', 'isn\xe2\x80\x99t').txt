('out', 'isn\xe2\x80\x99t')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
The sun isn’t up 

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
The edge isn’t even there

I can’t fix them without direction
Then the sun isn’t available

The South Carolina primary 
Then the sun isn’t up

A turtle fished out of the lake
but the sun isn’t up

barely outlines
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

out in the snow
