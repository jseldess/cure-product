('out', 'live')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
I am to end my connections suspended live

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Which is a measure to never live out

Without a proposed budget
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Which is a pleasure to never live out
where I send and relive aside

without really speaking
where I send and relive would be held

without really breaking
where I send and relive

burrowed about from repeated travels
where I stand and retrieve and relive

without really branding 
where I stand and relive

answered about 
where I end and relive

which I feel formerly about for
