('out', 'myself')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
So I find myself at home

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
But I can’t let myself treat 

Without a proposed budget
I’ll pull myself another personality type

The South Carolina primary 
I let myself treat

Which is a measure to never live out
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

out in the snow
I keep turning back again myself

A turtle fished out of the lake
I was enjoined to act again myself

barely outlines
off the end myself

without the long time I was accounting
myself

without really binding myself
myself moved literally as it is

and literally moved about
the least productive of myself

which I feel formerly about for
So I found myself at home
