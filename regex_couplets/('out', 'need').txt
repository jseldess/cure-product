('out', 'need')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

how can I know without direction
and can’t presume to need

Without a proposed budget
drifting away needs

The South Carolina primary 
Then I can’t presume to need others

Which is a measure to never live out
I need the work

without the long time I was accounting
I need an explicit statement

Which is a pleasure to never live out
which I needed for an explicit state

without the long time I was on accounting
And need out in front purchase

And read out in front
where I need gravity

without ensuing damage
I tell you where I need gravity

without consumer damage
not needing to wait

burrowed about from repeated travels
without really needing

and literally moved about
in need one in that best own

without really agreeing
need one in best own

I answered about
that in need one best own
