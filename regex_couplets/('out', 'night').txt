('out', 'night')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
battery dawn nights blending themselves

about my children’s consumption
blue and sun again a second, then night

out in the snow
I had nightmares though

without the long time I was accounting
dawn already formerly nights 

without really agreeing
last night

without really branding 
with dawn already formerly nights 

without really needing
battery dawn nights 

I answered about
battery dawn nights ending themselves

I answered what I thought about
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

about
