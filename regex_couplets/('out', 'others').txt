('out', 'others')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
others desires

Which is a measure to never live out
Then I can’t presume to need others

Without a proposed budget
If I let myself see others desires

The South Carolina primary 
I presume to others

without really agreeing
Cereal and others’ health

about 
I assume possession to others
