('out', 'presume')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
So I presume the offers already

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
and can’t presume to need

Without a proposed budget
Then I can’t presume to need others

The South Carolina primary 
I continue to presume

without ensuing damage
I presume to others

without really agreeing
I presume the offers
