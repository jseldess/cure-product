('out', 'principle')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
under the last seen principle

without ensuing damage
Under the grass principle

purchased out
Under the grasp principle

having been purchased out
Under the last principle 

having been purchased out of you
Under the last principle of purchasing power

And need out in front purchase
Under the past principle

And read out in front
