('out', 'product')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
an impure product

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
What is an impure product

about my children’s consumption
as a cure product

Which is a measure to never live out
as a pure product

Without a proposed budget
as an impure product

The South Carolina primary 
the least productive of myself

which I feel formerly about for
