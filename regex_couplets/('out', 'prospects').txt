('out', 'prospects')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
The prospects there already

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
the impulse for my own prospects

without really speaking
the impulse my own prospects

without really breaking
speech that is of by prospects

I answered about
the prospects being seen by me
