('out', 'purpose')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
by no ventillation my purpose

out in the snow
until my purpose up in the sky

barely outlines
until I purpose the horizon

without the long time I was accounting
of my purpose in versing

without ensuing damage
In conversing of my purpose

purchased out
My purpose up in the sky

And need out in front purchase
Until my purpose 

Having been purchased out of you
I tell you my purposes

without consumer damage
Where I host my purposes

The South Carolina primary 
I have entered my purposes

without really speaking
the impulse for my own purposes

without really breaking
the impulse to my purpose

burrowed about from repeated travels
to the other end of my purpose

I answered about
aside the impulse to my purpose

answered about 
for my own purposes

which I feel formerly about for
