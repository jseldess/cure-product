('out', 'purposes')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
I tell you my purposes

without ensuing damage
I tell you the weight of my purposes

without consumer damage
Where I host my purposes

The South Carolina primary 
I have entered my purposes

without really speaking
the impulse for my own purposes

without really breaking
for my own purposes

which I feel formerly about for
