('out', 'really')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
because it was really dark

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
it was really sunny

about my children’s consumption
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

how can I know without direction
When they really take hold of my finger

out of remnant ages
without really agreeing

Which is a pleasure to never live out
without really speaking

without really breaking
without really branding 

without really binding myself
without really binding

without their agreement
without really needing

and literally moved about
also didn’t really move

which I feel formerly about for
