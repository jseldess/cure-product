('out', 'resume')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
So I presume the offers already

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
and can’t presume to need

Without a proposed budget
Then I can’t presume to need others

The South Carolina primary 
I resume unassimilable visions

without the long time I was accounting
I resume indelible tracks

Which is a pleasure to never live out
I resume attributable visions

without the long time I was on accounting
I continue to presume

without ensuing damage
I presume to others

without really agreeing
I presume the offers
