('out', 'say')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
we had to say goodbye

Having been purchased out of you
And we had to say goodbye to her there

And need out in front purchase
We had to say goodbye there

And read out in front
I ask say in that case

without really agreeing
we ask say in that case

I answered about
formerly along my say to the elections

about 
I ask say in that phase decisioned
