('out', 'sky')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
over the long time up in the sky

The South Carolina primary 
over the long line up in the sky

out in the snow
Blue sky or

A turtle fished out of the lake
until my purpose up in the sky

barely outlines
though not many facts up in the sky

without the long time I was accounting
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Up in the sky

And need out in front purchase
My purpose up in the sky

Having been purchased out of you
While theyâ€™re up in the sky

without ensuing damage
until I purchase up the sky

without consumer damage
