('out', 'sleep')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
Where I sleep at times

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
So I went back to sleep

about my children’s consumption
That’s where I sleep at times

The South Carolina primary 
Interrupted sleep or

A turtle fished out of the lake
While I should be sleeping 

out of remnant ages
like flattening sleep 

without the long time I was accounting
like sleep

without ensuing damage
