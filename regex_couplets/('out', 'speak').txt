('out', 'speak')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
not speaking

without really speaking

burrowed about from repeated travels
would only speak willingly

without really branding 
I speak to them my possessions

without their agreement
I speak them of my possessions

without really agreeing
speak them of my possessions

I answered about
