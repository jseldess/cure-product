('out', 'step')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
I step off the edge

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
I step over the edge

for how can you know without direction
If I step over the edge

Which is a measure to never live out
What the next step

out in the snow 
What’s the next step

out in the snow fall
The next step 

without the long time I was accounting
from which to step off

I take it out in the snow fall
step in by the prospect

I answered about
phase decision step in
