('out', 'themselves')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
battery dawn nights blending themselves

about my childrenâ€™s consumption
talking into pheasants bending themselves

without the long time I was accounting
talking into percents bending themselves

without the long time I was on accounting
walking into percents blending themselves

without ensuing damage
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

burrowed about from repeated travels
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

I answered about
battery dawn nights ending themselves

I answered what I thought about
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

about
