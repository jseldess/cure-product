('out', 'through')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
You can hear it also through your leisure

Which is a measure to never live out
Back up through the results

out of remnant ages
back up through results

out of later results
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

without the long time I was accounting
I cannot clear it also through investiture

Which is a pleasure to never live out
I get through there

without ensuing damage
in traversing get through there

purchased out
