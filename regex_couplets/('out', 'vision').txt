('out', 'vision')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
I had me a vision

out in the snow
The planning process for visions

out in the snow fall
The planning process is for visionaries only

out in the snow falling face value
aspirating visions

without the long time I was accounting
there wasnâ€™t any television 

I take it out in the snow fall
I resume unassimilable visions

that I hear without trying
The long time I had a vision

Which is a pleasure to never live out
The long time I was a vision

without the long time I was on accounting
I resume attributable visions

without ensuing damage
attributable visions

purchased out
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

without really agreeing
joined in my television

which I feel formerly about for
visions that can be attainable
