('out', 'waiting')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
There are spots waiting

without ensuing damage
Though we are waiting for her

without really agreeing
Though we are waiting 

without really binding
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

I answered about
waiting out front or up above 

in the space out front
waiting out front or up above or behind

in the fill space out front
