('out', 'were')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
When we had jobs that were to earn

The South Carolina primary 
my desires were open

out of remnant ages
I argued the days were longer

without the long time I was accounting
they were on

without ensuing damage
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

without really agreeing
answered about 

without really branding 
formerly a long time they were on

without really needing
by the sight of the hosting answered about

I answered about
washed I answered about

which I feel formerly about for
in the long time they were on

I answered what I thought about
I answered what I thought

about 
that they were visible
