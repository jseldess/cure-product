('out', 'world')

Arrayed out in such a nested way
off the edge of the world

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Which can be pronounced to the world

The South Carolina primary 
The world 

Which is a pleasure to never live out
off the end of the world

without the long time I was accounting
hauling off the end of the world

I take it out in the snow fall
falling off the end of the world

that I hear without trying
the opinions in my world

without really branding
