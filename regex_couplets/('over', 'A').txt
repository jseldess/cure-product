('over', 'A')

I step over the edge
And as an extension of the values

over the long time up in the sky
And make myself a visible

over the time line I was on
After having been contented

hovering above standing water
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

over the long time I was on
THE PLANNING PROCESS

oddly grown over with historic bark
Aspirational strategy

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
A defeated

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
