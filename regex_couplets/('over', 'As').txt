('over', 'As')

I step over the edge
Assimilable or

hovering above standing water
Aspirational strategy

oddly grown over with historic bark
As an extension of the values

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
As a clone, illegally conceived

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
