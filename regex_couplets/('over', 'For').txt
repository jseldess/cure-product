('over', 'For')

I step over the edge
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

over the long time up in the sky
Forecasting the story before dawn

over the time line I was on
For an ungraspable time

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
For Mitt Romney

For my own purchases

for not paying sound overwhelmed
Formerly a way like this one

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
