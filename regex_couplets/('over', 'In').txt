('over', 'IN')

I step over the edge
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

hovering above standing water
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

over the long time I was on
THE PLANNING PROCESS

oddly grown over with historic bark
ASPIRATING VISIONS

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
By NATASHA SINGER

for not paying sound overwhelmed
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
