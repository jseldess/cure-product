('over', 'Or')

I step over the edge
Or the company

hovering above standing water
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Or alter of course the time anyway

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
Or can have seen offering possession

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
