('over', 'so')

I step over the edge
You can hear it also through your leisure

over the long time up in the sky
reasons resources

over the time line I was on
soft paper

hovering above standing water
or an available resource

over the long line up in the sky
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

oddly grown over with historic bark
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
Toward the start informally given my reasons

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
sound inundated for my own purchases

for not paying sound overwhelmed
so still watch them

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
and could be inflected with reasons
