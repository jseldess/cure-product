('over', 'THE')

I step over the edge
THE SNOW

over the long time up in the sky
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

hovering above standing water
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

over the long time I was on
THE PLANNING PROCESS

oddly grown over with historic bark
THE OFFERS

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
