('over', 'That')

I step over the edge
That’s where I sleep at times

over the long time up in the sky
That’s when they really take

hovering above standing water
That you can see only the back of

oddly grown over with historic bark
That company creates a life

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
That I captured an afterimage

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
That are my right to say

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
