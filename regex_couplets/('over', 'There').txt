('over', 'There')

I step over the edge
There are quarterly goals

over the long time up in the sky
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

hovering above standing water
There was very little physical activity

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
There are spots waiting

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
There are constant ways

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
