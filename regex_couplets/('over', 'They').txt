('over', 'They')

I step over the edge
Theyâ€™re just not mine

If I step over the edge
They are called aspirational

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
They can be waived

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
They have very many choices

for not paying sound overwhelmed
They were filters

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
