('over', 'though')

I step over the edge
though there are quarters with goals

If I step over the edge
though it was most emphatically that

hovering above standing water
I had nightmares though

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I thought

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
though we are still breaking in

for not paying sound overwhelmed
after though thereâ€™s no memory

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
