('over', 'To')

I step over the edge
To my children Walt Whitman

over the long time up in the sky
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

hovering above standing water
Tomorrow

oddly grown over with historic bark
Toward the start informally given my reasons

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
To neither study
