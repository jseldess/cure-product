('over', 'We')

I step over the edge
We had to say goodbye there

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
We had inhabited actually

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
We got paid one way by a voice

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
We ask say in that case

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
