('over', 'Which')

I step over the edge
Which is a measure to never live out

over the long time up in the sky
Which can be pronounced to the world

hovering above standing water
Which is a pleasure to never live out

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
Which can be called confidence

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
