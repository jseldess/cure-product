('over', 'while')

I step over the edge
Looking back while I should be sleeping

hovering above standing water
while wrapped in static

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
while wrapped in explicit static

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
while consuming damage

I answered while interfaced

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
