('over', 'You')

I step over the edge
You can hear it also through your leisure

over the long time up in the sky
You use the most essential parts

hovering above standing water
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
You need history

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
You can have seen offering
