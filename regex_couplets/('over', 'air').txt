('over', 'air')

I step over the edge
Puffs of air

over the long time up in the sky
and key value pairs

oddly grown over with historic bark
with key value pairs

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
