('over', 'any')

I step over the edge
at any time it can drift again

over the long time up in the sky
Or the company

hovering above standing water
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I walk up and don’t work anymore

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
They have very many choices

for not paying sound overwhelmed
latency which doesn’t mean anything

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
