('over', 'bill')

I step over the edge
I hear it between bills and stuff

over the long time up in the sky
I can hear it between bills and stuff

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
billowing in the cloud

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
until the bill came

the bill my detuning 

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
