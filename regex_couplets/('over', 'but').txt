('over', 'but')

I step over the edge
but not impart cynicism

over the long time up in the sky
Attributable or

hovering above standing water
but the sun isnâ€™t up

oddly grown over with historic bark
but it continued

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
but where is it

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
that decisions can be attributable

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
