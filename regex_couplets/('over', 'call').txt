('over', 'call')

I step over the edge
though it was most emphatically that

hovering above standing water
They are called aspirational

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
Which can be called confidence

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
to take the call

for not paying sound overwhelmed
The many transparent pixel calls

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
