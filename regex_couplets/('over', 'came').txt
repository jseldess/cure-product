('over', 'came')

I step over the edge
I invited most of what came next

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I came back to me

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I came after my past

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
and came home to rewind inflections

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
