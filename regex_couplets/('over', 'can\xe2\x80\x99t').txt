('over', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

I step over the edge
and can’t presume to need

over the long time up in the sky
Then I can’t presume to need others

over the time line I was on
That can’t be glimpsed

oddly grown over with historic bark
Though we can’t help waiting

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
