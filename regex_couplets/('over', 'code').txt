('over', 'code')

I step over the edge
May I have your zip code

hovering above standing water
learned without too much difficulty to code

oddly grown over with historic bark
falling off the encoded end

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
zipcode

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
