('over', 'could')

I step over the edge
and could be mapped and weighed

hovering above standing water
until I could not tire 

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
until I could not be tired

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I could consume the dream

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
and could be inflected with reasons

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
