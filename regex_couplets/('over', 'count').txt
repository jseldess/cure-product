('over', 'count')

I step over the edge
Then I constellate my time family country

over the long time up in the sky
So I constellate the time family country

over the time line I was on
I brought my count down

hovering above standing water
without the long time I was accounting

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
around my country 

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
More reasons around my country
