('over', 'data')

I step over the edge
I’ll pull my data higher up

over the long time up in the sky
I’ll pull my data

over the time line I was on
The days of private data

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
trackers collecting data on users

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
my interfaced stand data

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
