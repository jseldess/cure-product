('over', 'day')

I step over the edge
I argued the days felt longer

oddly grown over with historic bark
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
The day

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
at least most days

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
