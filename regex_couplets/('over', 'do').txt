('over', 'do')

I step over the edge
does not feel an exception

over the long time up in the sky
in a sharp downward turn 

over the time line I was on
The dogs and lillies

hovering above standing water
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

oddly grown over with historic bark
What I do in my liesure

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I walk up and don’t work anymore

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
here is the site of the battle of maldon

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
and it doesn’t take long

for not paying sound overwhelmed
latency which doesn’t mean anything

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
