('over', 'earn')

I step over the edge
When we had jobs that were to earn

hovering above standing water
learned without too much difficulty to code

oddly grown over with historic bark
where you can earn more 

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
decisioned to learn 

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
