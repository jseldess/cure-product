('over', 'eat')

I step over the edge
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

over the long time up in the sky
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

over the time line I was on
was not just a defeat

hovering above standing water
executive breath

over the long line up in the sky
of the habits I create

oddly grown over with historic bark
of the habits they create.

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
it was not just a defeat

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
And from that great distance

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
for the creation of the universe

for not paying sound overwhelmed
burrowed about from repeated travels

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
