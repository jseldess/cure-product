('over', 'else')

I step over the edge
If you have confidence regardless all else

hovering above standing water
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
and elsewhere my memory

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
elsewhere my purposes

for not paying sound overwhelmed
elsewhere by my memory

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
