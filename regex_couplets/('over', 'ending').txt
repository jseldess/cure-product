('over', 'ending')

I step over the edge
I tried to feel the key values extending 

oddly grown over with historic bark
talking into pheasants bending themselves

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
talking into percents bending themselves

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

for not paying sound overwhelmed
battery dawn nights blending themselves

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
