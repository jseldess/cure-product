('over', 'enter')

I step over the edge
The sun high enough to enter directly 

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I enter the flattening mirror

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I have entered my purposes

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
I have entered my phone

for not paying sound overwhelmed
I had entered my phone

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
