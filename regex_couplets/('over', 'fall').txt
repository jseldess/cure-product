('over', 'fall')

I step over the edge
Then fall then summer

over the long time up in the sky
and not falling at all

over the time line I was on
Face falling off the edge of the face

over the long line up in the sky
I see only the back of falling values

oddly grown over with historic bark
falling off the encoded end

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
