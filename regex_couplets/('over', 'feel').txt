('over', 'feel')

I step over the edge
does not feel an exception

over the long time up in the sky
I tried to feel the key values extending 

oddly grown over with historic bark
I tried to feel the extension of key values

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
But my not feeling the memory aside

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
But my not feeling the memory inside

for not paying sound overwhelmed
which feels most comfortable

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
