('over', 'find')

I step over the edge
with goals I find there

If I step over the edge
what I find there

over the long time up in the sky
Companies increasingly find 

oddly grown over with historic bark
I even know what I would find

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
So I find myself at home

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
