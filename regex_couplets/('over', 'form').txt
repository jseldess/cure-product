('over', 'form')

I step over the edge
There are performance reviews

over the long time up in the sky
Toward the start informally given my reasons

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
already formerly a long time

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
A way formerly like this one

for not paying sound overwhelmed
in the form filled offered in trust

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
