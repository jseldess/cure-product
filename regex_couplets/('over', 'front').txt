('over', 'front')

I step over the edge
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

hovering above standing water
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

oddly grown over with historic bark
in front of the set of regulations

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
And need out in front purchase

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
behind or out front or up above

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
