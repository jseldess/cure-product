('over', 'goal')

I step over the edge
though there are quarters with goals

If I step over the edge
and without quartely goals

over the long time up in the sky
There are quarterly goals

over the time line I was on
before morning goals

oddly grown over with historic bark
Not goals or tactics

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
