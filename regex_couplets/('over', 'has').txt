('over', 'has')

I step over the edge
It has been since

over the long time up in the sky
in traversing my purchase

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
purchased out

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
if that has anything

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
washed my purchases

for not paying sound overwhelmed
phase decisioned by the prospect

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
