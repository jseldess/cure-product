('over', 'he')

I step over the edge
though there are quarters with goals

If I step over the edge
what I find there

over the long time up in the sky
I’ll get there eventually

over the time line I was on
I am the first in the office

over the long line up in the sky
over the long line I would honor

hovering above standing water
high up in the architecture

over the long time I was on
until my purpose up in the sky

oddly grown over with historic bark
What’s the next step

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
advancing the time

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
washed my memory

for not paying sound overwhelmed
the resemblance

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
I assumed that they were divisible
