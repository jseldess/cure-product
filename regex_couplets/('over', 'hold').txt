('over', 'hold')

I step over the edge
I take hold of my finger

hovering above standing water
Since I had to hold the entire company

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
and hold and wish to hold

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
designed to hold up my underwear
