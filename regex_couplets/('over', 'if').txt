('over', 'if')

I step over the edge
drifting does not feel an exception

over the long time up in the sky
drifting away

over the time line I was on
if you have providence to excess

hovering above standing water
learned without too much difficulty to code

oddly grown over with historic bark
That company creates a life

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
If I take a different measure

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
if there is anything

if that has anything

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
