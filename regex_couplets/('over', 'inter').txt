('over', 'inter')

I step over the edge
way high up in the inter

over the long time up in the sky
higher up in the internet

over the time line I was on
hold at intervals riding forward

hovering above standing water
high up in the internet

over the long line up in the sky
with internally regulated climate

oddly grown over with historic bark
Then I saw them interview

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
my interfaced stand data

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
