('over', 'just')

I step over the edge
Theyâ€™re just not mine

If I step over the edge
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

over the long time up in the sky
was not just a defeat

hovering above standing water
I just got a letter

oddly grown over with historic bark
it was not just a defeat

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
