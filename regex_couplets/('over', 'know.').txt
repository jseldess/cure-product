('over', 'know.')

I step over the edge
for how can you know without direction

If I step over the edge
I even know what I would find

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
even when close to my knowing

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
knowing the constituents

for not paying sound overwhelmed
who knows the way

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
