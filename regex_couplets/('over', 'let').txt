('over', 'let')

I step over the edge
But I can’t let myself treat 

over the long time up in the sky
I let myself treat

over the time line I was on
It’s the third letter from the end

oddly grown over with historic bark
I let it remind me again

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
