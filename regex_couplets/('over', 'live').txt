('over', 'live')

I step over the edge
Which is a measure to never live out

over the long time up in the sky
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

hovering above standing water
Which is a pleasure to never live out

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
where I send and relive aside

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
where I send and relive would be held

for not paying sound overwhelmed
where I send and relive

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
