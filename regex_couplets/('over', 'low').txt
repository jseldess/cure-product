('over', 'low')

I step over the edge
slow asynchronous

over the long time up in the sky
to the pillow

over the time line I was on
low in the content architecture

hovering above standing water
I am not allowed to see their face

oddly grown over with historic bark
under pillowing a cloud

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
