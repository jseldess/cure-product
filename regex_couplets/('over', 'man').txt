('over', 'man')

I step over the edge
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

over the long time up in the sky
There are performance reviews

over the time line I was on
not many face up

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
They have very many choices

for not paying sound overwhelmed
and that man comes on to tell me 

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
