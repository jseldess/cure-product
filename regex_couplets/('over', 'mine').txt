('over', 'mine')

I step over the edge
Theyâ€™re just not mine

If I step over the edge
The third letter from the end is mine

oddly grown over with historic bark
The ads in mine

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
To the right of determined elections

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
