('over', 'move')

I step over the edge
since I can imagine movement

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
and literally moved

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
myself moved literally as it is

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
