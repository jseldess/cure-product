('over', 'nights')

I step over the edge
battery dawn nights blending themselves

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
dawn already formerly nights 

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
with dawn already formerly nights 

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
