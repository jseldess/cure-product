('over', 'nor')

I step over the edge
over the long line I would honor

over the time line I was on
nor work in this way daily

hovering above standing water
the simple act of honoring an accountant

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
nor envy honest work

which had on honor to be told

for not paying sound overwhelmed
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
