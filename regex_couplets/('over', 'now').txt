('over', 'now')

I step over the edge
for how can you know without direction

If I step over the edge
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

over the long time up in the sky
out in the snow

over the time line I was on
out in the snow fall

oddly grown over with historic bark
I take it out in the snow fall

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
even when close to my knowing

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
knowing the constituents

for not paying sound overwhelmed
who knows the way

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
