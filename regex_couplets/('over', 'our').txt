('over', 'our')

I step over the edge
You can hear it also through your leisure

over the long time up in the sky
reasons resources

over the time line I was on
Two hours and

hovering above standing water
or an available resource

over the long line up in the sky
with four key value pairs

oddly grown over with historic bark
your bid to the next highest ranked network

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
or alter of course the time anyway

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
Who throws contours away

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
