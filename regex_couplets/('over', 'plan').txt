('over', 'plan')

I step over the edge
and is relentlessly planned

over the long time up in the sky
The planning process for visions

oddly grown over with historic bark
The planning process is for visionaries only

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
and for which the plan agreed

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
