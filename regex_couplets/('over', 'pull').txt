('over', 'pull')

I step over the edge
I’ll pull myself another personality type

over the long time up in the sky
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

over the time line I was on
fish pulled out of the lake

hovering above standing water
I’ll pull myself higher up

over the long line up in the sky
