('over', 'purposes')

I step over the edge
I tell you my purposes

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Where I host my purposes

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
elsewhere my purposes

for not paying sound overwhelmed
the impulse for my own purposes

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
