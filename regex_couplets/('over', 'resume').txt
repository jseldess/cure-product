('over', 'resume')

I step over the edge
and can’t presume to need

over the long time up in the sky
Then I can’t presume to need others

over the time line I was on
I resume unassimilable visions

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I resume attributable visions

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I presume to others

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
