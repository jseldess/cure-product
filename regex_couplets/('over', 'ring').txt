('over', 'ring')

I step over the edge
bring your child along

over the long time up in the sky
ring

over the time line I was on
hovering above standing water

over the long line up in the sky
actually considering the end

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
storing in surfeit

firing and connecting somewhere

for not paying sound overwhelmed
The prospect for veering healthily

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
Or can have seen offering possession
