('over', 'set')

I step over the edge
upset by Gingrich

hovering above standing water
in front of the set afternoon

oddly grown over with historic bark
in front of the set of regulations

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
Um, upset by Gingrich
