('over', 'side')

I step over the edge
aside from the retinas

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
But my not feeling the memory aside

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

for not paying sound overwhelmed
by the side of the hosting service

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
