('over', 'space')

I step over the edge
into rotating and directionless space

If I step over the edge
into directionless space

over the long time up in the sky
in the space that it had

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
though we are breaking in the space that it had

for not paying sound overwhelmed
in the fill space 

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
