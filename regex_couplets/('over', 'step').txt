('over', 'step')

I step over the edge
If I step on the edge

If I step over the edge
What the next step

oddly grown over with historic bark
Whatâ€™s the next step

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
step in by the prospect

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
stepping off into the middle
