('over', 'talk')

I step over the edge
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

oddly grown over with historic bark
talking into pheasants bending themselves

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
talking into percents bending themselves

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
