('over', 'tell')

I step over the edge
Then I constellate my time family country

over the long time up in the sky
So I constellate the time family country

over the time line I was on
I constellate the time

hovering above standing water
I had to tell them the news

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I tell you my purposes

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
and that man comes on to tell me 

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
