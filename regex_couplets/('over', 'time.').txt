('over', 'time.')

I step over the edge
where I sleep at times

over the long time up in the sky
Then I constellate my time family country

over the time line I was on
So I constellate the time family country

hovering above standing water
On the timeline I was on

over the long line up in the sky
over the long time I was on

oddly grown over with historic bark
The long time I had a vision

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
The long time I was a vision

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
or alter of course the time anyway

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
until a happier time found

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
