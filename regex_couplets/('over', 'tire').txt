('over', 'tire')

I step over the edge
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
for to tire as far back as my history

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
