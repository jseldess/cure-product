('over', 'trying')

I step over the edge
when trying to feel the extension of key values

oddly grown over with historic bark
that I hear without trying

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
wearing trying talking into it

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I spun around trying to touch the spots
