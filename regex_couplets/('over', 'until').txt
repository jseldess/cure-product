('over', 'until')

I step over the edge
until my purpose up in the sky

over the time line I was on
until I could not tire 

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
until I could not be tired

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
until I purpose up in the sky

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
until a happier time found

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
