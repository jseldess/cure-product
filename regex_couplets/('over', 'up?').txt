('over', 'up?')

I step over the edge
though there are quarters with goals

If I step over the edge
slow asynchronous

over the long time up in the sky
I’ll get there eventually

over the time line I was on
by no ventillation my purpose

over the long line up in the sky
over the long line I would honor

hovering above standing water
high up in the architecture

over the long time I was on
until my purpose up in the sky

oddly grown over with historic bark
your bid to the next highest ranked network

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I walk up and don’t work anymore

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
black spots on a white surface

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
I thought

for not paying sound overwhelmed
ground for not paying

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
I assumed that they were divisible
