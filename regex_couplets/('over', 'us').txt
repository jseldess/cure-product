('over', 'us')

I step over the edge
Theyâ€™re just not mine

If I step over the edge
slow asynchronous

over the long time up in the sky
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

over the time line I was on
I want to cite a poem so usual

hovering above standing water
The ventillation rushes on

oddly grown over with historic bark
So stay with us

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
it was not just a defeat

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

for not paying sound overwhelmed
useless for not having paid

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
