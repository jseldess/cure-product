('over', 'use')

I step over the edge
You use the most essential parts

hovering above standing water
I reuse unassimilable visions

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I used my technology

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
trackers collecting data on users

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
The trackers on users

for not paying sound overwhelmed
useless for not having paid

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
