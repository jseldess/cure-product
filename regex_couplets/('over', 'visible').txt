('over', 'visible')

I step over the edge
Iâ€™ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

over the long time up in the sky
And make myself a visible

over the time line I was on
Divisible or

hovering above standing water
I assume the offers divisible

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
I assumed that they were divisible
