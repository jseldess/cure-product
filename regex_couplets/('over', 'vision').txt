('over', 'vision')

I step over the edge
I had me a vision

over the long time up in the sky
The planning process for visions

oddly grown over with historic bark
The planning process is for visionaries only

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
The long time I had a vision

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
there wasnâ€™t any television 

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
joined in my television

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
