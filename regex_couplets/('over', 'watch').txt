('over', 'watch')

I step over the edge
when watching tv

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
in the sense of watching

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I watch a movie

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
When I'm watching my tv 

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
