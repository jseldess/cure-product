('over', 'will')

I step over the edge
will not be the same

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
that will spur me on

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
would only willingly break

for not paying sound overwhelmed
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
