('over', 'work')

I step over the edge
nor work in this way daily

hovering above standing water
Having transitioned from leisure to work

oddly grown over with historic bark
your bid to the next highest ranked network

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
nor envy honest work
