('over', 'you.')

I step over the edge
for how can you know without direction

If I step over the edge
You can hear it also through your leisure

over the long time up in the sky
if you have providence to excess

hovering above standing water
That you can see only the back of

oddly grown over with historic bark
your bid to the next highest ranked network

over the roof of the buildings across the alley
If you have confidence regardless all else

over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
I tell you my purposes

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
the young ripples inaudibly

over the hooves and buildings across the alley
