('own', 'And')

in a sharp downward turn 
And put in place as though stationary

Being grown
And as an extension of the values

to the down arrow
And make myself a visible

I brought my head down
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
And for an ungraspable time

One was up where it should be down
And we could inhabit the room easy

the impulse for my own prospects
