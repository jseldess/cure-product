('own', 'As')

in a sharp downward turn 
As though stationary and a destination

Being grown
Assimilable or

I brought my head down
Aspirational strategy

oddly grown over with historic bark
As an extension of the values

even when close to my owning
As a clone, illegally conceived

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
