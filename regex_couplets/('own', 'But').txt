('own', 'but')

in a sharp downward turn 
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

In a sharp downard turn
but not impart cynicism

Being grown
Attributable or

I brought my head down
but the sun isn’t up

oddly grown over with historic bark
but it continued

even when close to my owning
I resume attributable visions

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
that decisions can be attributable

own stays brought loyal
but for memory elsewhere

for my own purposes
decisions that can be attributable

own best form
revisions that can be attributable

All that I own messageable
but I own all that’s messageable
