('own', 'For')

in a sharp downward turn 
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Being grown
Forecasting the story before dawn

oddly grown over with historic bark
For an ungraspable time

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
For Mitt Romney

the impulse for my own prospects
For my own purchases

the impulse my own prospects
Formerly a way like this one

own stays brought loyal
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

All that I own messageable
