in a sharp downward turn 
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

In a sharp downard turn
I’m simply inside

Being grown
Right now I’m the cart

to the down arrow
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

oddly grown over with historic bark
where I’m watching my tv

for my own purposes
