('own', 'if')

in a sharp downward turn 
drifting away

In a sharp downard turn
if not directly on my skin

Being grown
What does it mean to drift

to the down arrow
drifting away from the task

sudden downward turn
if you have providence to excess

I brought my head down
out of the fifth page ruins

oddly grown over with historic bark
That company creates a life

even when close to my owning
If I take some different measure

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
if there is anything 

the impulse for my own prospects
if that has anything

own stays brought loyal
if only on the way to the trash

All that I own messageable
