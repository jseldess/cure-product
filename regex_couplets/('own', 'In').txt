('own', 'IN')

in a sharp downward turn 
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

I brought my head down
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

oddly grown over with historic bark
ASPIRATING VISIONS

even when close to my owning
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
By NATASHA SINGER

for my own purchases
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

own stays brought loyal
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

in need one in that best own
