('own', 'Is')

in a sharp downward turn 
Why isnâ€™t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

In a sharp downard turn
Is the weight of my purchases

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
Is the weight of my click or zipcode

the impulse for my own prospects
Is there a baby and a bear

own stays brought loyal
