('own', 'My')

in a sharp downward turn 
My associations

even when close to my owning
My purpose up in the sky

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
My means without gravity

the impulse for my own prospects
My daughter with her way

own stays brought loyal
My say to the elections

for my own purposes
My state kept loaned impression

my reflexing indented in my own tongue
My void

into an own
