('own', 'so')

in a sharp downward turn 
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

In a sharp downard turn
When I want something

Being grown
who are so fresh and agile

to the down arrow
I’ll pull myself another personality type

I brought my head down
A person from a distance

which I brought down with qualities
or an available resource

oddly grown over with historic bark
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

even when close to my owning
If I take some different measure

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
so that nothing had gravity

the impulse for my own prospects
sound inundated for my own purchases

All parties would be held for my own purchases
and sound redundant

for my own purchases
firing and connecting somewhere

own stays brought loyal
so still watch them

in need one in that best own
by in the sound privacy

own that stays brought loyal
by in the sounded privacy

the impulse my own prospects
also didn’t really move

for my own purposes
buy in the sound privacy

own best form
and could be inflected with reasons

own best form to ourselves
sizes track for asking sound

All that I own messageable
