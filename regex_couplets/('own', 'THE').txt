('own', 'THE')

in a sharp downward turn 
THE SNOW

to the down arrow
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

I brought my head down
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

oddly grown over with historic bark
THE OFFERS

even when close to my owning
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
