('own', 'That')

in a sharp downward turn 
That’s exaclty what I want for them

Being grown
That’s where I sleep at times

the down arrow
That’s when they really take

which I brought down with qualities
That you can see only the back of

oddly grown over with historic bark
That company creates a life

even when close to my owning
That I captured an afterimage

the impulse for my own prospects
That are my right to say

for my own purposes
