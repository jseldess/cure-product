('own', 'There')

in a sharp downward turn 
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Being grown
There are quarterly goals

to the down arrow
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I brought my head down
There was very little physical activity

even when close to my owning
There are spots waiting

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
There are constant ways

own stays brought loyal
