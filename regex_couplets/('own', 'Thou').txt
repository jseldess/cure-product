('own', 'Thou')

in a sharp downward turn 
Though there are quarters goals

Being grown
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

even when close to my owning
Though we are waiting for her

the impulse for my own prospects
Though we are breaking 

For my own purchases
Though we are waiting 

own stays brought loyal
Though we can’t help waiting

in need one in that best own
