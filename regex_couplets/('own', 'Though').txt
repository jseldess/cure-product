('own', 'though')

in a sharp downward turn 
As though stationary and a destination

Being grown
though it was most emphatically that

I brought my head down
I had nightmares though

even when close to my owning
I thought

the impulse for my own prospects
though we are still breaking in

for my own purchases
though we are breaking in the space that it had

found dated for my own purchases
after though thereâ€™s no memory

own stays brought loyal
though we are waiting for her

in need one in that best own
I answered what I thought

for my own purposes
