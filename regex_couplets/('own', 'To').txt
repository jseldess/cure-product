('own', 'To')

in a sharp downward turn 
To my children Walt Whitman

Being grown
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

I brought my head down
To that impossible place

oddly grown over with historic bark
Tomorrow

even when close to my owning
To neither study

the impulse for my own prospects
To the ends of transactions

own stays brought loyal
To the ends of my transactions

in need one in that best own
To the right of determined elections

for my own purposes
