('own', 'Where')

in a sharp downward turn 
Where official policy is to catch and release

I brought my qualities down
Where I put it beating

which I brought down with qualities
Where I take my liesure

even when close to my owning
Where I lead gravity

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
Where I need gravity

One was up where it should be down
Where in me did I host

the impulse for my own prospects
Where I host my purposes

for my own purchases
Where in me did I last

the impulse my own prospects
Where in me did I lose

own stays brought loyal
