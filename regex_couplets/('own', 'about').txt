('own', 'about')

in a sharp downward turn 
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

In a sharp downard turn
about my childrenâ€™s consumption

It keeps coming down thankfully
burrowed about from repeated travels

own stays brought loyal
and literally moved about

in need one in that best own
I answered about

for my own purchases
which I feel formerly about for

the impulse my own prospects
answered about 

for my own purposes
