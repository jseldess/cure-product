('own', 'across')

in a sharp downward turn 
Before we walk across the wide field

In a sharp downard turn
Before we walk across the wide opening

It keeps coming down thankfully
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Being grown
across the retinas

even when close to my owning
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

the impulse for my own prospects
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
