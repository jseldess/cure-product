('own', 'act')

in a sharp downward turn 
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

In a sharp downard turn
In the retroactive light

It keeps coming down thankfully
In the light of retroactive conversations

Being grown
I was enjoined to act again myself

to the down arrow
I was enjoined to act again

oddly grown over with historic bark
Not goals or tactics

even when close to my owning
we had inhabited actually

the impulse for my own prospects
The ends of my transactions

for my own purchases
to the ends of my transactions

own stays brought loyal
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

in need one in that best own
to the ends of actions

own that stays brought loyal
I turn not sad exactly

for my own purposes
I return not sad exactly

state reflexing indented in my own
before I act on them

own best form to ourselves
