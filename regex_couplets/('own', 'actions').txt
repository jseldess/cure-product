('own', 'actions')

in a sharp downward turn 
conversations with our reactions

Being grown
to the ends of my transactions

the impulse for my own prospects
The ends of my transactions

for my own purchases
To the ends of transactions

own stays brought loyal
to the ends of actions

in need one in that best own
