('own', 'again')

in a sharp downward turn 
at any time it can drift again

Being grown
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

to the down arrow
I keep turning back again myself

I brought my head down
a similar desire against me

which I brought down with qualities
I was enjoined to act again

oddly grown over with historic bark
I was enjoined to act again myself

even when close to my owning
I let it remind me again

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
