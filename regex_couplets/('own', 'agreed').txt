('own', 'agreed')

in a sharp downward turn 
and to which I’ve agreed

the impulse for my own prospects
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

found dated for my own purchases
and for which the plan agreed

own stays brought loyal
and to which the plan agreed

in need one in that best own
that agreed one of rest

own that stays brought loyal
that agreed home

own best form
that agreed to one the people

own best form to ourselves
that agreed one best

the people in own form
that agreed home to people

own stays bought loyal
