('own', 'All')

in a sharp downward turn 
All of the time

Being grown
All that I can think I want

even when close to my owning
All parties would be held for my own purchases

for my own purchases
All parties would be held

the impulse my own prospects
All that I own messageable

but I own all thatâ€™s messageable
