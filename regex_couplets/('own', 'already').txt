('own', 'already')

in a sharp downward turn 
already formerly a long time

the impulse for my own prospects
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

found dated for my own purchases
already formely a long time

For my own purchases
with dawn already formerly nights 

own stays brought loyal
dawn already formerly nights 

in need one in that best own
So I presume the offers already

own best form to ourselves
The prospects there already

All that I own messageable
