('own', 'answered')

in a sharp downward turn 
answered about 

own stays brought loyal
by the sight of the hosting answered about

in need one in that best own
I answered what I thought

own that stays brought loyal
I answered about

for my own purchases
I answered while interfaced

for my own purposes
