('own', 'any')

in a sharp downward turn 
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

In a sharp downard turn
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Being grown
at any time it can drift again

to the down arrow
Or the company

which I brought down with qualities
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

even when close to my owning
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
without any further damage

the impulse for my own prospects
They have very many choices

for my own purchases
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

own stays brought loyal
if there is anything 

in need one in that best own
The many transparent pixel calls

own that stays brought loyal
or imagined anyway

for my own purposes
