('own', 'are')

in a sharp downward turn 
Though there are quarters goals

Being grown
who are so fresh and agile

to the down arrow
barely outlines

oddly grown over with historic bark
They are called aspirational

even when close to my owning
There are spots waiting

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
Though we are waiting for her

the impulse for my own prospects
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

for my own purchases
though we are breaking in the space that it had

found dated for my own purchases
Though we are breaking 

the impulse my own prospects
Though we are waiting 

own stays brought loyal
still carefully

in need one in that best own
There are constant ways

own that stays brought loyal
That are my right to say

for my own purposes
careening between the preambles
