('own', 'around')

in a sharp downward turn 
Spinning around the heart

which I brought down with qualities
around my country 

even when close to my owning
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
More reasons around my country 

the impulse for my own prospects
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

for my own purchases
and around redundant

own stays brought loyal
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

in need one in that best own
