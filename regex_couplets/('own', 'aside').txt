('own', 'aside')

in a sharp downward turn 
aside from the retinas

even when close to my owning
But my not feeling the memory aside

the impulse for my own prospects
where I send and retrieve aside

the impulse for my own purposes
where I stand aside

for my own purchases
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

sound inundated for my own purchases
where I send and relive aside

the impulse my own prospects
aside the impulse to my purpose

own stays brought loyal
where I stand aside and retrieve

for my own purposes
