('own', 'at')

in a sharp downward turn 
where I sleep at times

In a sharp downard turn
and not falling at all

It keeps coming down thankfully
In the light of retroactive conversations

Being grown
What does it mean to drift

to the down arrow
That’s where I sleep at times

the down arrow
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I brought my head down
and my heart rate

I brought my qualities down
Where official policy is to catch and release

which I brought down with qualities
That’s when they really take

I put my bread down
path

I brought my count down
To that impossible place

oddly grown over with historic bark
What’s the next step

even when close to my owning
I watch a movie

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I watch a moving afterimage

the impulse for my own prospects
trackers collecting data on users

for my own purchases
though we are breaking in the space that it had

found dated for my own purchases
sound inundated for my own purchases

All parties would be held for my own purchases
and found inundated

the impulse my own prospects
I designated 

and drowned inundated
where I am aside at least

own stays brought loyal
in need one in that best own

own that stays brought loyal
that in need one best own

need one in best own
that stays brought loyal

impulse for my own purchases
for the duration of the answer

for my own purposes
to return what I bought

state reflexing indented in my own
state kept moaned impression

my reflexing indented in my own tongue
in my state

reflexing indented in my own
state indented in my own

into an own
state kept owned impression

indented in my own
We ask say in that case

own best form
decisions that can be attributable

own best form to ourselves
that agreed one best

the people in own form
that agreed home to people

own stays bought loyal
speech that is of by prospects

All that I own messageable
but I own all that’s messageable
