('own', 'bill')

in a sharp downward turn 
I hear it between bills and stuff

oddly grown over with historic bark
I can hear it between bills and stuff

even when close to my owning
until the bill came

the impulse for my own prospects
the bill my detuning 

for my own purposes
between bills and stuffed animals

own best form
bills and stuffed animals

All that I own messageable
