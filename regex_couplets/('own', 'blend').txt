('own', 'blend')

in a sharp downward turn 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

In a sharp downard turn
walking into percents blending themselves

even when close to my owning
where I blend and relive

own stays brought loyal
where lights blended themselves

in need one in that best own
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

for my own purposes
