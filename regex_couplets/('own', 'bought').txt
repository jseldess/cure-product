('own', 'bought')

in a sharp downward turn 
bought in the sounded privacy

own stays brought loyal
bought in the surrounded privacy 

for my own purchases
to return what I bought

for my own purposes
own stays bought loyal

the people in own form
bought stays own loyal

in need one in that best own
