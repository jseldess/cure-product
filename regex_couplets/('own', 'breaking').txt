('own', 'breaking')

in a sharp downward turn 
though we are still breaking in

for my own purchases
though we are breaking in the space that it had

found dated for my own purchases
Though we are breaking 

the impulse my own prospects
without really breaking

and drowned inundated
breaking from my constituents

the impulse for my own prospects
