('own', 'brought')

in a sharp downward turn 
I brought my head down

I brought my qualities down
which I brought down with qualities

I put my bread down
I brought my count down

I put my head down
own stays brought loyal

in need one in that best own
own that stays brought loyal

need one in best own
that stays brought loyal

that in need one best own
at home brought into privacy

own best form to ourselves
home stays brought loyal

the people in own form
brought messageable to you

All that I own messageable
