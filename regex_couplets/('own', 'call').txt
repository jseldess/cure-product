('own', 'call')

in a sharp downward turn 
not calling or echoing for once

In a sharp downard turn
though it was most emphatically that

I brought my head down
They are called aspirational

even when close to my owning
Which can be called confidence

the impulse for my own prospects
to take the call

own stays brought loyal
The many transparent pixel calls

in need one in that best own
recalling aside

for my own purposes
