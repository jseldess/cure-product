('own', 'came')

in a sharp downward turn 
I invited most of what came next

even when close to my owning
I came back to me

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
until the bill came

the impulse for my own prospects
and came home to rewind inflections

own best form to ourselves
and came home to rewind
