('own', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

in a sharp downward turn 
I can’t fix them without direction

Being grown
Then I can’t presume to need others

to the down arrow
But I can’t let myself treat 

I brought my head down
That can’t be glimpsed

oddly grown over with historic bark
Though we can’t help waiting

own stays brought loyal
I can’t remember them

state reflexing indented in my own
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
