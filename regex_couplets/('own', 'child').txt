('own', 'child')

in a sharp downward turn 
On a snow day with my children

In a sharp downard turn
about my childrenâ€™s consumption

It keeps coming down thankfully
especially in a child

Being grown
bring your child along

to the down arrow
even my child

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
my possession of my children

own stays brought loyal
speech my possession of my children

in need one in that best own
