('own', 'code')

in a sharp downward turn 
as long as I have access to the code

Being grown
May I have your zip code

I brought my head down
I spend time online learning to code

which I brought down with qualities
learned without too much difficulty to code

oddly grown over with historic bark
falling off the encoded end

even when close to my owning
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

One was up where it should be down
Is the weight of my click or zipcode

the impulse for my own prospects
zipcode

own stays brought loyal
