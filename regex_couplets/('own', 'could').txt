('own', 'could')

in a sharp downward turn 
and could be mapped and weighed

which I brought down with qualities
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

I brought my head down
until I could not tire 

even when close to my owning
I could consume the dream

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I could in effect credit

the impulse for my own prospects
and could be inflected with reasons

own best form to ourselves
