('own', 'count')

in a sharp downward turn 
Then I constellate my time family country

Being grown
So I constellate the time family country

I brought my head down
I brought my count down

I put my head down
without the long time I was accounting

even when close to my owning
More reasons around my country 

the impulse for my own prospects
