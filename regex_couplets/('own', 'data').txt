('own', 'data')

in a sharp downward turn 
I’ll pull my data higher up

I brought my head down
I’ll pull my data

oddly grown over with historic bark
The days of private data

even when close to my owning
trackers collecting data on users

for my own purchases
my interfaced stand data

for my own purposes
