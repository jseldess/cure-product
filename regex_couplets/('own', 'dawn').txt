('own', 'dawn')

in a sharp downward turn 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

In a sharp downard turn
Forecasting the story before dawn

oddly grown over with historic bark
dawn already formerly nights 

the impulse for my own prospects
dawn formerly

own stays brought loyal
battery dawn nights 

in need one in that best own
battery dawn nights ending themselves

for my own purposes
