('own', 'day')

in a sharp downward turn 
On a snow day with my children

In a sharp downard turn
One day there is direction

Being grown
I argued the days felt longer

oddly grown over with historic bark
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

even when close to my owning
The day

the impulse for my own prospects
at least most days

for my own purposes
