('own', 'desire')

in a sharp downward turn 
others desires

Being grown
If I let myself see others desires

to the down arrow
Others desires as legitimate

I brought my head down
my desires were open

which I brought down with qualities
I wish my desires were open

I brought my qualities down
a similar desire against me

I put my bread down
