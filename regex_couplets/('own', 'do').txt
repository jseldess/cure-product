('own', 'do')

in a sharp downward turn 
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

In a sharp downard turn
It keeps coming down thankfully

Being grown
What does it mean to drift

to the down arrow
the down arrow

sudden downward turn
The dogs and lillies

I brought my head down
I brought my qualities down

which I brought down with qualities
I put my bread down

I brought my count down
I put my head down

oddly grown over with historic bark
What I do in my liesure

even when close to my owning
here is the site of the battle of maldon

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
One was up where it should be down

the impulse for my own prospects
and it doesn’t take long

own stays brought loyal
latency which doesn’t mean anything

in need one in that best own
I only think I don’t listen

All that I own messageable
