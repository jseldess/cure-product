('own', 'does')

in a sharp downward turn 
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

In a sharp downard turn
does not feel an exception

Being grown
What does it mean to drift

to the down arrow
and it doesn’t take long

own stays brought loyal
latency which doesn’t mean anything

in need one in that best own
