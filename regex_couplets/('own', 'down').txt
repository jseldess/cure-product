('own', 'down')

in a sharp downward turn 
In a sharp downard turn

It keeps coming down thankfully
to the down arrow

the down arrow
sudden downward turn

I brought my head down
I brought my qualities down

which I brought down with qualities
I put my bread down

I brought my count down
I put my head down

oddly grown over with historic bark
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

One was up where it should be down
