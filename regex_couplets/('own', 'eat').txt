('own', 'eat')

in a sharp downward turn 
too sunny to eat ice cream

In a sharp downard turn
I reach repeated expressions first

It keeps coming down thankfully
I propogated repeated expressions first

Being grown
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

to the down arrow
I let myself treat

I brought my head down
Where I put it beating

which I brought down with qualities
executive breath

oddly grown over with historic bark
of the habits they create.

even when close to my owning
And from that great distance

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
was not just a defeat

the impulse for my own prospects
for the creation of the universe

own stays brought loyal
burrowed about from repeated travels

for my own purposes
