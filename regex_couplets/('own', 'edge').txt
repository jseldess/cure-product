('own', 'edge')

in a sharp downward turn 
I step off the edge

In a sharp downard turn
Face falling off the edge of the face

It keeps coming down thankfully
The edge is put in place

Being grown
off the edge of the world

to the down arrow
value falling off the edge of the face

I brought my head down
Falling off the edge of the face

oddly grown over with historic bark
