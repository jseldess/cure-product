('own', 'else')

in a sharp downward turn 
If you have confidence regardless all else

I brought my head down
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
and elsewhere my memory

the impulse for my own prospects
elsewhere my purposes

for my own purchases
elsewhere by my memory

own stays brought loyal
By my memory elsewhere

the impulse my own prospects
in memory elsewhere

for my own purposes
