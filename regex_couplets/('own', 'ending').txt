('own', 'ending')

in a sharp downward turn 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

In a sharp downard turn
I tried to feel the key values extending 

oddly grown over with historic bark
talking into pheasants bending themselves

even when close to my owning
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

own stays brought loyal
battery dawn nights ending themselves

for my own purposes
