('own', 'enter')

in a sharp downward turn 
I have entered my phone

In a sharp downard turn
The sun high enough to enter directly 

even when close to my owning
I have entered my purposes

the impulse for my own prospects
I have entered my purchases

for my own purchases
I had entered my phone

for my own purposes
