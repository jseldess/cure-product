('own', 'fall')

in a sharp downward turn 
Then fall then summer from my face

In a sharp downard turn
and not falling at all

It keeps coming down thankfully
Then fall then summer

Being grown
Face falling off the edge of the face

to the down arrow
value falling off the edge of the face

I brought my head down
The value falling off the edge of th face

oddly grown over with historic bark
falling off the encoded end

even when close to my owning
