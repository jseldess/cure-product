('own', 'feel')

in a sharp downward turn 
conversations with our feelings

Being grown
I tried to feel the key values extending 

oddly grown over with historic bark
I tried to feel the extension of key values

even when close to my owning
But my not feeling the memory aside

the impulse for my own prospects
But my not feeling the memory inside

for my own purchases
which feels most comfortable

own stays brought loyal
which feels more comfortable

in need one in that best own
By my feeling the memory inside

own that stays brought loyal
which I feel formerly about for

the impulse my own prospects
But my feeling the memory aside

for my own purposes
