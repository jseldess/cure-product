('own', 'feeling')

in a sharp downward turn 
conversations with our feelings

Being grown
But my not feeling the memory aside

the impulse for my own prospects
But my not feeling the memory inside

for my own purchases
By my feeling the memory inside

own stays brought loyal
But my feeling the memory aside

for my own purposes
