('own', 'form')

in a sharp downward turn 
There are performance reviews

to the down arrow
Toward the start informally given my reasons

even when close to my owning
already formerly a long time

the impulse for my own prospects
A way formerly like this one

for my own purchases
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

found dated for my own purchases
already formely a long time

the impulse my own prospects
dawn formerly

own stays brought loyal
in the form filled offered in trust

in need one in that best own
formerly a way

own that stays brought loyal
which I feel formerly about for

impulse for my own purchases
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

for my own purposes
own best form

own best form to ourselves
the people in home form

the people in own form
form to more ourselves

the people in form own
home rest form to ourselves 

own stays bought loyal
