('own', 'from')

in a sharp downward turn 
Then fall then summer from my face

In a sharp downard turn
Falling from this distance

It keeps coming down thankfully
from the incoming stream

Being grown
Falling from my face

to the down arrow
drifting away from the task

sudden downward turn
A person from a distance

which I brought down with qualities
out from below the fold

oddly grown over with historic bark
aside from the retinas

even when close to my owning
I get from here through there

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
breaking from my constituents

for my own purchases
from no one point

own stays brought loyal
and relive from burrowed travels

for my own purposes
