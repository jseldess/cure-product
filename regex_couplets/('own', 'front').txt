('own', 'front')

in a sharp downward turn 
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Being grown
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

I brought my qualities down
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

oddly grown over with historic bark
in front of the set of regulations

even when close to my owning
And need out in front purchase

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
behind or out front or up above

for my own purposes
