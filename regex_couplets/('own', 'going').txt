('own', 'going')

in a sharp downward turn 
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

In a sharp downard turn
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

even when close to my owning
The way that she is going

for my own purchases
The way that I am going

own stays brought loyal
