('own', 'had')

in a sharp downward turn 
If he had not carried one virtue

I brought my head down
I had me a vision

oddly grown over with historic bark
Since I had to hold the entire company

even when close to my owning
we had to say goodbye

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
that nothing had gravity

the impulse for my own prospects
in the face that I had

for my own purchases
though we are breaking in the space that it had

found dated for my own purchases
in the space that it had

the impulse my own prospects
which had on honor to be told

own stays brought loyal
in the face that it had

in need one in that best own
I had entered my phone

for my own purposes
