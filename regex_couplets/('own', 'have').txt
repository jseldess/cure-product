('own', 'have')

in a sharp downward turn 
I have entered my phone

In a sharp downard turn
before we can have a retroactive

Being grown
if you have providence to excess

I brought my head down
If you have confidence regardless all else

even when close to my owning
I have supporters

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I have a memory between the day

the impulse for my own prospects
I have entered my purposes

for my own purchases
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

own stays brought loyal
I have turned it off

in need one in that best own
I have them lost

for my own purposes
I have them trust in me

state reflexing indented in my own
I have seen more than I can remember
