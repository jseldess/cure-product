('own', 'he')

in a sharp downward turn 
where I sleep at times

In a sharp downard turn
Then fall then summer from my face

It keeps coming down thankfully
Then fall then summer

Being grown
without imparting the cynicism

to the down arrow
That’s where I sleep at times

the down arrow
drifting away from the task

sudden downward turn
The South Carolina primary 

I brought my head down
and my heart rate

I brought my qualities down
Where official policy is to catch and release

which I brought down with qualities
In a continuous theme

I put my bread down
I put my head down

I brought my count down
and could be mapped and weighed

oddly grown over with historic bark
What’s the next step

even when close to my owning
I get from here through there

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
They can be waived

One was up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes

the impulse for my own prospects
where I end

the impulse for my own purposes
the impulse for my own purchases

for my own purchases
all parties would be helped

found dated for my own purchases
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

sound inundated for my own purchases
All parties would be held for my own purchases

the impulse my own prospects
But my not feeling the memory aside

impulse for my own purchases
where I send and retrieve aside

and drowned inundated
The ends of my transactions

own stays brought loyal
speak them of my possessions

in need one in that best own
stopping into the prospect

own that stays brought loyal
by in the sound privacy

for my own purposes
I stay the right of my elections

state reflexing indented in my own
The weight kept moaned impression

my reflexing indented in my own tongue
the tongue and hands

the void kept owned impression
I have them lost

state kept owned impression
buy in the sound privacy

own best form
I can’t remember them

own best form to ourselves
the people in home form

the people in own form
the people in form own

own stays bought loyal
phrase them of our possessions

need one in best own
phrase them of my possessions

All that I own messageable
traffick is there nonetheless
