('own', 'head')

in a sharp downward turn 
Without a head

Being grown
I brought my head down

I brought my qualities down
with my head

which I brought down with qualities
I put my head down

I put my bread down
I log in and search with my head

I brought my count down
into the next level head

even when close to my owning
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

own stays brought loyal
