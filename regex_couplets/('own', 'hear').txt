('own', 'hear')

in a sharp downward turn 
You can hear it also through your leisure

Being grown
and my heart rate

I brought my head down
and my heartrate

which I brought down with qualities
I hear it between bills and stuff

oddly grown over with historic bark
I can hear it between bills and stuff

even when close to my owning
In my heart did I lose trust

own stays brought loyal
