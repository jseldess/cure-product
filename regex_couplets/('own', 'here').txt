('own', 'here')

in a sharp downward turn 
where I sleep at times

In a sharp downard turn
Of course there is a direction

Being grown
I’ll get there eventually

to the down arrow
That’s where I sleep at times

the down arrow
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I brought my head down
Where official policy is to catch and release

I brought my qualities down
Where I put it beating

which I brought down with qualities
I’ll get there ruins

oddly grown over with historic bark
there was no promotion

even when close to my owning
I get from here through there

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
One was up where it should be down

the impulse for my own prospects
where I end

the impulse for my own purposes
where I stand aside

for my own purchases
where I send and relive would be held

found dated for my own purchases
where I stand and relive

sound inundated for my own purchases
where I send and relive aside

the impulse my own prospects
where I send and retrieve aside

and drowned inundated
where I send and relive

impulse for my own purchases
where I stand and retrieve

own stays brought loyal
Where in me did I host

in need one in that best own
Is there a baby and a bear

own that stays brought loyal
By my memory elsewhere

the impulse for my own purchases
where I stand aside and retrieve

for my own purposes
I learned the point where I am

state reflexing indented in my own
where the tongue rippled

the void kept owned impression
The prospects there already

own best form to ourselves
The offers there already

All that I own messageable
traffick is there nonetheless
