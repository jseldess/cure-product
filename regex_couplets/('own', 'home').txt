('own', 'home')

in a sharp downward turn 
promoting from home to a new job

even when close to my owning
that agreed home

own best form
and came home to rewind inflections

own best form to ourselves
home stays brought loyal

own stays brought loyal
that agreed home to people

own stays bought loyal
at home brought into privacy

All that I own messageable
and came home to rewind
