('own', 'indented')

in a sharp downward turn 
reflexing indented in my phone

even when close to my owning
reflexing indented in my moan

state reflexing indented in my own
my reflexing indented in my own tongue

reflexing indented in my own
state indented in my own

into an own
indented into an own

into my own
indented in my own

own best form
