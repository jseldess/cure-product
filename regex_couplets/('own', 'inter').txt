('own', 'inter')

in a sharp downward turn 
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

In a sharp downard turn
interjecting on a day ambition

Being grown
way high up in the inter

I brought my head down
hold at intervals riding forward

which I brought down with qualities
at intervals while riding forward

I brought my qualities down
high up in the internet

oddly grown over with historic bark
with internally regulated climate

even when close to my owning
Then I saw them interview

the impulse for my own prospects
my interfaced stand data

for my own purposes
aligned or not with my interests

state reflexing indented in my own
