('own', 'into')

in a sharp downward turn 
into rotating directionless 

In a sharp downard turn
into the stream of pictures

Being grown
into a brigand and a murderer

I brought my head down
into the well controlled climate

oddly grown over with historic bark
into the next level head

even when close to my owning
Then I saw into you

the impulse for my own prospects
entered into my purposes

for my own purchases
deep into pathways from repeated travels

own stays brought loyal
stopping into the prospect

in need one in that best own
step by into the prospect

own that stays brought loyal
converting sight into a purchase

the impulse my own prospects
into liminal reflexing

into an own
into the mouth

the void kept owned impression
indented into an own

into my own
at home brought into privacy

own best form to ourselves
already brought into privacy

All that I own messageable
stepping off into the middle
