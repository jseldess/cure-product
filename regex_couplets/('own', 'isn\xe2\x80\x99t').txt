in a sharp downward turn 
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

In a sharp downard turn
The sun isn’t up 

It keeps coming down thankfully
The edge isn’t even there

Being grown
Then the sun isn’t available

I brought my head down
Then the sun isn’t up

I brought my qualities down
but the sun isn’t up

oddly grown over with historic bark
