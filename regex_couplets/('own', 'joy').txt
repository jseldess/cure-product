('own', 'joy')

in a sharp downward turn 
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

In a sharp downard turn
I was enjoying acting against myself

even when close to my owning
a futile joyous white sun

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

the impulse for my own prospects
