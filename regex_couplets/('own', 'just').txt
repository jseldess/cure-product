('own', 'just')

in a sharp downward turn 
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Being grown
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

to the down arrow
was not just a defeat

I brought my head down
I just got a letter

oddly grown over with historic bark
it was not just a defeat

even when close to my owning
