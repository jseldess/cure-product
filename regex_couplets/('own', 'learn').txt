('own', 'learn')

in a sharp downward turn 
in light of learning what we see

Being grown
I spend time online learning to code

which I brought down with qualities
learned without too much difficulty to code

oddly grown over with historic bark
decisioned to learn 

own stays brought loyal
decisioned to learn back

in need one in that best own
phase decision for learning

for my own purchases
I learned my location

for my own purposes
for learning by the prospect

All that I own messageable
