('own', 'learning')

in a sharp downward turn 
in light of learning what we see

Being grown
I spend time online learning to code

which I brought down with qualities
Then I am learning to code

oddly grown over with historic bark
phase decision for learning

own stays brought loyal
for learning by the prospect

for my own purchases
a precision for learning

All that I own messageable
