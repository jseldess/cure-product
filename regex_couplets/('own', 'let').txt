('own', 'let')

in a sharp downward turn 
But I can’t let myself treat 

Being grown
I let myself treat

to the down arrow
But I can’t let myself disregard

I brought my head down
It’s the third letter from the end

oddly grown over with historic bark
I let it remind me again

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
