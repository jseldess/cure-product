('own', 'light')

in a sharp downward turn 
variegated reflected light

In a sharp downard turn
In the retroactive light

It keeps coming down thankfully
In the light of retroactive conversations

Being grown
stopped light with validated fields

own stays brought loyal
where lights blended themselves

in need one in that best own
stopped light with validated faces

for my own purchases
