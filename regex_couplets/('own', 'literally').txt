('own', 'literally')

in a sharp downward turn 
and literally moved

the impulse for my own prospects
as it was designed literally

found dated for my own purchases
and literally unproved

For my own purchases
literally unproved 

and drowned inundated
myself moved literally as it is

own stays brought loyal
and literally moved about

in need one in that best own
not literally moved about

the impulse my own prospects
not literally moved

for my own purposes
