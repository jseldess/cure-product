('own', 'log')

in a sharp downward turn 
I logged in

I put my bread down
I log in and search with my head

which I brought down with qualities
I used my technology

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
and other types of tracking technology

the impulse for my own prospects
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

for my own purchases
