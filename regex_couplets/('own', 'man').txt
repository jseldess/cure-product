('own', 'man')

in a sharp downward turn 
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

In a sharp downard turn
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Being grown
Walt Whitman drifted

to the down arrow
not many face up

even when close to my owning
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

the impulse for my own prospects
They have very many choices

for my own purchases
and that man comes on to tell me 

own stays brought loyal
The many transparent pixel calls

in need one in that best own
