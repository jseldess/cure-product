('own', 'me')

in a sharp downward turn 
where I sleep at times

In a sharp downard turn
Then fall then summer from my face

It keeps coming down thankfully
Then fall then summer

Being grown
What does it mean to drift

to the down arrow
That’s where I sleep at times

the down arrow
in a moment of drifting away from the task

sudden downward turn
over the long time up in the sky

I brought my head down
Some disease effecting the tree out front

I brought my qualities down
The CEO tells me to embody values

which I brought down with qualities
In a continuous theme

I put my bread down
and the graph ahead of me

I brought my count down
a similar desire against me

I put my head down
emerging this year from standing water

oddly grown over with historic bark
I had me a vision

even when close to my owning
If I take some different measure

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
And for an ungraspable time

One was up where it should be down
I could consume the dream

the impulse for my own prospects
and elsewhere my memory 

for my own purchases
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

found dated for my own purchases
already formely a long time

the impulse my own prospects
But my not feeling the memory aside

impulse for my own purchases
Elsewhere my memory

and drowned inundated
already formerly a long time

the impulse for my own purposes
dawn formerly

own stays brought loyal
Where in me did I host

in need one in that best own
A way formerly like this one

own that stays brought loyal
By my memory elsewhere

the impulse for my own purchases
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

for my own purposes
which I feel formerly about for

state reflexing indented in my own
I have them trust in me

state kept owned impression
I can’t remember them

own best form
that agreed home

own best form to ourselves
home stays brought loyal

the people in own form
that agreed home to people

own stays bought loyal
I presume the offers

All that I own messageable
but I own all that’s messageable
