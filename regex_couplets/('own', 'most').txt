('own', 'most')

in a sharp downward turn 
though it was most emphatically that

I brought my head down
You use the most essential parts

which I brought down with qualities
I invited most of what came next

even when close to my owning
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

for my own purchases
which feels most comfortable

own stays brought loyal
most comfortable

in need one in that best own
mostly along cables

for my own purposes
