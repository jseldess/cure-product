('own', 'myself')

in a sharp downward turn 
But I can’t let myself treat 

Being grown
I’ll pull myself another personality type

to the down arrow
I let myself treat

I brought my head down
I keep turning back again myself

I brought my qualities down
I was enjoined to act again myself

oddly grown over with historic bark
off the end myself

even when close to my owning
myself

own stays brought loyal
the least productive of myself

for my own purposes
So I find myself at home

own best form to ourselves
So I found myself at home

All that I own messageable
