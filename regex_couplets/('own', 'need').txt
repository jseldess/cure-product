('own', 'need')

in a sharp downward turn 
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Being grown
drifting away needs

to the down arrow
I need the work

even when close to my owning
And need out in front purchase

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I tell you where I need gravity

One was up where it should be down
not needing to wait

own stays brought loyal
in need one in that best own

own that stays brought loyal
need one in best own

that in need one best own
without really needing

for my own purchases
