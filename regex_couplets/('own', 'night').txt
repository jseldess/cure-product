('own', 'night')

in a sharp downward turn 
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

In a sharp downard turn
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

to the down arrow
blue and sun again a second, then night

oddly grown over with historic bark
I had nightmares though

even when close to my owning
dawn already formerly nights 

the impulse for my own prospects
last night

own stays brought loyal
battery dawn nights blending themselves

in need one in that best own
battery dawn nights 

own that stays brought loyal
battery dawn nights ending themselves

for my own purposes
