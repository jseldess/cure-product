('own', 'no')

in a sharp downward turn 
asynchronous 

In a sharp downard turn
and not falling at all

It keeps coming down thankfully
on a snow day with my children

Being grown
the drifting is not something special

to the down arrow
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I brought my head down
Then I cannot see face value

I brought my qualities down
in a continuous vertiginous dream

which I brought down with qualities
not back in the results

I put my bread down
there was no promotion

oddly grown over with historic bark
and strategies not tactics

even when close to my owning
even when close to my knowing

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
that nothing had gravity

the impulse for my own prospects
and other types of tracking technology

for my own purchases
But my not feeling the memory aside

the impulse my own prospects
But my not feeling the memory inside

impulse for my own purchases
from no one point

own stays brought loyal
and it’s not literal

in need one in that best own
It’s not marshal exactly

own that stays brought loyal
who knows the way

the impulse for my own purposes
not needing to wait

for my own purposes
I return not sad exactly

state reflexing indented in my own
in that I cannot remember 

own best form to ourselves
for a while not to listen

All that I own messageable
traffick is there nonetheless
