('own', 'now')

in a sharp downward turn 
On a snow day with my children

In a sharp downard turn
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

Being grown
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

to the down arrow
out in the snow

I brought my head down
out in the snow fall

oddly grown over with historic bark
I take it out in the snow fall

even when close to my owning
even when close to my knowing

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
knowing the constituents

own stays brought loyal
who knows the way

in need one in that best own
who knows how to turn it off

own that stays brought loyal
that their knowing

state reflexing indented in my own
