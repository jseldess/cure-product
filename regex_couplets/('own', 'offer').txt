('own', 'offer')

in a sharp downward turn 
in the form filled offered in trust

the impulse for my own prospects
in the form filled offered trust

own stays brought loyal
in track as offer asked 

in need one in that best own
I assume the offers reliable

own best form to ourselves
I presume the offers

All that I own messageable
I assume the offers revisitable
