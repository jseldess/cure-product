('own', 'only')

in a sharp downward turn 
only fragments of time with my children

Being grown
only in the case

I brought my head down
So that I notice I am the only one

oddly grown over with historic bark
The planning process is for visionaries only

even when close to my owning
would only willingly break

own stays brought loyal
if only on the way to the trash

All that I own messageable
less only money
