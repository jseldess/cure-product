('own', 'open')

in a sharp downward turn 
Before we walk across the wide opening

In a sharp downard turn
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Being grown
my desires were open

which I brought down with qualities
I wish my desires were open

I brought my head down
The simple act opening surmounted

even when close to my owning
