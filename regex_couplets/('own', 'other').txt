('own', 'other')

in a sharp downward turn 
others desires

Being grown
I’ll pull myself another personality type

to the down arrow
On the other hand

even when close to my owning
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
and other types of tracking technology

the impulse for my own prospects
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

for my own purchases
I presume to others

own stays brought loyal
to the other end

in need one in that best own
Cereal and others’ health

for my own purposes
I assume possession to others
