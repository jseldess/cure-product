('own', 'our')

in a sharp downward turn 
conversations with our purchase

Being grown
bring your child along

to the down arrow
You can hear it also through your leisure

I brought my head down
or an available resource

oddly grown over with historic bark
your bid to the next highest ranked network

even when close to my owning
or alter of course the time anyway

the impulse for my own prospects
Who throws contours away

own stays brought loyal
phrase them of our possessions

own best form
own best form to ourselves

the people in own form
more to ourselves insure

the people in form own
home rest form to ourselves 

own stays bought loyal
form to more ourselves

bought stays own loyal
