('own', 'over')

in a sharp downward turn 
I step over the edge

Being grown
over the long time up in the sky

to the down arrow
over the time line I was on

I brought my head down
hovering above standing water

oddly grown over with historic bark
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

even when close to my owning
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

for my own purchases
for not paying sound overwhelmed

own stays brought loyal
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
