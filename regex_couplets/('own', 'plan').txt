('own', 'plan')

in a sharp downward turn 
and is relentlessly planned

Being grown
The planning process for visions

oddly grown over with historic bark
The planning process is for visionaries only

even when close to my owning
and for which the plan agreed

own stays brought loyal
and to which the plan agreed

in need one in that best own
