('own', 'possession')

in a sharp downward turn 
I speak to them my possessions

own stays brought loyal
speak them of my possessions

in need one in that best own
phrase them of my possessions

own that stays brought loyal
I speak them of my possessions

for my own purchases
I stay the right of my possessions 

for my own purposes
possessions people

state reflexing indented in my own
phrase them of our possessions

own best form
possessions

own best form to ourselves
my possession of my children

All that I own messageable
Or can have seen offering possession
