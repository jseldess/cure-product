('own', 'presume')

in a sharp downward turn 
and can’t presume to need

Being grown
Then I can’t presume to need others

to the down arrow
I continue to presume

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I presume to others

own stays brought loyal
So I presume the offers already

own best form to ourselves
I presume the offers

All that I own messageable
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
