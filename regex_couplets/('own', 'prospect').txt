('own', 'prospect')

in a sharp downward turn 
the impulse for my own prospects

the impulse for my own purposes
the impulse my own prospects

impulse for my own purchases
stopping into the prospect

own stays brought loyal
speech that is of by prospects

in need one in that best own
decisioned by the prospect

for my own purchases
The prospects there already

own best form to ourselves
step in by the prospect

All that I own messageable
The prospect for careening attached
