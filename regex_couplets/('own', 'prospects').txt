('own', 'prospects')

in a sharp downward turn 
the impulse for my own prospects

the impulse for my own purposes
the impulse my own prospects

impulse for my own purchases
speech that is of by prospects

own stays brought loyal
The prospects there already

own best form to ourselves
the prospects being seen by me

All that I own messageable
