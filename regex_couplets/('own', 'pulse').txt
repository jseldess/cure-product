('own', 'pulse')

in a sharp downward turn 
impulse control

which I brought down with qualities
I send and retrieve the impulse

the impulse for my own prospects
the impulse for my own purposes

the impulse for my own purchases
the impulse to my purpose

for my own purchases
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

sound inundated for my own purchases
I stand and retrieve the impulse

the impulse my own prospects
impulse for my own purchases

and drowned inundated
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

own stays brought loyal
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

in need one in that best own
aside the impulse to my purpose

for my own purposes
