('own', 'purchase')

in a sharp downward turn 
conversations with our purchase

Being grown
in traversing my purchase

even when close to my owning
purchased out

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purchases

One was up where it should be down
Is the weight of my purchases

the impulse for my own prospects
the impulse for my own purchases

for my own purchases
found dated for my own purchases

sound inundated for my own purchases
All parties would be held for my own purchases

the impulse my own prospects
impulse for my own purchases

the impulse for my own purposes
converting sight into a purchase

own stays brought loyal
at the site of a purchase

for my own purposes
