('own', 'purpose')

in a sharp downward turn 
by no ventillation my purpose

I brought my head down
until my purpose up in the sky

oddly grown over with historic bark
until I purpose the horizon

even when close to my owning
of my purpose in conversing

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I tell you my purposes

One was up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes

the impulse for my own prospects
the impulse for my own purposes

the impulse for my own purchases
the impulse to my purpose

for my own purchases
aside the impulse to my purpose

own stays brought loyal
to the other end of my purpose

in need one in that best own
for my own purposes

state reflexing indented in my own
