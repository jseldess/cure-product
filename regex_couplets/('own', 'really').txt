('own', 'really')

in a sharp downward turn 
because it was really dark

In a sharp downard turn
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Being grown
When they really take hold of my finger

which I brought down with qualities
That’s when they really take

I brought my head down
without really agreeing

the impulse for my own prospects
without really speaking

found dated for my own purchases
without really breaking

for my own purchases
without really branding 

own stays brought loyal
without really needing

in need one in that best own
also didn’t really move

for my own purposes
