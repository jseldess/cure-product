('own', 'reflexing')

in a sharp downward turn 
reflexing indented in my phone

even when close to my owning
sung reflexing

for my own purposes
reflexing indented in my moan

state reflexing indented in my own
lung reflexing

my reflexing indented in my own tongue
tongue reflexing

reflexing indented in my own
devoid kept moaned reflexing

state indented in my own
into liminal reflexing

into an own
