('own', 'relive')

in a sharp downward turn 
where I send and relive aside

the impulse for my own prospects
where I stand and retrieve relive

for my own purchases
where I send and relive would be held

found dated for my own purchases
where I stand and relive

sound inundated for my own purchases
where I send and relive

the impulse my own prospects
where I send and retrieve relive

own stays brought loyal
and relive from burrowed travels

for my own purposes
