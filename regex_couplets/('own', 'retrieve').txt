('own', 'retrieve')

in a sharp downward turn 
I send and retrieve the impulse

the impulse for my own prospects
where I send and retrieve aside

the impulse for my own purposes
where I stand and retrieve

for my own purchases
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

sound inundated for my own purchases
I stand and retrieve the impulse

the impulse my own prospects
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

impulse for my own purchases
where I stand aside and retrieve

own stays brought loyal
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

in need one in that best own
where I stand and retrieve relive

for my own purposes
