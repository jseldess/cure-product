('own', 'ring')

in a sharp downward turn 
interferring 

Being grown
bring your child along

to the down arrow
ring

I brought my head down
hovering above standing water

oddly grown over with historic bark
actually considering the end

even when close to my owning
storing in surfeit

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
firing and connecting somewhere

own stays brought loyal
The prospect for veering healthily
