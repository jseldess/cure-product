('own', 'say')

in a sharp downward turn 
we had to say goodbye

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I ask say in that case

own stays brought loyal
we ask say in that case

in need one in that best own
I ask say in that phase decisioned

for my own purchases
formerly along my say to the elections

for my own purposes
