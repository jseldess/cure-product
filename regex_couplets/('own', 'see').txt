('own', 'see')

in a sharp downward turn 
Then I cannot see face value

In a sharp downard turn
such as I see

It keeps coming down thankfully
as far as I can see

Being grown
If I let myself see others desires

to the down arrow
where I can claim to see the ruins

oddly grown over with historic bark
under the last seen principle

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

the impulse for my own prospects
Having seen more than 

own stays brought loyal
being seen by me

All that I own messageable
The prospect for seeing healthily
