('own', 'set')

in a sharp downward turn 
upset by Gingrich

I brought my head down
in front of the set afternoon

oddly grown over with historic bark
in front of the set of regulations

even when close to my owning
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

the impulse for my own prospects
presets

own best form
reset

own best form to ourselves
