('own', 'should')

in a sharp downward turn 
While I should be sleeping

I brought my head down
Looking back while I should be sleeping

which I brought down with qualities
While I should sleep not back in the results

I brought my qualities down
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

One was up where it should be down
they should rise up

for my own purchases
the constituents should rise up

and drowned inundated
