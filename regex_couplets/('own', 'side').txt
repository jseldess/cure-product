('own', 'side')

in a sharp downward turn 
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

In a sharp downard turn
I’m simply inside

Being grown
aside from the retinas

even when close to my owning
But my not feeling the memory aside

the impulse for my own prospects
where I send and retrieve aside

the impulse for my own purposes
where I stand aside

for my own purchases
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

sound inundated for my own purchases
where I send and relive aside

the impulse my own prospects
But my not feeling the memory inside

impulse for my own purchases
aside the impulse to my purpose

own stays brought loyal
by the side of the hosting service

in need one in that best own
By my feeling the memory inside

own that stays brought loyal
where I stand aside and retrieve

for my own purposes
