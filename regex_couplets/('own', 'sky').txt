('own', 'sky')

in a sharp downward turn 
over the long time up in the sky

to the down arrow
over the long line up in the sky

I brought my head down
until my purpose up in the sky

oddly grown over with historic bark
though not many facts up in the sky

even when close to my owning
Up in the sky

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
