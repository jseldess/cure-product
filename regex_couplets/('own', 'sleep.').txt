('own', 'sleep.')

in a sharp downward turn 
where I sleep at times

In a sharp downard turn
Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times

the down arrow
Interrupted sleep or

I brought my head down
While I should be sleeping

I brought my qualities down
Looking back while I should be sleeping

which I brought down with qualities
While I should sleep not back in the results

I put my bread down
like flattening sleep 

even when close to my owning
