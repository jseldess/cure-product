('own', 'sound')

in a sharp downward turn 
sound inundated for my own purchases

All parties would be held for my own purchases
and sound redundant

for my own purchases
for not paying sound overwhelmed

own stays brought loyal
by in the sound privacy

in need one in that best own
by in the sounded privacy

the impulse my own prospects
buy in the sound privacy

own best form
sizes track for asking sound

All that I own messageable
