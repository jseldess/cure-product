('own', 'speak')

in a sharp downward turn 
not speaking

for my own purchases
without really speaking

found dated for my own purchases
I speak to them

the impulse my own prospects
would only speak willingly

own stays brought loyal
speak them of my possessions

in need one in that best own
I speak them of my possessions

own that stays brought loyal
