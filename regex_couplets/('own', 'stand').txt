('own', 'stand')

in a sharp downward turn 
hovering above standing water

oddly grown over with historic bark
I stand and retrieve the impulse

the impulse for my own prospects
where I stand aside

for my own purchases
where I stand and relive

sound inundated for my own purchases
I stand and retrieve the impuse

the impulse my own prospects
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

impulse for my own purchases
where I stand and retrieve

own stays brought loyal
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

in need one in that best own
where I stand aside and retrieve

for my own purposes
I learned the point of standing

state reflexing indented in my own
