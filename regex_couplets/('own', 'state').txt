('own', 'state')

in a sharp downward turn 
explicit statements

even when close to my owning
I swayed a little in my state

for my own purposes
in my state

state reflexing indented in my own
state kept moaned impression

my reflexing indented in my own tongue
state indented in my own

into an own
state kept owned impression

indented in my own
