('own', 'stay')

in a sharp downward turn 
wrestling to stay still

Being grown
So stay with us

even when close to my owning
own stays brought loyal

in need one in that best own
own that stays brought loyal

need one in best own
that stays brought loyal

that in need one best own
I stay the right of my elections

for my own purposes
home stays brought loyal

own best form to ourselves
own stays bought loyal

the people in own form
bought stays own loyal

All that I own messageable
