('own', 'stays')

in a sharp downward turn 
own stays brought loyal

in need one in that best own
own that stays brought loyal

need one in best own
that stays brought loyal

that in need one best own
home stays brought loyal

own best form to ourselves
own stays bought loyal

the people in own form
bought stays own loyal

All that I own messageable
