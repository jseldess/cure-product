('own', 'step')

in a sharp downward turn 
I step off the edge

In a sharp downard turn
I step over the edge

Being grown
What the next step

oddly grown over with historic bark
Whatâ€™s the next step

even when close to my owning
step in by the prospect

own stays brought loyal
phase decision step in

for my own purchases
step by into the prospect

All that I own messageable
stepping in the middle
