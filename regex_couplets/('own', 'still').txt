('own', 'still')

in a sharp downward turn 
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

In a sharp downard turn
That is itself not still

Being grown
I love my daughter still

even when close to my owning
though we are still breaking in

for my own purchases
still wash conserving

own stays brought loyal
