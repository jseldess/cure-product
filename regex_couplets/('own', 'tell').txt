('own', 'tell')

in a sharp downward turn 
Then I constellate my time family country

Being grown
So I constellate the time family country

I brought my head down
The CEO tells me to embody values

which I brought down with qualities
I had to tell them the news

even when close to my owning
I tell you my purposes

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes

One was up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purchases

the impulse for my own prospects
and that man comes on to tell me 

own stays brought loyal
