('own', 'their')

in a sharp downward turn 
We can wrestle them with their goals

Being grown
I am not allowed to see their face

oddly grown over with historic bark
that their economic value 

even when close to my owning
without their agreement

own stays brought loyal
to their other end

in need one in that best own
that their knowing

state reflexing indented in my own
