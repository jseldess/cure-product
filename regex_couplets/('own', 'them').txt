('own', 'them')

in a sharp downward turn 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

In a sharp downard turn
That’s exaclty what I want for them

Being grown
In a continuous theme

I put my bread down
or argued for them at least

even when close to my owning
I designed them to hold up my underwear

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
Then I saw them interview

the impulse for my own prospects
I speak to them

for my own purchases
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

own stays brought loyal
speak them of my possessions

in need one in that best own
phrase them of my possessions

own that stays brought loyal
I speak them of my possessions

the impulse my own prospects
battery dawn nights ending themselves

for my own purposes
abjure them with determining 

state reflexing indented in my own
I have them lost

state kept owned impression
phrase them of our possessions

own best form
I can’t remember them

own best form to ourselves
before I act on them
