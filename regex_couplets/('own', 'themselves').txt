('own', 'themselves')

in a sharp downward turn 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

In a sharp downard turn
talking into pheasants bending themselves

even when close to my owning
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

own stays brought loyal
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

in need one in that best own
battery dawn nights ending themselves

for my own purposes
