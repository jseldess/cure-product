('own', 'They')

in a sharp downward turn 
Theyâ€™re just not mine

Being grown
They are called aspirational

even when close to my owning
They can be waived

One was up where it should be down
They can be weighed

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
They have very many choices

for my own purchases
They were filters

for my own purposes
