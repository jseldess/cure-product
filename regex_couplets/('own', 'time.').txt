('own', 'time.')

in a sharp downward turn 
where I sleep at times

In a sharp downard turn
only fragments of time with my children

Being grown
over the long time up in the sky

to the down arrow
Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times

the down arrow
So I constellate the time family country

I brought my head down
I spend time online learning to code

which I brought down with qualities
On the timeline I was on

oddly grown over with historic bark
The long time I had a vision

even when close to my owning
or alter of course the time anyway

the impulse for my own prospects
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

for my own purchases
until a happier time found

own stays brought loyal
formerly a long time they were on

in need one in that best own
formerly along time they were on

own that stays brought loyal
in the long time they were on

for my own purposes
