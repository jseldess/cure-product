('own', 'turn')

in a sharp downward turn 
In a sharp downard turn

It keeps coming down thankfully
sudden downward turn

I brought my head down
I keep turning back again myself

I brought my qualities down
I keep turning back

which I brought down with qualities
who knows how to turn it off

own stays brought loyal
I turn not sad exactly

for my own purposes
I return not sad exactly

state reflexing indented in my own
