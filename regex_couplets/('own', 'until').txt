('own', 'until')

in a sharp downward turn 
until my purpose up in the sky

I brought my head down
until I could not tire 

even when close to my owning
until I purpose up in the sky

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
until the bill came

the impulse for my own prospects
until a happier time found

own stays brought loyal
