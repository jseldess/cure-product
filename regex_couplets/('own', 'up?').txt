('own', 'up?')

in a sharp downward turn 
an impure product

In a sharp downard turn
Then fall then summer from my face

It keeps coming down thankfully
Then fall then summer

Being grown
Without imparting cynicism 

to the down arrow
sudden downward turn

I brought my head down
I brought my qualities down

which I brought down with qualities
in a continuous vertiginous dream

I put my bread down
I brought my count down

I put my head down
and could be mapped and weighed

oddly grown over with historic bark
your bid to the next highest ranked network

even when close to my owning
If I take some different measure

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I tell you my purposes

One was up where it should be down
And for an ungraspable time

the impulse for my own prospects
the impulse for my own purposes

the impulse for my own purchases
the impulse to my purpose

for my own purchases
all parties would be helped

found dated for my own purchases
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

sound inundated for my own purchases
All parties would be held for my own purchases

the impulse my own prospects
But my not feeling the memory aside

impulse for my own purchases
The constituents 

and drowned inundated
and found redundant

own stays brought loyal
own that stays brought loyal

need one in best own
that stays brought loyal

in need one in that best own
by in the sound privacy

that in need one best own
by in the sounded privacy

for my own purposes
I return not sad exactly

state reflexing indented in my own
lung reflexing

my reflexing indented in my own tongue
tongue reflexing

reflexing indented in my own
the tongue and hands

the void kept owned impression
I have them trust in me

state kept owned impression
buy in the sound privacy

own best form
decisions that can be attributable

own best form to ourselves
home stays brought loyal

the people in own form
more to ourselves insure

the people in form own
inure tranquility

own stays bought loyal
form to more ourselves

bought stays own loyal
phrase them of our possessions

All that I own messageable
but I own all thatâ€™s messageable
