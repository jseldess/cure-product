('own', 'us')

in a sharp downward turn 
asynchronous 

In a sharp downard turn
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Being grown
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

to the down arrow
I want to cite a poem so usual

I brought my head down
In a vertiginous dream

I brought my qualities down
in a continuous vertiginous dream

which I brought down with qualities
In a continuous theme

I put my bread down
Remnant continuous pages

I brought my count down
The ventillation rushes on

oddly grown over with historic bark
So stay with us

even when close to my owning
a futile joyous white sun

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

the impulse for my own prospects
trackers collecting data on users

for my own purchases
in the form filled offered in trust

the impulse my own prospects
useless for not having paid

own stays brought loyal
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

in need one in that best own
radiating from housing

for my own purposes
I have them trust in me

state reflexing indented in my own
