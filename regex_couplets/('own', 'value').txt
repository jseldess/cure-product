('own', 'value')

in a sharp downward turn 
value falling off the edge of the face

In a sharp downard turn
Then I cannot see face value

to the down arrow
The value falling off the edge of the face

I brought my head down
The CEO tells me to embody values

which I brought down with qualities
And as an extension of the values

oddly grown over with historic bark
and key value

even when close to my owning
