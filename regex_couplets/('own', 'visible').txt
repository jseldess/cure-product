('own', 'visible')

in a sharp downward turn 
I assumed it was visible

In a sharp downard turn
Iâ€™ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

to the down arrow
And make myself a visible

I brought my head down
I assume the offers divisible

own best form to ourselves
that they were divisible
