('own', 'vision')

in a sharp downward turn 
I had me a vision

oddly grown over with historic bark
The planning process for visions

even when close to my owning
I resume attributable visions

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

the impulse for my own prospects
there wasnâ€™t any television 

own stays brought loyal
joined in my television

for my own purposes
visions that can be attainable

All that I own messageable
revisions that can be attributable
