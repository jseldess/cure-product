('own', 'visions')

in a sharp downward turn 
The planning process for visions

oddly grown over with historic bark
aspirating visions

even when close to my owning
I resume attributable visions

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
visions that can be attainable

All that I own messageable
revisions that can be attributable
