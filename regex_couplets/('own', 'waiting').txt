('own', 'waiting')

in a sharp downward turn 
There are spots waiting

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
Though we are waiting for her

the impulse for my own prospects
Though we are waiting 

own stays brought loyal
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

in need one in that best own
waiting out front or up above 

for my own purposes
