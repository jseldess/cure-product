('own', 'walk')

in a sharp downward turn 
Before we walk across the wide field

In a sharp downard turn
Before we walk across the wide opening

It keeps coming down thankfully
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Being grown
there was no walking along the pleasure

even when close to my owning
