('own', 'We')

in a sharp downward turn 
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

In a sharp downard turn
We can wrestle them with their goals

Being grown
We had to say goodbye there

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
We had inhabited actually

the impulse for my own prospects
We ask say in that case

own best form
