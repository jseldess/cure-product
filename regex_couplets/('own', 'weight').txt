('own', 'weight')

in a sharp downward turn 
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes

One was up where it should be down
weight of my purposes

the impulse for my own prospects
The weight kept moaned impression

my reflexing indented in my own tongue
