('own', 'were')

in a sharp downward turn 
When we had jobs that were to earn

I brought my head down
my desires were open

which I brought down with qualities
I wish my desires were open

I brought my qualities down
I argued the days were longer

even when close to my owning
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

the impulse for my own prospects
answered about 

own stays brought loyal
formerly a long time they were on

in need one in that best own
I answered what I thought

own that stays brought loyal
I answered about

for my own purchases
in the long time they were on

for my own purposes
that they were visible

own best form to ourselves
that they were divisible
