('own', 'When')

in a sharp downward turn 
When I woke up in the morning

In a sharp downard turn
When I want something

Being grown
When we had jobs that were to earn

I brought my head down
When they really take hold of my finger

which I brought down with qualities
When closed to my knowing

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
When I'm watching my tv 

own stays brought loyal
