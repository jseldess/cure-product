('own', 'Which')

in a sharp downward turn 
Which is a measure to never live out

Being grown
Which can be pronounced to the world

I brought my head down
Which is a pleasure to never live out

even when close to my owning
Which can be called confidence

the impulse for my own prospects
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

own stays brought loyal
