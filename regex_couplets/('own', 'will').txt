('own', 'will')

in a sharp downward turn 
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

Being grown
will not be the same

even when close to my owning
would only willingly break

own stays brought loyal
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

in need one in that best own
my daughter will learn 

own that stays brought loyal
