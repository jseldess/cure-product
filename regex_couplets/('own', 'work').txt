('own', 'work')

in a sharp downward turn 
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

In a sharp downard turn
nor work in this way daily

I brought my head down
Having transitioned from leisure to work

oddly grown over with historic bark
your bid to the next highest ranked network

even when close to my owning
nor envy honest work

the impulse for my own prospects
