('own', 'you.')

in a sharp downward turn 
Though how can you know without direction

Being grown
bring your child along

to the down arrow
You can hear it also through your leisure

I brought my head down
That you can see only the back of

oddly grown over with historic bark
your bid to the next highest ranked network

even when close to my owning
a futile joyous white sun

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I tell you my purposes

One was up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes

the impulse for my own prospects
the young ripples inaudibly

the void kept owned impression
