('own', 'your')

in a sharp downward turn 
You can hear it also through your leisure

Being grown
bring your child along

to the down arrow
May I have your zip code

I brought my head down
your bid to the next highest ranked network

even when close to my owning
This is your voice 

the impulse for my own prospects
