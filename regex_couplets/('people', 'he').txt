('people', 'he')

Life is with people
And as an extension of the values

people would be helped
They have very many choices

people would prevent
in the face that I had

people 
the right of surcharge

Possessions people
I have them lost

that agreed to one the people
the people in home form

the people in own form
the people in form own

that agreed home to people
buy in the sound privacy
