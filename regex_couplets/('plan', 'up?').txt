('plan', 'up?')

and is relentlessly planned
Without a proposed budget

The planning process for visions
upsent in the afternoon

I see the back of the planning process
blue and sun again a second, then night

The planning process is for visionaries only
of my economic value

the planning process for decisions
I see the back of falling values

and for which the plan agreed
in the form filled offered in trust

and to which the plan agreed
it can be uncomfortable
