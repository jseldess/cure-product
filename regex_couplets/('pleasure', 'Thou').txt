('pleasure', 'Thou')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Though there are quarters goals

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

up in the television pleasure
Though in not many acts

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Though we are waiting for her
