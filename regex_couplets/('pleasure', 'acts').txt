('pleasure', 'acts')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
I refuse indelible tracts

up in the television pleasure
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Though in not many acts

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
