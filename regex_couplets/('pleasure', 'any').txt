('pleasure', 'any')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Or the company

there was no walking along the pleasure
there wasn’t any television 

up in the television pleasure
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in not many tracks up in the sky

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I walk up and don’t work anymore
