('pleasure', 'count')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Then I constellate my time family country

Which is a pleasure to never live out
So I constellate the time family country

there was no walking along the pleasure
without the long time I was accounting

up in the television pleasure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
in the simple act of opening an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
around my country
