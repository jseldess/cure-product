('pleasure', 'he')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

there was no walking along the pleasure
there was no promotion

up in the television pleasure
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
What was the last time

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in the simple act of reading

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
You can hear it also through static leisure
