('pleasure', 'leisure')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
You can hear it also through your leisure

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Having transitioned from leisure to work

there was no walking along the pleasure
You can hear it also through static leisure
