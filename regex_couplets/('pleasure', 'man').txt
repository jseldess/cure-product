('pleasure', 'man')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Which is a pleasure to never live out
not many face up

up in the television pleasure
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in not many tracks up in the sky

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
that of the man with the dyed blond hair
