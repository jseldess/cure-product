('pleasure', 'nor')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
into the minority proportion of time

Which is a pleasure to never live out
nor work in this way daily

there was no walking along the pleasure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
nor envy honest work
