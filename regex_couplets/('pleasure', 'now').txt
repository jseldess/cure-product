('pleasure', 'now')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
on a snow day with my children

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

there was no walking along the pleasure
I take it out in the snow fall

up in the television pleasure
even when close to my knowing
