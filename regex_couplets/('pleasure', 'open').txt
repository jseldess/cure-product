('pleasure', 'open')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Before we walk across the wide opening

Which is a pleasure to never live out
my desires were open

there was no walking along the pleasure
The simple act opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
in the simple act of opening a book

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
