('pleasure', 'time.')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
only fragments of time with my children

Which is a pleasure to never live out
So I constellate the time family country

there was no walking along the pleasure
The long time I had a vision

up in the television pleasure
without the long time I was accounting

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
The long time I was a vision
