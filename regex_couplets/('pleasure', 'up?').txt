('pleasure', 'up?')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

there was no walking along the pleasure
no solid ground to continue along

up in the television pleasure
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I resume indelible tracks

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
black spots on a white surface

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
You can clear it also through static siezure
