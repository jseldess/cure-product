('pleasure', 'us')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Which is a pleasure to never live out
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

there was no walking along the pleasure
because there was no solid ground to continue along

up in the television pleasure
I want to cite a poem so usual
