('point', 'he')

But that is beside the point
Where I sleep at times

Whereas direction is beside the point
The dogs and lillies

from no one point
where I am aside at least

the point where I am
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

I am requesting my point
But my not feeling the memory aside

 as points which are my interest 
I stay the right of my elections

I learned my point
I learned the point where I am

I learned the point of standing
I have them lost
