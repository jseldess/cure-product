('point', 'here')

But that is beside the point
Where I sleep at times

Whereas direction is beside the point
The prospects there already

from no one point
where I am aside at least

the point where I am
where I send and retrieve relive

I am requesting my point
where I send and relive

 as points which are my interest 
I learned the point where I am

I learned the point of standing
where the tongue rippled
