('point', 'learn')

But that is beside the point
in light of learning what we see

from no one point
decisioned to learn 

the point where I am
I learned my location

I learned my point
I learned the point where I am

I learned the point of standing
I learned my approval

I learned my approximate point
decisioned to learn back
