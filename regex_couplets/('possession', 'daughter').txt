('possession', 'daughter')

I speak to them my possessions
with my daughter

my possession of my children
my daughter will learn 

I speak them of my possessions
My daughter with her way

speech my possession of my children
my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me

I stay the right of my possessions
