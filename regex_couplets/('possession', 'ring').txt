('possession', 'ring')

I speak to them my possessions
firing and connecting somewhere

I stay the right of my possessions 
The prospect for veering healthily

Or can have seen offering possession
and can see offering

seen having or offering possession
can have seen offering possession

I assume possession to others
in school and can see offering
