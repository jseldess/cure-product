('possession', 'so')

I speak to them my possessions
so still watch them

my possession of my children
by in the sound privacy

phrase them of my possessions
by in the sounded privacy

I speak them of my possessions
sizes track for asking sound

speech my possession of my children
sizes asking for tracking sound

I stay the right of my possessions 
buy in the sound privacy

phrase them of our possessions
and could be inflected with reasons

speak them of my possessions
bought in the sounded privacy

Or can have seen offering possession
