('possession', 'top')

I speak to them my possessions
stopping into the prospect

my possession of my children
stopped light with validated fields

I speak them of my possessions
stopped light with validated faces

I stay the right of my possessions 
stopping in the middle

phrase them of our possessions
stopping off in all directions

Or can have seen offering possession
