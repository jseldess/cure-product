I speak to them my possessions
so still watch them

I speak them of my possessions
by in the sound privacy

phrase them of my possessions
by in the sounded privacy

speak them of my possessions
sizes track for asking sound

I stay the right of my possessions 
buy in the sound privacy

phrase them of our possessions
and could be inflected with reasons
