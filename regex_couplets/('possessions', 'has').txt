('possessions', 'has')

I speak to them my possessions
if that has anything

my possessions
phase decisioned by the prospect

I speak them of my possessions
converting sight into a purchase

speak them of my possessions
phase decisioned

I stay the right of my possessions 
at the site of a purchase

possessions people
which as tracked befitted phased
