('possessions', 'her')

I speak to them my possessions
if there is anything 

my possessions
Though we are waiting for her

I speak them of my possessions
I presume to others

speak them of my possessions
Where in me did I host

phrase them of my possessions
with her waves

I stay the right of my possessions 
I learned the point where I am

possessions people
where the tongue rippled

phrase them of our possessions
The prospects there already
