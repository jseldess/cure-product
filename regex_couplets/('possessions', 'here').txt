('possessions', 'here')

I speak to them my possessions
if there is anything 

my possessions
Where in me did I host

I speak them of my possessions
Is there a baby and a bear

speak them of my possessions
By my memory elsewhere

I stay the right of my possessions 
I learned the point where I am

possessions people
where the tongue rippled

phrase them of our possessions
The prospects there already

phrase them of my possessions
The offers there already
