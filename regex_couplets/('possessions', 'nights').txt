('possessions', 'nights')

I speak to them my possessions
with dawn already formerly nights 

I speak them of my possessions
dawn already formerly nights 

speak them of my possessions
battery dawn nights 

phrase them of my possessions
battery dawn nights blending themselves

I stay the right of my possessions
