('possessions', 'top')

I speak to them my possessions
stopping into the prospect

I speak them of my possessions
stopped light with validated fields

speak them of my possessions
stopped light with validated faces

I stay the right of my possessions 
stopping in the middle

phrase them of our possessions
stopping off in all directions
