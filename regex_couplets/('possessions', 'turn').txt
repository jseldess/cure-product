('possessions', 'turn')

I speak to them my possessions
who knows how to turn it off

I speak them of my possessions
I turn not sad exactly

I stay the right of my possessions 
I returned not sad exactly

To the right of interned possessions
to return what I bought

the right of possessions
I returned to location

possessions people
