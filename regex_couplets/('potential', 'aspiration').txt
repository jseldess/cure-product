('potential', 'aspiration')

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
They are called aspirational

I am full of potential
with little reasons to aspiration

with full potential to movement
embodied aspirations

full of potential
with little reason to aspiration

that potential is there for you
full of aspirations
