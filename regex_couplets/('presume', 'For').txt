('presume', 'For')

So I presume the offers already
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I can’t presume to need others
Forecasting the story before dawn

I continue to presume
For an ungraspable time

I presume to others
Formerly a way like this one

I presume the offers
For a while I think I don’t listen

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
