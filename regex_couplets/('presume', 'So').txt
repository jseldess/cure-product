('presume', 'so')

So I presume the offers already
I’ll pull myself another personality type

and can’t presume to need
reasons resources

Then I can’t presume to need others
You can hear it also through your leisure

I continue to presume
If I take some different measure

I presume to others
so still watch them

I presume the offers
and could be inflected with reasons

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
