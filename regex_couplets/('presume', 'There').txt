('presume', 'There')

So I presume the offers already
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

and can’t presume to need
There are quarterly goals

Then I can’t presume to need others
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I continue to presume
There are spots waiting

I presume to others
There are constant ways

I presume the offers
