('presume', 'To')

So I presume the offers already
To my children Walt Whitman

and can’t presume to need
To my chidren

Then I can’t presume to need others
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

I continue to presume
To neither study

I presume to others
To the ends of transactions

I presume the offers
