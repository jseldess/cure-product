('presume', 'Which')

So I presume the offers already
Which is a measure to never live out

and canâ€™t presume to need
Which can be pronounced to the world

I continue to presume
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I presume to others
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

I presume the offers
