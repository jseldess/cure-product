('presume', 'while')

So I presume the offers already
Looking back while I should be sleeping

I continue to presume
while consuming damage

I presume to others
I answered while interfaced

I presume the offers
for a while to listen already

So I presume the offers at home already
for a while to listen 

presume the offers at 
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
