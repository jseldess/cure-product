('presume', 'across')

So I presume the offers already
Before we walk across the wide field

and canâ€™t presume to need
across the retinas

I continue to presume
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

I presume to others
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
