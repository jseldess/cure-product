('presume', 'act')

So I presume the offers already
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

and can’t presume to need
I was enjoined to act again myself

Then I can’t presume to need others
I was enjoined to act again

I continue to presume
we had inhabited actually

I presume to others
to the ends of my transactions

I presume the offers
before I act on them

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
