('presume', 'any')

So I presume the offers already
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

and can’t presume to need
at any time it can drift again

Then I can’t presume to need others
Or the company

I continue to presume
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I presume to others
if there is anything 

I presume the offers
