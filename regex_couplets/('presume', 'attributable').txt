('presume', 'attributable')

So I presume the offers already
I resume attributable visions

I continue to presume
attributable visions

I presume to others
that decisions can be attributable

I presume the offers
revisions that can be attributable

So I presume the offers
decisions that can be attributable

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
