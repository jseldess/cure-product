('presume', 'away')

So I presume the offers already
drifting away

and can’t presume to need
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
drifting away needs

Then I can’t presume to feed others
drifting away from the task

I continue to presume
Who throws contours away

I presume to others
