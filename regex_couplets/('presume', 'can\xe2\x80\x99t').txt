('presume', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

So I presume the offers already
I can’t fix them without direction

and can’t presume to need
But I can’t let myself treat 

Then I can’t presume to need others
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
But I can’t let myself disregard

I continue to presume
Though we can’t help waiting

I presume to others
I can’t remember them

I presume the offers
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
