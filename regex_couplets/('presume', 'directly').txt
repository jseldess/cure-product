('presume', 'directly')

So I presume the offers already
if not directly on my skin

and canâ€™t presume to need
But not to me directly

I continue to presume
The sun high enough to enter directly

I presume to others
The sun high enough to strike directly

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
