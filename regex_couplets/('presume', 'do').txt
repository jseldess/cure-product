('presume', 'do')

So I presume the offers already
in a sharp downward turn 

and can’t presume to need
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I can’t presume to need others
to the down arrow

I continue to presume
here is the site of the battle of maldon

I presume to others
latency which doesn’t mean anything

I presume the offers
I only think I don’t listen

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
