('presume', 'drifting')

So I presume the offers already
drifting away

and can’t presume to need
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I can’t presume to feed others
drifting away from the task

I continue to presume
