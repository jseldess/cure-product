('presume', 'eat')

So I presume the offers already
too sunny to eat ice cream

and can’t presume to need
But I can’t let myself treat 

Then I can’t presume to need others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

drifting away needs others presume desires
I let myself treat

I continue to presume
And from that great distance

I presume to others
for the creation of the universe

I presume the offers
