('presume', 'ending')

So I presume the offers already
battery dawn nights blending themselves

and canâ€™t presume to need
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I continue to presume
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

I presume to others
battery dawn nights ending themselves

I presume the offers
