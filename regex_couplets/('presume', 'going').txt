('presume', 'going')

So I presume the offers already
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

and can’t presume to need
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I continue to presume
The way that she is going

I presume to others
The way that I am going

I presume the offers
