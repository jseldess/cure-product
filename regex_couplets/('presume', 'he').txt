('presume', 'he')

So I presume the offers already
The prospects there already

and can’t presume to need
others desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
In the right sense

I continue to presume
I get through there

I presume to others
speak them of my possessions

I presume the offers
by the private preambles

So I presume the offers
So I presume the offers at home already

presume the offers at 
traffick is there nonetheless

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
I assume the offers reliable
