('presume', 'her')

So I presume the offers already
The prospects there already

and can’t presume to need
others desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
where I sleep at times

I continue to presume
I get through there

I presume to others
Where in me did I host

I presume the offers
The offers there already

So I presume the offers
traffick is there nonetheless

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
I assume possession to others
