('presume', 'live')

So I presume the offers already
Which is a measure to never live out

and canâ€™t presume to need
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I continue to presume
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I presume to others
where I send and relive

I presume the offers
