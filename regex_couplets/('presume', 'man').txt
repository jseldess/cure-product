('presume', 'man')

So I presume the offers already
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

and can’t presume to need
To my children Walt Whitman

Then I can’t presume to need others
not many face up

I continue to presume
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

I presume to others
and that man comes on to tell me 

I presume the offers
