('presume', 'middle')

So I presume the offers already
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

I continue to presume
stopping in the middle

I presume the offers
stepping in the middle

So I presume the offers
stepping off into the middle

I presume to others
stepping off in to the middle

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
