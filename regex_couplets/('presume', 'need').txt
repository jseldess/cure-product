('presume', 'need')

So I presume the offers already
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

and can’t presume to need
Then I can’t presume to need others

drifting away needs others presume desires
drifting away needs

Then I can’t presume to feed others
I need the work

I continue to presume
And need out in front purchase

I presume to others
in need one in that best own

I presume the offers
