('presume', 'others')

So I presume the offers already
others desires

and can’t presume to need
Then I can’t presume to need others

drifting away needs others presume desires
If I let myself see others desires

Then I can’t presume to feed others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

I continue to presume
I presume to others

I presume the offers
I assume possession to others

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
