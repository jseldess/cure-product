('presume', 'over')

So I presume the offers already
I step over the edge

and can’t presume to need
over the long time up in the sky

Then I can’t presume to need others
over the time line I was on

I continue to presume
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

I presume to others
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
