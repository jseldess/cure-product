('presume', 'prospect')

So I presume the offers already
The prospects there already

and canâ€™t presume to need
the impulse for my own prospects

I presume to others
stopping into the prospect

I presume the offers
the prospects being seen by me

So I presume the offers
The prospect for careening attached

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
