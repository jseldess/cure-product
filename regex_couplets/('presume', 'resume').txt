('presume', 'resume')

So I presume the offers already
and can’t presume to need

Then I can’t presume to need others
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to feed others
Then I can’t presume to treat others

I continue to presume
I presume to others

I presume the offers
So I resume the offers already

So I presume the offers
So I presume the offers at home already

presume the offers at 
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
