('presume', 'ring')

So I presume the offers already
interferring 

and can’t presume to need
bring your child along

Then I can’t presume to need others
ring

I continue to presume
storing in surfeit

I presume to others
firing and connecting somewhere

I presume the offers
The prospect for veering healthily

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
Or can have seen offering possession
