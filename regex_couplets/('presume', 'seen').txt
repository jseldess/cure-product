('presume', 'seen')

So I presume the offers already
under the last seen principle

I continue to presume
Having seen more than 

I presume to others
being seen by me

I presume the offers
Having seen more than I can remember 

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
Or can have seen offering possession
