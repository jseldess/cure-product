('presume', 'step')

So I presume the offers already
I step off the edge

and canâ€™t presume to need
What the next step

I continue to presume
step in by the prospect

I presume to others
phase decision step in

I presume the offers
stepping in the middle

So I presume the offers
stepping off into the middle

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
