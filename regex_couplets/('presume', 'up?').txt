('presume', 'up?')

So I presume the offers already
at home brought into privacy

and can’t presume to need
But I can’t let myself treat 

Then I can’t presume to need others
as an impure product

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
as a pure product

I continue to presume
If I take a different measure

I presume to others
own stays brought loyal

I presume the offers
revisions that can be attributable

So I presume the offers
So I presume the offers at home already

presume the offers at 
but I own all that’s messageable

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
I assume the offers reliable
