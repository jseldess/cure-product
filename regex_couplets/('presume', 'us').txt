('presume', 'us')

So I presume the offers already
asynchronous 

and can’t presume to need
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Then I can’t presume to need others
I want to cite a poem so usual

I continue to presume
a futile joyous white sun

I presume to others
in the form filled offered in trust

I presume the offers
