('presume', 'visible')

So I presume the offers already
I assumed it was visible

and can’t presume to need
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

Then I can’t presume to need others
And make myself a visible

I continue to presume
I assume the offers divisible

I presume the offers
that they were divisible

I presume to others
I assumed that they were divisible

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
