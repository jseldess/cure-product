('presume', 'you.')

So I presume the offers already
Though how can you know without direction

and can’t presume to need
bring your child along

Then I can’t presume to need others
You can hear it also through your leisure

I continue to presume
a futile joyous white sun

I presume to others
the young ripples inaudibly

I presume the offers
