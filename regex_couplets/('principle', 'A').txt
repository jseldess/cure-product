('principle', 'A')

under the last seen principle
As a clone, illegally conceived

Under the grass principle
COPY DREAM 

Under the grasp principle
Articles all around us

Under the last principle of purchasing power
And we had to say goodbye to her there

under the past principle
Articles all around stores in surfeit

Under the last principle
And need out in front purchase
