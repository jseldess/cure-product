('principle', 'he')

under the last seen principle
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

Under the grass principle
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

Under the grasp principle
Then I continue to dream then

Under the last principle 
Under the last principle of purchasing power

under the past principle
We had to say goodbye there
