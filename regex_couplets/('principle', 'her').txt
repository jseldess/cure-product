('principle', 'her')

under the last seen principle
in traversing get through there

Under the grass principle
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

Under the grasp principle
And we had to say goodbye to her there

under the past principle
We had to say goodbye there

Under the last principle
We had to buy there

Under the last principle of purchasing power
where I need gravity
