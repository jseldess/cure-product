('principle', 'up?')

under the last seen principle
I resume attributable visions

Under the grass principle
having been an ungraspable time

Under the grasp principle
I could in effect credit

Under the last principle 
having been purchased out of you

Under the last principle of purchasing power
she lay under the grass

under the past principle
Then blue and sun again a second, then night
