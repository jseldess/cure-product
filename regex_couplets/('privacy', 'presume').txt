('privacy', 'presume')

at home brought into privacy
and canâ€™t presume to need

by in the sound privacy
I presume to others

by in the sounded privacy
So I presume the offers already

already brought into privacy
I presume the offers

brought messageable into privacy
presume the offers at 

in privacy that is messageable
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
