('privacy', 'prospect')

at home brought into privacy
The prospects there already

by in the sound privacy
decisioned by the prospect

by in the sounded privacy
step in by the prospect

buy in the surrounded privacy
stopping into the prospect

bought in the sounded privacy
the impulse my own prospects

buy in the sound privacy
speech that is of by prospects

bought in the surrounded privacy 
the prospects being seen by me

brought messageable into privacy
The prospect for careening attached
