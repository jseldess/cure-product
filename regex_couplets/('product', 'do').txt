('product', 'do')

an impure product
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

What is an impure product
In a sharp downard turn

as a cure product
drifting does not feel an exception

as a pure product
The dogs and lillies

as an impure product
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

the least productive of myself
I only think I don’t listen
