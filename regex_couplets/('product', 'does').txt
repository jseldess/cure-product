('product', 'does')

an impure product
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

What is an impure product
does not feel an exception

as a cure product
drifting does not feel an exception

as a pure product
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

as an impure product
and it doesn’t take long

the least productive of myself
