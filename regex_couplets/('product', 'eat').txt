('product', 'eat')

an impure product
too sunny to eat ice cream

What is an impure product
I reach repeated expressions first

as a cure product
But I can’t let myself treat 

as a pure product
Then I can’t presume to treat others

as an impure product
I let myself treat

the least productive of myself
for the creation of the universe
