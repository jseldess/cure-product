('product', 'here')

an impure product
Of course there is a direction

What is an impure product
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

as a cure product
I’ll get there eventually

as a pure product
where I sleep at times

as an impure product
There are quarterly goals

the least productive of myself
where I am aside
