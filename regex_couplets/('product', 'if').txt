('product', 'if')

an impure product
drifting away

What is an impure product
if not directly on my skin

as a cure product
drifting does not feel an exception

as a pure product
drifting away needs others presume desires

as an impure product
at any time it can drift again

the least productive of myself
if only on the way to the trash
