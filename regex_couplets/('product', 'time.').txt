('product', 'time.')

an impure product
Itâ€™s time to wake up, Papa!

What is an impure product
only fragments of time with my children

as a cure product
where I sleep at times

as an impure product
at any time it can drift again

as a pure product
Then I constellate my time family country

the least productive of myself
in the long time they were on
