('product', 'up?')

an impure product
asynchronous 

What is an impure product
When I woke up in the morning

as a cure product
The sun isnâ€™t up

as a pure product
Then fall then summer

as an impure product
drifting away needs others presume desires

the least productive of myself
the least instructive of myself
