('prospect', 'For')

The prospects there already
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

the impulse for my own prospects
For my own purchases

the impulse my own prospects
Formerly a way like this one

stopping into the prospect
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

The prospect for careening attached
