('prospect', 'Thou')

The prospects there already
Though there are quarters goals

the impulse for my own prospects
Though we are waiting for her

the impulse my own prospects
Though we are breaking 

stopping into the prospect
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

speech that is of by prospects
Though we can’t help waiting

decisioned by the prospect
