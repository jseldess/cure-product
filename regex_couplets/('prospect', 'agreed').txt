The prospects there already
and to which I’ve agreed

the impulse for my own prospects
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

the impulse my own prospects
and for which the plan agreed

stopping into the prospect
and to which the plan agreed

speech that is of by prospects
that agreed one of rest

decisioned by the prospect
that agreed home

step in by the prospect
