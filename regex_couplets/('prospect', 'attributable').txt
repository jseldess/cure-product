('prospect', 'attributable')

The prospects there already
I resume attributable visions

the impulse for my own prospects
that decisions can be attributable

stopping into the prospect
decisions that can be attributable

speech that is of by prospects
revisions that can be attributable

the prospects being seen by me
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
