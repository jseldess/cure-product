('prospect', 'but')

The prospects there already
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

the impulse for my own prospects
that decisions can be attributable

stopping into the prospect
but for memory elsewhere

speech that is of by prospects
decisions that can be attributable

decisioned by the prospect
revisions that can be attributable

the prospects being seen by me
but I own all that’s messageable

The prospect for careening attached
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
