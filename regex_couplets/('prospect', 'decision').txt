('prospect', 'decision')

The prospects there already
the planning process for decisions

the impulse for my own prospects
forgetting decisions 

stopping into the prospect
decisioned to learn 

speech that is of by prospects
decisioned by the prospect

step in by the prospect
phase decisioned by the prospect

for learning by the prospect
that decisions can be attributable

step by into the prospect
decisions that can be attributable

the prospects being seen by me
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
