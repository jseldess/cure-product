('prospect', 'decisioned')

The prospects there already
decisioned to learn 

stopping into the prospect
decisioned to learn back

speech that is of by prospects
decisioned by the prospect

step in by the prospect
phase decisioned by the prospect

for learning by the prospect
phase decisioned

step by into the prospect
I ask say in that phase decisioned

the prospects being seen by me
