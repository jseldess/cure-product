('prospect', 'decisions')

The prospects there already
the planning process for decisions

the impulse for my own prospects
forgetting decisions 

stopping into the prospect
that decisions can be attributable

speech that is of by prospects
decisions that can be attributable

decisioned by the prospect
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
