('prospect', 'earn')

The prospects there already
in light of learning what we see

the impulse for my own prospects
decisioned to learn 

stopping into the prospect
decisioned to learn back

speech that is of by prospects
phase decision for learning

for learning by the prospect
a precision for learning

step by into the prospect
my daughter will learn 

decisioned by the prospect
I learned my location

step in by the prospect
