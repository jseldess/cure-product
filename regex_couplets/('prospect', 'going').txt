('prospect', 'going')

The prospects there already
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

the impulse for my own prospects
The way that she is going

the impulse my own prospects
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

stopping into the prospect
The way that I am going

speech that is of by prospects
