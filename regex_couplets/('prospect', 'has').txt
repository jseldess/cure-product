('prospect', 'has')

The prospects there already
conversations with our purchase

the impulse for my own prospects
the impulse for my own purchases

the impulse my own prospects
impulse for my own purchases

stopping into the prospect
if that has anything

speech that is of by prospects
phase decisioned by the prospect

for learning by the prospect
converting sight into a purchase

decisioned by the prospect
phase decisioned

step by into the prospect
for my own purchases

step in by the prospect
which as tracked befitted phased

the prospects being seen by me
