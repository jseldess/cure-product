('prospect', 'he')

The prospects there already
by the private preambles

the impulse for my own prospects
where I end

the impulse my own prospects
But my not feeling the memory aside

stopping into the prospect
Where in me did I host

speech that is of by prospects
by in the sound privacy

decisioned by the prospect
by in the sounded privacy

step in by the prospect
phase decisioned by the prospect

for learning by the prospect
step by into the prospect

the prospects being seen by me
The offers there already

The prospect of seeing healthily 
between the preambles

The prospect for careening attached
The prospect for careening healthily

The prospect for seeing healthily
between the preamble

The prospect for veering healthily
The prospect for steering healthily
