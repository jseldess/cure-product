('prospect', 'here')

The prospects there already
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

the impulse for my own prospects
where I end

the impulse my own prospects
where I send and retrieve aside

stopping into the prospect
Where in me did I host

speech that is of by prospects
Is there a baby and a bear

decisioned by the prospect
By my memory elsewhere

step in by the prospect
The offers there already

The prospects being seen by me
traffick is there nonetheless

The prospect for careening attached
