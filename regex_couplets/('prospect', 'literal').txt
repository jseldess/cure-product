('prospect', 'literal')

The prospects there already
and literally moved

the impulse for my own prospects
as it was designed literally

the impulse my own prospects
and literally unproved

stopping into the prospect
and literally moved about

speech that is of by prospects
not literally moved about

decisioned by the prospect
