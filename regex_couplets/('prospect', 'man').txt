('prospect', 'man')

The prospects there already
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

the impulse for my own prospects
They have very many choices

the impulse my own prospects
and that man comes on to tell me 

stopping into the prospect
The many transparent pixel calls

speech that is of by prospects
