('prospect', 'moved')

The prospects there already
and literally moved

the impulse for my own prospects
myself moved literally as it is

stopping into the prospect
and literally moved about

speech that is of by prospects
not literally moved about

the impulse my own prospects
not literally moved

decisioned by the prospect
