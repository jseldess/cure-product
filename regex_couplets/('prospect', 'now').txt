('prospect', 'now')

The prospects there already
On a snow day with my children

the impulse for my own prospects
knowing the constituents

stopping into the prospect
who knows the way

speech that is of by prospects
who knows how to turn it off

decisioned by the prospect
that their knowing

step in by the prospect
