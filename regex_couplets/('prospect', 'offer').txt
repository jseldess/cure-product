('prospect', 'offer')

The prospects there already
in the form filled offered in trust

the impulse for my own prospects
in the form filled offered trust

stopping into the prospect
in track as offer asked 

speech that is of by prospects
I assume the offers reliable

decisioned by the prospect
I presume the offers

the prospects being seen by me
The offers there already

The prospect of seeing healthily 
So I presume the offers already

The prospect for careening attached
I assume the offers revisitable
