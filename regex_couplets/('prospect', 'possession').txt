('prospect', 'possession')

The prospects there already
I speak to them my possessions

stopping into the prospect
my possession of my children

speech that is of by prospects
phrase them of my possessions

decisioned by the prospect
I speak them of my possessions

step in by the prospect
speech my possession of my children

the impulse my own prospects
I stay the right of my possessions 

phase decisioned by the prospect
Or can have seen offering possession
