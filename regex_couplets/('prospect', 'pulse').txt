('prospect', 'pulse')

The prospects there already
impulse control

the impulse for my own prospects
the impulse for my own purposes

the impulse my own prospects
impulse for my own purchases

stopping into the prospect
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

speech that is of by prospects
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

decisioned by the prospect
