('prospect', 'resume')

The prospects there already
and canâ€™t presume to need

the impulse for my own prospects
I presume to others

stopping into the prospect
So I presume the offers already

speech that is of by prospects
I presume the offers

the prospects being seen by me
So I resume the offers already

The prospect for careening attached
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
