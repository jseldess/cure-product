('prospect', 'side')

The prospects there already
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

the impulse for my own prospects
where I send and retrieve aside

the impulse my own prospects
But my not feeling the memory aside

stopping into the prospect
by the side of the hosting service

speech that is of by prospects
But my not feeling the memory inside

decisioned by the prospect
where I send and relive aside

step in by the prospect
