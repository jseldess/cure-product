('prospect', 'sound')

The prospects there already
sound inundated for my own purchases

the impulse my own prospects
and sound redundant

the impulse for my own prospects
for not paying sound overwhelmed

stopping into the prospect
by in the sound privacy

decisioned by the prospect
by in the sounded privacy

step in by the prospect
sizes track for asking sound

speech that is of by prospects
sizes asking for tracking sound

phase decisioned by the prospect
bought in the sounded privacy

the prospects being seen by me
