('prospect', 'stay')

The prospects there already
wrestling to stay still

the impulse for my own prospects
own stays brought loyal

stopping into the prospect
own that stays brought loyal

speech that is of by prospects
that stays brought loyal

decisioned by the prospect
I stay the right of my elections

step in by the prospect
