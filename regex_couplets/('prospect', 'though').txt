('prospect', 'though')

The prospects there already
As though stationary and a destination

the impulse for my own prospects
I thought

the impulse my own prospects
after though thereâ€™s no memory

stopping into the prospect
though we are waiting for her

speech that is of by prospects
I answered what I thought

decisioned by the prospect
