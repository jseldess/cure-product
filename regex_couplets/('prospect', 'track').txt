('prospect', 'track')

The prospects there already
I reuse indelible tracks 

the impulse for my own prospects
and other types of tracking technology

the impulse my own prospects
which as tracked befitted 

stopping into the prospect
which as tracked befitted phased

for learning by the prospect
sizes track for asking sound

speech that is of by prospects
sizes asking for tracking sound

decisioned by the prospect
between tracked and buffered

the prospects being seen by me
