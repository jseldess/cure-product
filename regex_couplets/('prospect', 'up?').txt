('prospect', 'up?')

The prospects there already
between bills and stuffed animals

the impulse for my own prospects
the impulse for my own purposes

the impulse my own prospects
But my not feeling the memory aside

stopping into the prospect
in the form filled offered in trust

speech that is of by prospects
by in the sound privacy

decisioned by the prospect
by in the sounded privacy

step in by the prospect
my daughter will learn 

phase decisioned by the prospect
buy in the surrounded privacy

for learning by the prospect
sizes track for asking sound

the prospects being seen by me
at home brought into private

The prospect of seeing healthily 
So I presume the offers already

The prospect for careening attached
I presume the offers
