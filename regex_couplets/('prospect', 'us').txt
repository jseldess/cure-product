('prospect', 'us')

The prospects there already
asynchronous 

the impulse for my own prospects
trackers collecting data on users

the impulse my own prospects
useless for not having paid

stopping into the prospect
in the form filled offered in trust

speech that is of by prospects
radiating from housing

decisioned by the prospect
