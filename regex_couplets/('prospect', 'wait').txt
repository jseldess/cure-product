('prospect', 'wait')

The prospects there already
There are spots waiting

the impulse for my own prospects
Though we are waiting for her

the impulse my own prospects
not needing to wait

stopping into the prospect
Though we can’t help waiting

speech that is of by prospects
waiting out front or up above 

decisioned by the prospect
