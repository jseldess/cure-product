('prospect', 'will')

The prospects there already
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

the impulse for my own prospects
would only willingly break

stopping into the prospect
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

speech that is of by prospects
my daughter will learn 

decisioned by the prospect
