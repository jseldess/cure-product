('prospects', 'assume')

The prospects there already
I assumed it was visible

the impulse for my own prospects
I assumed 

speech that is of by prospects
I assumed what I draw

the impulse my own prospects
I assume the offers reliable

the prospects being seen by me
I assume the offers revisitable
