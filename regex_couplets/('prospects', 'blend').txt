('prospects', 'blend')

The prospects there already
battery dawn nights blending themselves

the impulse for my own prospects
where I blend and relive

speech that is of by prospects
where lights blended themselves

the impulse my own prospects
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

the prospects being seen by me
