('prospects', 'decisions')

The prospects there already
the planning process for decisions

the impulse for my own prospects
forgetting decisions 

speech that is of by prospects
that decisions can be attributable

the impulse my own prospects
decisions that can be attributable

the prospects being seen by me
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
