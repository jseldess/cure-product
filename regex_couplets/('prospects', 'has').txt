('prospects', 'has')

The prospects there already
conversations with our purchase

the impulse for my own prospects
the impulse for my own purchases

the impulse my own prospects
impulse for my own purchases

speech that is of by prospects
phase decisioned by the prospect

the prospects being seen by me
converting sight into a purchase
