('prospects', 'man')

The prospects there already
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

the impulse for my own prospects
They have very many choices

the impulse my own prospects
and that man comes on to tell me 

speech that is of by prospects
The many transparent pixel calls

the prospects being seen by me
