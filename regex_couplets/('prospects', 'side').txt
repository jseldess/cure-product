('prospects', 'side')

The prospects there already
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

the impulse for my own prospects
where I send and retrieve aside

the impulse my own prospects
But my not feeling the memory aside

speech that is of by prospects
But my not feeling the memory inside

the prospects being seen by me
