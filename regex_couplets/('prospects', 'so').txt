('prospects', 'so')

The prospects there already
Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type

the impulse for my own prospects
sound inundated for my own purchases

the impulse my own prospects
and sound redundant

speech that is of by prospects
by in the sound privacy

the prospects being seen by me
and could be inflected with reasons
