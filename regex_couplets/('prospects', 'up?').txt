('prospects', 'up?')

The prospects there already
between bills and stuffed animals

the impulse for my own prospects
the impulse for my own purposes

the impulse my own prospects
But my not feeling the memory aside

speech that is of by prospects
by in the sound privacy

the prospects being seen by me
at home brought into private
