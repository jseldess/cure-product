('pull', 'do')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
in a sharp downward turn 

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
to the down arrow

I’ll pull my data higher up
The dogs and lillies

fish pulled out of the lake
I brought my qualities down

I’ll pull myself higher up
So that I don’t notice I am the only one
