('pull', 'earn')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
in light of learning what we see

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
When we had jobs that were to earn

fish pulled out of the lake
I spend time online learning to code

I’ll pull myself higher up
learned without too much difficulty to code
