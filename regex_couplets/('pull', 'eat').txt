('pull', 'eat')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
too sunny to eat ice cream

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I’ll pull my data higher up
executive breath

fish pulled out of the lake
Where I put it beating

I’ll pull myself higher up
execute breath
