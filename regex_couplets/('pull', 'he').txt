('pull', 'he')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
off the edge of the world

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
Face falling off the edge of the face

I’ll pull my data higher up
higher up in the internet

I’ll pull myself higher up
I’ll get there eventually

fish pulled out of the lake
and my heart rate

I’ll pull my data
high up in the internet
