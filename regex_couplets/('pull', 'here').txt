('pull', 'here')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I’ll get there eventually

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
where I sleep at times

I’ll pull my data higher up
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

fish pulled out of the lake
Where I put it beating

I’ll pull myself higher up
there was no promotion
