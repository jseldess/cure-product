('pull', 'inter')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
way high up in the inter

I’ll pull my data higher up
higher up in the internet

I’ll pull myself higher up
high up in the internet

fish pulled out of the lake
hold at intervals riding forward

I’ll pull my data
way high up in the internet
