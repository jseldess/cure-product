('pull', 'just')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I’ll pull my data higher up
was not just a defeat

fish pulled out of the lake
I just got a letter
