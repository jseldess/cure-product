('pull', 'sleeping?')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
While I should be sleeping

fish pulled out of the lake
Looking back while I should be sleeping

I’ll pull myself higher up
