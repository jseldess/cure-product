('pull', 'time.')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
Then I constellate my time family country

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
over the long time up in the sky

I’ll pull my data higher up
on the time line I was on

fish pulled out of the lake
I spend time online learning to code

I’ll pull myself higher up
over the time line I was on
