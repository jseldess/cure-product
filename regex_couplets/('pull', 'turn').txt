('pull', 'turn')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
in a sharp downward turn 

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
sudden downward turn

I’ll pull my data higher up
I keep turning back again myself

fish pulled out of the lake
I keep turning back

I’ll pull myself higher up
who knows how to turn it off
