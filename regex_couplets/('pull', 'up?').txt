('pull', 'up?')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
I’ll get there eventually

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
value falling off the edge of the face

I’ll pull my data higher up
and invaluable partner

I’ll pull my data
higher up in the internet

I’ll pull myself higher up
eventually 

fish pulled out of the lake
in a continuous vertiginous dream
