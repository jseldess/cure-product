('pull', 'us')

I’ll pull myself another personality type
asynchronous 

I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I’ll pull my data higher up
I want to cite a poem so usual

fish pulled out of the lake
in a continuous vertiginous dream

I’ll pull myself higher up
The ventillation rushes on
