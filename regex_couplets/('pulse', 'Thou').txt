('pulse', 'Thou')

impulse control
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I send and retrieve the impulse
Though we are waiting for her

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
Though we are breaking 

I stand and retrieve the impulse
Though we are waiting 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
Though we can’t help waiting

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
