('pulse', 'he')

impulse control
with my head

I send and retrieve the impulse
But my not feeling the memory aside

I stand and retrieve the impulse
where I send and relive aside

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
where I stand and relive

the impulse for my own prospects
where I end

the impulse for my own purposes
the impulse for my own purchases

the impulse to my purpose
where I stand and retrieve

aside the impulse to my purpose
where I stand aside and retrieve

the impulse my own prospects
where I send and retrieve aside

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
where I send and relive

impulse for my own purchases
where I stand aside

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
But my not feeling the memory inside

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
Selma helps too

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
the other end transactions
