('pulse', 'us')

impulse control
in a continuous vertiginous dream

I send and retrieve the impulse
trackers collecting data on users

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
in the form filled offered in trust

I stand and retrieve the impulse
useless for not having paid

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
radiating from housing
