conversations with our purchase
All of the time

in traversing my purchase
All that I can think I want

purchased out
COPY DREAM 

having been purchased out
Articles all around us

Having been purchased out of you
And we had to say goodbye to her there

for an ungraspable purchase
Articles all around stores in surfeit

And need out in front purchase
And read out in front

I tell you the weight of my purchases
And reached up the screen

until I purchase up the sky
And from that great distance

until I purchase the sky
And from a great distance

Is the weight of my purchases
SOCIAL

washed my purchases
A baby and a bear

for my own purchases
All parties would be held for my own purchases

CONTRACT

converting sight into a purchase
A way formerly like this one

the impulse for my own purchases
Aligned or not with my interests
