('purchase', 'For')

conversations with our purchase
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

in traversing my purchase
For an ungraspable time

And need out in front purchase
For an ungraspable purchase

Having been purchased out of you
For Mitt Romney

I have entered my purchases
For my own purchases

impulse for my own purchases
Formerly a way like this one

converting sight into a purchase
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
