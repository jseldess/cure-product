('purchase', 'IN')

conversations with our purchase
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

in traversing my purchase
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

purchased out
By NATASHA SINGER

washed my purchases
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

converting sight into a purchase
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

for my own purchases
