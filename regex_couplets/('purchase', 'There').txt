('purchase', 'There')

conversations with our purchase
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

in traversing my purchase
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

purchased out
There are spots waiting

until I purchase up in the sky
There are constant ways

converting sight into a purchase
