('purchase', 'Thou')

conversations with our purchase
Though there are quarters goals

in traversing my purchase
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

purchased out
Though we are waiting for her

I have entered my purchases
Though we are breaking 

For my own purchases
Though we are waiting 

converting sight into a purchase
Though we can’t help waiting

impulse for my own purchases
