('purchase', 'though')

conversations with our purchase
As though stationary and a destination

in traversing my purchase
though not many freeze up

purchased out
I thought

I have entered my purchases
though we are still breaking in

for my own purchases
though we are breaking in the space that it had

found dated for my own purchases
after though thereâ€™s no memory

converting sight into a purchase
though we are waiting for her

impulse for my own purchases
I answered what I thought

at the site of a purchase
