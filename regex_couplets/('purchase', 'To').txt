('purchase', 'To')

conversations with our purchase
To my children Walt Whitman

in traversing my purchase
Tomorrow

purchased out
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

I have entered my purchases
To the ends of transactions

converting sight into a purchase
To the ends of my transactions

for my own purchases
To the right of determined elections

at the site of a purchase
