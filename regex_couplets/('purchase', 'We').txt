('purchase', 'We')

conversations with our purchase
We can wrestle them with their goals

in traversing my purchase
We had to say goodbye there

And need out in front purchase
We had to buy there

For an ungraspable purchase
We had inhabited actually

I have entered my purchases
We ask say in that case

converting sight into a purchase
