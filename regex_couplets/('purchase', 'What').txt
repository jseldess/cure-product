('purchase', 'what')

conversations with our purchase
in light of learning what we see

in traversing my purchase
I even know what I would find

purchased out
what literally moved

converting sight into a purchase
I answered what I thought

for my own purchases
I answered what I thought about

at the site of a purchase
