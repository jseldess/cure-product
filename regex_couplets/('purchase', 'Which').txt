('purchase', 'Which')

conversations with our purchase
Which is a measure to never live out

in traversing my purchase
Which is a pleasure to never live out

purchased out
Which can be called confidence

I have entered my purchases
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

converting sight into a purchase
