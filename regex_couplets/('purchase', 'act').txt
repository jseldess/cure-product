('purchase', 'act')

conversations with our purchase
In the light of retroactive

in traversing my purchase
actually considering the end

purchased out
we had inhabited actually

I have entered my purchases
The ends of my transactions

for my own purchases
to the ends of my transactions

converting sight into a purchase
to the ends of actions

impulse for my own purchases
I turn not sad exactly

at the site of a purchase
before I act on them
