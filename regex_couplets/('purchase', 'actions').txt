('purchase', 'actions')

conversations with our purchase
conversations with our reactions

in traversing my purchase
to the ends of my transactions

I have entered my purchases
The ends of my transactions

for my own purchases
To the ends of transactions

converting sight into a purchase
to the ends of actions

impulse for my own purchases
