('purchase', 'agreed')

conversations with our purchase
and to which I’ve agreed

I have entered my purchases
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

found dated for my own purchases
and for which the plan agreed

converting sight into a purchase
that agreed one of rest

for my own purchases
that agreed home
