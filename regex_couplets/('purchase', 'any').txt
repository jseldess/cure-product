('purchase', 'any')

conversations with our purchase
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

in traversing my purchase
there wasn’t any television 

purchased out
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I tell you the weight of my purchases
without any further damage

I have entered my purchases
They have very many choices

washed my purchases
latency which doesn’t mean anything

converting sight into a purchase
The many transparent pixel calls

for my own purchases
or imagined anyway

at the site of a purchase
