('purchase', 'child')

conversations with our purchase
on a snow day with my children

in traversing my purchase
even my child

for an ungraspable purchase
Even the children

And need out in front purchase
my possession of my children

converting sight into a purchase
speech my possession of my children

for my own purchases
