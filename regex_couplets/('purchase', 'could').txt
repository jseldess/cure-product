('purchase', 'could')

conversations with our purchase
and could be mapped and weighed

in traversing my purchase
until I could not tire 

purchased out
I could consume the dream

having been purchased out
I could in effect credit

having been purchased out of you
and we could inhabit the room easy

I have entered my purchases
and could be inflected with reasons

converting sight into a purchase
