('purchase', 'eat')

conversations with our purchase
I reach repeated expressions first

in traversing my purchase
it was not just a defeat

purchased out
And from that great distance

until I purchase up the sky
And from a great distance

until I purchase the sky
was not just a defeat

I have entered my purchases
for the creation of the universe

converting sight into a purchase
burrowed about from repeated travels

at the site of a purchase
