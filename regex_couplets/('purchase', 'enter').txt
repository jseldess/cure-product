('purchase', 'enter')

conversations with our purchase
The sun high enough to enter directly 

in traversing my purchase
I enter the flattening mirror

purchased out
I have entered my purposes

I have entered my purchases
entered into my purposes

washed my purchases
I have entered my phone

for my own purchases
I had entered my phone

at the site of a purchase
