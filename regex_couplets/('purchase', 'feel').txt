('purchase', 'feel')

conversations with our purchase
conversations with our feelings

in traversing my purchase
What would I feel without that goal

purchased out
But my not feeling the memory aside

the impulse for my own purchases
But my not feeling the memory inside

for my own purchases
which feels most comfortable

converting sight into a purchase
By my feeling the memory inside

impulse for my own purchases
But my feeling the memory aside

at the site of a purchase
