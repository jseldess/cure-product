('purchase', 'form')

conversations with our purchase
There are performance reviews

in traversing my purchase
Toward the start informally given my reasons

purchased out
already formerly a long time

I have entered my purchases
A way formerly like this one

for my own purchases
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

found dated for my own purchases
already formely a long time

impulse for my own purchases
dawn formerly

converting sight into a purchase
formerly a way

the impulse for my own purchases
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

at the site of a purchase
own best form
