('purchase', 'grasp')

conversations with our purchase
having been graspable

purchased out
Under the grasp principle

having been purchased out
for an ungraspable purchase

And need out in front purchase
For an ungraspable time

Having been purchased out of you
And for an ungraspable time

I tell you the weight of my purchases
