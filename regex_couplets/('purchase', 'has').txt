('purchase', 'has')

conversations with our purchase
Before anyone has walked across the opening

in traversing my purchase
purchased out

having been purchased out
having been purchased out of you

for an ungraspable purchase
And need out in front purchase

I tell you the weight of my purchases
my purchase up in the sky

until I purchase up in the sky
until I purchase up the sky

until I purchase the sky
until my purchase up in the sky

Is the weight of my purchases
if that has anything

I have entered my purchases
the impulse for my own purchases

washed my purchases
for my own purchases

found dated for my own purchases
sound inundated for my own purchases

All parties would be held for my own purchases
impulse for my own purchases

converting sight into a purchase
He has turned it off

at the site of a purchase
phase decisioned by the prospect
