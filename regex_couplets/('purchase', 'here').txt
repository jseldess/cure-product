('purchase', 'here')

conversations with our purchase
Of course there is a direction

in traversing my purchase
Where I take my liesure

purchased out
And we had to say goodbye to her there

for an ungraspable purchase
We had to say goodbye there

And need out in front purchase
We had to buy there

Having been purchased out of you
where I need gravity

I tell you the weight of my purchases
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

until I purchase up the sky
There are spots waiting

until I purchase up in the sky
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

Is the weight of my purchases
One was up where it should be down

I have entered my purchases
where I send and relive aside

the impulse for my own purchases
where I stand aside

washed my purchases
elsewhere my purposes

for my own purchases
where I send and relive would be held

found dated for my own purchases
where I stand and relive

sound inundated for my own purchases
Where in me did I last

impulse for my own purchases
where I end

converting sight into a purchase
Is there a baby and a bear

at the site of a purchase
I learned the point where I am
