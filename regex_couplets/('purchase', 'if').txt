('purchase', 'if')

conversations with our purchase
if not directly on my skin

in traversing my purchase
If I take some different measure

purchased out
if there is anything 

I have entered my purchases
if you have providence

the impulse for my own purchases
if that has anything

converting sight into a purchase
if only on the way to the trash
