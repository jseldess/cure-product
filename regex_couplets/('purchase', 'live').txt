('purchase', 'live')

conversations with our purchase
Which is a measure to never live out

in traversing my purchase
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

purchased out
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I have entered my purchases
where I send and relive aside

the impulse for my own purchases
where I stand and retrieve relive

washed my purchases
where I send and relive would be held

found dated for my own purchases
where I stand and relive

sound inundated for my own purchases
where I send and relive

for my own purchases
where I send and retrieve relive

converting sight into a purchase
and relive from burrowed travels

at the site of a purchase
