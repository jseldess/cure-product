('purchase', 'man')

conversations with our purchase
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

in traversing my purchase
not many face up

purchased out
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

I have entered my purchases
They have very many choices

washed my purchases
and that man comes on to tell me 

converting sight into a purchase
The many transparent pixel calls

for my own purchases
