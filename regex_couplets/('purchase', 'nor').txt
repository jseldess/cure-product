('purchase', 'nor')

conversations with our purchase
into the minority proportion of time

in traversing my purchase
the simple act of honoring an accountant

purchased out
nor work in this way daily

I have entered my purchases
which had on honor to be told

converting sight into a purchase
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

for my own purchases
