('purchase', 'now')

conversations with our purchase
on a snow day with my children

in traversing my purchase
I take it out in the snow fall

purchased out
knowing the constituents

converting sight into a purchase
who knows how to turn it off

for my own purchases
who knows the way

impulse for my own purchases
that their knowing
