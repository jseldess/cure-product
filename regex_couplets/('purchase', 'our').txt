('purchase', 'our')

conversations with our purchase
conversations with our reactions

in traversing my purchase
You can hear it also through your leisure

purchased out
or alter of course the time anyway

I have entered my purchases
This is your chance

the impulse for my own purchases
Who throws contours away

converting sight into a purchase
phrase them of our possessions
