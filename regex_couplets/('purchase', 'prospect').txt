('purchase', 'prospect')

conversations with our purchase
the impulse for my own prospects

the impulse for my own purchases
the impulse my own prospects

impulse for my own purchases
stopping into the prospect

converting sight into a purchase
speech that is of by prospects

for my own purchases
The prospects there already
