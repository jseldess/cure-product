('purchase', 'purchases')

conversations with our purchase
I tell you the weight of my purchases

my purchase up in the sky
Is the weight of my purchases

I have entered my purchases
the impulse for my own purchases

washed my purchases
for my own purchases

found dated for my own purchases
sound inundated for my own purchases

All parties would be held for my own purchases
impulse for my own purchases

converting sight into a purchase
