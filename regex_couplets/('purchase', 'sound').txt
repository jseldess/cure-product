('purchase', 'sound')

conversations with our purchase
sound inundated for my own purchases

All parties would be held for my own purchases
and sound redundant

for my own purchases
for not paying sound overwhelmed

converting sight into a purchase
by in the sound privacy

impulse for my own purchases
buy in the sound privacy
