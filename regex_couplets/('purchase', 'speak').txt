('purchase', 'speak')

conversations with our purchase
not speaking

for my own purchases
without really speaking

found dated for my own purchases
I speak to them

impulse for my own purchases
would only speak willingly

converting sight into a purchase
I speak them of my possessions

the impulse for my own purchases
speak them of my possessions
