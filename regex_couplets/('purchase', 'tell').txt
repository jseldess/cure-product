('purchase', 'tell')

conversations with our purchase
Then I constellate my time family country

in traversing my purchase
So I constellate the time family country

purchased out
I tell you my purposes

I tell you the weight of my purchases
I tell you the weight of my purposes

Is the weight of my purchases
I tell you where I need gravity

I have entered my purchases
and that man comes on to tell me 

converting sight into a purchase
