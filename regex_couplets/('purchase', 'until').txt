('purchase', 'until')

conversations with our purchase
until my purpose up in the sky

in traversing my purchase
until I could not tire 

purchased out
until I purpose up in the sky

my purchase up in the sky
until I purchase up in the sky

I tell you the weight of my purchases
until I purchase up the sky

until I purchase the sky
until my purchase up in the sky

Is the weight of my purchases
until the bill came

I have entered my purchases
until a happier time found

converting sight into a purchase
