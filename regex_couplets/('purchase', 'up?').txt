('purchase', 'up?')

conversations with our purchase
such as I see

in traversing my purchase
If I take some different measure

purchased out
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

having been purchased out
black spots on a white surface

having been purchased out of you
Articles all around us

for an ungraspable purchase
My purpose up in the sky

And need out in front purchase
For an ungraspable time

I tell you the weight of my purchases
until I purpose up in the sky

my purchase up in the sky
until my purpose up in the sky

until I purchase up in the sky
While theyâ€™re up in the sky

until I purchase up the sky
around the dogs and lillies

until I purchase the sky
I spin around 

until my purchase up in the sky
my purchse up in the sky

Is the weight of my purchases
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I have entered my purchases
Then I saw into you

the impulse for my own purchases
the impulse to my purpose

washed my purchases
I have entered my purposes

for my own purchases
all parties would be helped

found dated for my own purchases
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

sound inundated for my own purchases
All parties would be held for my own purchases

impulse for my own purchases
the impulse for my own purposes

converting sight into a purchase
though we are waiting for her

at the site of a purchase
I returned to location
