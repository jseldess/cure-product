('purchase', 'us')

conversations with our purchase
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

in traversing my purchase
I reuse unassimilable visions

purchased out
Articles all around us

Having been purchased out of you
I wear suspenders

until I purchase up the sky
suspenders

until I purchase the sky
a futile joyous white sun

I have entered my purchases
trackers collecting data on users

washed my purchases
in the form filled offered in trust

For my own purchases
useless for not having paid

converting sight into a purchase
radiating from housing

at the site of a purchase
I have them trust in me
