('purchase', 'waiting')

conversations with our purchase
There are spots waiting

until I purchase up in the sky
Though we are waiting for her

I have entered my purchases
Though we are waiting 

converting sight into a purchase
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

for my own purchases
waiting out front or up above 

at the site of a purchase
