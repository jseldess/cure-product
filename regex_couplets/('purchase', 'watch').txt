('purchase', 'watch')

conversations with our purchase
when watching tv

in traversing my purchase
in the sense of watching

purchased out
I watch a movie

having been purchased out
I watch a moving afterimage

until I purchase up the sky
When I'm watching my tv 

converting sight into a purchase
where Iâ€™m watching my tv

at the site of a purchase
