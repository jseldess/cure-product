('purchase', 'you.')

conversations with our purchase
Though how can you know without direction

in traversing my purchase
where you can earn more 

purchased out
I tell you my purposes

I tell you the weight of my purchases
I tell you the weight of my purposes

Is the weight of my purchases
I tell you where I need gravity

I have entered my purchases
This is your chance

the impulse for my own purchases
the young ripples inaudibly

converting sight into a purchase
