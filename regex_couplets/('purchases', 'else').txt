('purchases', 'else')

I tell you the weight of my purchases
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

Is the weight of my purchases
and elsewhere my memory

I have entered my purchases
elsewhere my purposes

washed my purchases
elsewhere by my memory

for my own purchases
By my memory elsewhere

impulse for my own purchases
in memory elsewhere
