('purchases', 'form')

I tell you the weight of my purchases
already formerly a long time

I have entered my purchases
A way formerly like this one

for my own purchases
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

found dated for my own purchases
already formely a long time

impulse for my own purchases
dawn formerly

the impulse for my own purchases
drawn formerly rights ending themselves
