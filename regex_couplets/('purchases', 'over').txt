('purchases', 'over')

I tell you the weight of my purchases
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

I have entered my purchases
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

washed my purchases
for not paying sound overwhelmed

for my own purchases
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
