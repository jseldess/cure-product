('purchases', 'up?')

I tell you the weight of my purchases
until I purpose up in the sky

Is the weight of my purchases
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I have entered my purchases
Then I saw into you

the impulse for my own purchases
the impulse to my purpose

washed my purchases
I have entered my purposes

for my own purchases
all parties would be helped

found dated for my own purchases
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

sound inundated for my own purchases
All parties would be held for my own purchases

impulse for my own purchases
the impulse for my own purposes
