('pure', 'It')

an impure product
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

as pure as my children
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Between the face of pure joy and an interface.
It keeps coming down thankfully

What is an impure product
It has been since

as an impure product
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
