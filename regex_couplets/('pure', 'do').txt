('pure', 'do')

an impure product
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

as pure as my children
The dogs and lillies

Between the face of pure joy and an interface.
In a sharp downard turn

What is an impure product
It keeps coming down thankfully

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
does not feel an exception

as a pure product
drifting does not feel an exception

as an impure product
For whom drifting does not feel an exception
