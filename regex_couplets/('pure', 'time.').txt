('pure', 'time.')

an impure product
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

as pure as my children
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Between the face of pure joy and an interface.
only fragments of time with my children

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
where I sleep at times

as an impure product
at any time it can drift again

as a pure product
Then I constellate my time family country
