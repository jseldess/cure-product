('pure', 'us')

an impure product
asynchronous 

as pure as my children
because it was really dark

Between the face of pure joy and an interface.
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

as pure as my children Walt Whitman
slow asynchronous

as a pure product
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

as an impure product
I want to cite a poem so usual
