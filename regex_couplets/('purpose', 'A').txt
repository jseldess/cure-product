('purpose', 'A')

by no ventillation my purpose
After having been contented

until my purpose up in the sky
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

until I purpose the horizon
COPY DREAM 

In conversing of my purpose
As a clone, illegally conceived

My purpose up in the sky
Articles all around stores in surfeit

Until my purpose 
And need out in front purchase

I tell you my purposes
And for an ungraspable time

until I purpose up in the sky
And reached up the screen

I tell you the weight of my purposes
SOCIAL

weight of my purposes
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Where I host my purposes
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

elsewhere my purposes
A baby and a bear

the impulse for my own purposes
CONTRACT

to the other end of my purpose
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

the impulse to my purpose
Aligned or not with my interests

for my own purposes
