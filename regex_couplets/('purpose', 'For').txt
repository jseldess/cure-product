('purpose', 'For')

by no ventillation my purpose
Forecasting the story before dawn

until my purpose up in the sky
For an ungraspable time

Until my purpose 
For an ungraspable purchase

I tell you my purposes
For Mitt Romney

I have entered my purposes
For my own purchases

the impulse for my own purposes
Formerly a way like this one

to the other end of my purpose
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
