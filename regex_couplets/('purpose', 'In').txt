('purpose', 'IN')

by no ventillation my purpose
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

until my purpose up in the sky
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

until I purpose the horizon
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

My purpose up in the sky
By NATASHA SINGER

elsewhere my purposes
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

to the other end of my purpose
