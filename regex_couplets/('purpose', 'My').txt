('purpose', 'My')

by no ventillation my purpose
My associations

until I purpose the horizon
My purpose up in the sky

Until my purpose 
My means without gravity

Where I host my purposes
My daughter with her way

to the other end of my purpose
My say to the elections

for my own purposes
My state kept loaned impression
