('purpose', 'so')

by no ventillation my purpose
reasons resources

until my purpose up in the sky
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

until I purpose the horizon
If I take some different measure

of my purpose in versing
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I tell you my purposes
so that nothing had gravity

Where I host my purposes
More reasons around my country 

I have entered my purposes
sound inundated for my own purchases

the impulse for my own purposes
and sound redundant

the impulse to my purpose
firing and connecting somewhere

to the other end of my purpose
by in the sound privacy

aside the impulse to my purpose
also didnâ€™t really move

for my own purposes
buy in the sound privacy
