('purpose', 'There')

by no ventillation my purpose
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

until my purpose up in the sky
There was very little physical activity

until I purpose the horizon
There are spots waiting

I tell you my purposes
There are constant ways

to the other end of my purpose
