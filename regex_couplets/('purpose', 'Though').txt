('purpose', 'though')

by no ventillation my purpose
though it was most emphatically that

until my purpose up in the sky
I had nightmares though

until I purpose the horizon
I thought

Where I host my purposes
though we are still breaking in

the impulse for my own purposes
after though thereâ€™s no memory

to the other end of my purpose
I answered what I thought

the impulse to my purpose
I answered what I thought about

for my own purposes
