('purpose', 'To')

by no ventillation my purpose
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

until my purpose up in the sky
Tomorrow

until I purpose the horizon
To neither study

I have entered my purposes
To the ends of transactions

to the other end of my purpose
To the right of determined elections

for my own purposes
