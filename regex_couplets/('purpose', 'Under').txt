('purpose', 'under')

by no ventillation my purpose
under pillowing a cloud

of my purpose in versing
under the last seen principle

In conversing of my purpose
she lay under the grass

My purpose up in the sky
under the grasp principle

Until my purpose 
designed to hold up my underwear

I tell you my purposes
