('purpose', 'Where')

by no ventillation my purpose
Where official policy is to catch and release

until my purpose up in the sky
Where I take my liesure

until I purpose the horizon
Where I lead gravity

I tell you my purposes
Where I need gravity

I tell you the weight of my purposes
Where in me did I host

Where I host my purposes
Where in me did I last

the impulse for my own purposes
Where in me did I lose

to the other end of my purpose
