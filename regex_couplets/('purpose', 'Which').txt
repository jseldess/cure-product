('purpose', 'Which')

by no ventillation my purpose
Which can be pronounced to the world

until my purpose up in the sky
Which is a pleasure to never live out

until I purpose the horizon
Which can be called confidence

I have entered my purposes
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

to the other end of my purpose
