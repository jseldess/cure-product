('purpose', 'act')

by no ventillation my purpose
I was enjoined to act again

until my purpose up in the sky
and strategies not tactics

until I purpose the horizon
we had inhabited actually

Where I host my purposes
The ends of my transactions

the impulse for my own purposes
to the ends of my transactions

to the other end of my purpose
to the other end of transactions

the impulse to my purpose
I turn not sad exactly

for my own purposes
I return not sad exactly
