('purpose', 'agreed')

by no ventillation my purpose
and to which I’ve agreed

Where I host my purposes
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

the impulse for my own purposes
and for which the plan agreed

to the other end of my purpose
that agreed one of rest

the impulse to my purpose
that agreed home
