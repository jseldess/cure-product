('purpose', 'already')

by no ventillation my purpose
already formerly a long time

Where I host my purposes
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

the impulse for my own purposes
already formely a long time

the impulse to my purpose
with dawn already formerly nights 

to the other end of my purpose
So I presume the offers already
