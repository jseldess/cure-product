('purpose', 'any')

by no ventillation my purpose
Or the company

until my purpose up in the sky
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

until I purpose the horizon
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

My purpose up in the sky
there wasn’t any television 

I tell you my purposes
without any further damage

Where I host my purposes
They have very many choices

elsewhere my purposes
latency which doesn’t mean anything

to the other end of my purpose
or imagined anyway

for my own purposes
