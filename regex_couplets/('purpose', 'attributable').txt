('purpose', 'attributable')

by no ventillation my purpose
I resume attributable visions

until I purpose the horizon
attributable visions

in traversing my purpose
visions that can be attributable

of my purpose in versing
that decisions can be attributable

to the other end of my purpose
decisions that can be attributable
