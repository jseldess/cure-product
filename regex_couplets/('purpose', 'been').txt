('purpose', 'been')

by no ventillation my purpose
After having been contented

until my purpose up in the sky
that having been after content

until I purpose the horizon
having been graspable

in traversing my purpose
having been an ungraspable time

My purpose up in the sky
Having been purchased out of you

I tell you my purposes
