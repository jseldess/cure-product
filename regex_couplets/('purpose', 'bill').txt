('purpose', 'bill')

by no ventillation my purpose
I hear it between bills and stuff

until my purpose up in the sky
I can hear it between bills and stuff

until I purpose the horizon
billowing in the cloud

of my purpose in versing
until the bill came

Where I host my purposes
the bill my detuning 

for my own purposes
between bills and stuffed animals
