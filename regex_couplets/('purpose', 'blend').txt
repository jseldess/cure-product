('purpose', 'blend')

by no ventillation my purpose
walking into percents blending themselves

of my purpose in versing
where I blend and relive

to the other end of my purpose
where lights blended themselves

the impulse for my own purposes
battery dawn nights blending themselves

for my own purposes
