('purpose', 'but')

by no ventillation my purpose
Attributable or

until my purpose up in the sky
but the sun isnâ€™t up

until I purpose the horizon
I resume attributable visions

of my purpose in versing
attributable visions

in traversing my purpose
visions that can be attributable

of my purpose in conversing
that decisions can be attributable

to the other end of my purpose
but for memory elsewhere

for my own purposes
decisions that can be attributable
