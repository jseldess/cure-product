('purpose', 'call')

by no ventillation my purpose
though it was most emphatically that

until my purpose up in the sky
They are called aspirational

until I purpose the horizon
Which can be called confidence

I have entered my purposes
to take the call

to the other end of my purpose
recalling aside

for my own purposes
