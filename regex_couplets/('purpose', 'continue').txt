('purpose', 'continue')

by no ventillation my purpose
but it continued

until I purpose the horizon
I continue to presume

in traversing my purpose
I continue to subsume

of my purpose in conversing
I continue to consume

My purpose up in the sky
Then I continue to dream then

I tell you my purposes
I continued to dream then

Where I host my purposes
