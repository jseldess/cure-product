('purpose', 'could')

by no ventillation my purpose
and could be mapped and weighed

until my purpose up in the sky
until I could not tire 

until I purpose the horizon
I could in effect credit

in traversing my purpose
I could consume the dream

My purpose up in the sky
and we could inhabit the room easy

Where I host my purposes
and could be inflected with reasons
