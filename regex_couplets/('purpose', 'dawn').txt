('purpose', 'dawn')

by no ventillation my purpose
Forecasting the story before dawn

until my purpose up in the sky
battery dawn nights blending themselves

of my purpose in versing
dawn already formerly nights 

Where I host my purposes
dawn formerly

to the other end of my purpose
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

the impulse for my own purposes
battery dawn nights ending themselves

for my own purposes
