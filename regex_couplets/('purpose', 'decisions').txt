('purpose', 'decisions')

by no ventillation my purpose
the planning process for decisions

until I purpose the horizon
attributable decisions

in traversing my purpose
decisions that can be attributable

of my purpose in versing
forgetting decisions 

to the other end of my purpose
that decisions can be attributable

the impulse for my own purposes
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
