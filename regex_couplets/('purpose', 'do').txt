('purpose', 'do')

by no ventillation my purpose
The dogs and lillies

until my purpose up in the sky
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

until I purpose the horizon
What I do in my liesure

of my purpose in versing
here is the site of the battle of maldon

My purpose up in the sky
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I tell you my purposes
around the dogs and lillies

I tell you the weight of my purposes
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

weight of my purposes
and it doesn’t take long

to the other end of my purpose
I only think I don’t listen
