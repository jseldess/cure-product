('purpose', 'eat')

by no ventillation my purpose
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

until my purpose up in the sky
of the habits I create

until I purpose the horizon
And from that great distance

I tell you my purposes
And from a great distance

my purpose up in the sky
was not just a defeat

I have entered my purposes
for the creation of the universe

to the other end of my purpose
burrowed about from repeated travels

for my own purposes
