('purpose', 'else')

by no ventillation my purpose
If you have confidence regardless all else

until my purpose up in the sky
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I tell you my purposes
and elsewhere my memory

I have entered my purposes
and elsewhere my memory of you

the impulse for my own purposes
elsewhere my purposes

the impulse to my purpose
elsewhere by my memory

to the other end of my purpose
By my memory elsewhere

aside the impulse to my purpose
in memory elsewhere

for my own purposes
