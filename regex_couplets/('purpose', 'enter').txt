('purpose', 'enter')

by no ventillation my purpose
The sun high enough to enter directly 

until I purpose the horizon
I enter the flattening mirror

of my purpose in versing
I have entered my purposes

the impulse for my own purposes
I have entered my purchases

entered into my purposes
I have entered my phone

elsewhere my purposes
I had entered my phone

for my own purposes
