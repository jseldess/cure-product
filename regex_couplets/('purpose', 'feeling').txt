('purpose', 'feeling')

by no ventillation my purpose
But my not feeling the memory aside

the impulse for my own purposes
But my not feeling the memory inside

the impulse to my purpose
By my feeling the memory inside

to the other end of my purpose
But my feeling the memory aside

for my own purposes
