('purpose', 'form')

by no ventillation my purpose
Toward the start informally given my reasons

until I purpose the horizon
already formerly a long time

Where I host my purposes
A way formerly like this one

the impulse for my own purposes
already formely a long time

the impulse to my purpose
dawn formerly

to the other end of my purpose
formerly my way 

aside the impulse to my purpose
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

for my own purposes
which I feel formerly about for
