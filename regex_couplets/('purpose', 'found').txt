('purpose', 'found')

by no ventillation my purpose
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

elsewhere my purposes
found dated for my own purchases

the impulse for my own purposes
and found inundated

the impulse to my purpose
and found redundant

to the other end of my purpose
So I found myself at home
