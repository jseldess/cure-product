('purpose', 'get')

by no ventillation my purpose
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

until my purpose up in the sky
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

until I purpose the horizon
I get through there

of my purpose in conversing
I get from here through there

in conversing of my purpose
in traversing get through there

in traversing my purpose
I get here through there

in pursuing my purpose
forgetting decisions 

to the other end of my purpose
forgettable
