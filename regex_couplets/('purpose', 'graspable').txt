('purpose', 'graspable')

by no ventillation my purpose
having been graspable

in traversing my purpose
having been an ungraspable time

My purpose up in the sky
For an ungraspable time

Until my purpose 
For an ungraspable purchase

I tell you my purposes
And for an ungraspable time

until I purpose up in the sky
