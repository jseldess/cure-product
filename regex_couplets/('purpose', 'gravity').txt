('purpose', 'gravity')

by no ventillation my purpose
and testing the edge and gravity

until I purpose the horizon
where I need gravity

I tell you my purposes
Where I lead gravity

my purpose up in the sky
I tell you where I need gravity

I tell you the weight of my purposes
that nothing had gravity

Where I host my purposes
