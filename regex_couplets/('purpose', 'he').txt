('purpose', 'he')

by no ventillation my purpose
I am the first in the office

until my purpose up in the sky
Then I cannot see face value

until I purpose the horizon
the clouds hinged the horizon

of my purpose in versing
I get through there

of my purpose in conversing
in the sense of watching

in traversing my purpose
in the long time they were on

in conversing of my purpose
in pursuit of the sight

in pursuing my purpose
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

My purpose up in the sky
under the grasp principle

Until my purpose 
Even the children

I tell you my purposes
they can be waived

until I purpose up in the sky
While weâ€™re up in the sky

I tell you the weight of my purposes
They can be weighed

weight of my purposes
I tell you the weight of my purchases

Where I host my purposes
and elsewhere my memory

I have entered my purposes
and elsewhere my memory of you

the impulse for my own purposes
the impulse for my own purchases

the impulse to my purpose
where I stand and retrieve

aside the impulse to my purpose
where I stand aside and retrieve

entered into my purposes
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

elsewhere my purposes
washed my purchases

to the other end of my purpose
But my not feeling the memory inside

for my own purposes
I stay the right of my elections
