('purpose', 'her')

by no ventillation my purpose
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

until my purpose up in the sky
there was no promotion

until I purpose the horizon
I get through there

of my purpose in conversing
I get from here through there

in conversing of my purpose
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

in traversing my purpose
I get here through there

in pursuing my purpose
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

My purpose up in the sky
We had to say goodbye there

Until my purpose 
 of those gathered

I tell you my purposes
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I tell you the weight of my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity

weight of my purposes
without any further damage

Where I host my purposes
and elsewhere my memory

I have entered my purposes
and elsewhere my memory of you

the impulse for my own purposes
where I stand aside

the impulse to my purpose
where I stand and retrieve

aside the impulse to my purpose
where I stand aside and retrieve

entered into my purposes
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

elsewhere my purposes
Though we are waiting for her

to the other end of my purpose
to the other end of transactions

for my own purposes
I learned the point where I am
