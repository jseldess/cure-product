('purpose', 'here')

by no ventillation my purpose
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

until my purpose up in the sky
there was no promotion

until I purpose the horizon
I get through there

of my purpose in conversing
I get from here through there

in conversing of my purpose
in traversing get through there

in traversing my purpose
I get here through there

in pursuing my purpose
here is the site of the battle of maldon

My purpose up in the sky
We had to say goodbye there

Until my purpose 
 of those gathered

I tell you my purposes
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I tell you the weight of my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity

weight of my purposes
Where in me did I host

Where I host my purposes
and elsewhere my memory

I have entered my purposes
and elsewhere my memory of you

the impulse for my own purposes
where I stand aside

the impulse to my purpose
where I stand and retrieve

aside the impulse to my purpose
where I stand aside and retrieve

entered into my purposes
elsewhere my purposes

to the other end of my purpose
where rights ended themselves

for my own purposes
I learned the point where I am
