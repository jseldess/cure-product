('purpose', 'if')

by no ventillation my purpose
if you have providence to excess

until my purpose up in the sky
learned without too much difficulty to code

until I purpose the horizon
If I take a different measure

of my purpose in versing
If I take some different measure

of my purpose in conversing
if there is anything 

Where I host my purposes
if you have providence

the impulse for my own purposes
if that has anything

to the other end of my purpose
if only on the way to the trash
