('purpose', 'inter')

by no ventillation my purpose
hold at intervals riding forward

until my purpose up in the sky
with internally regulated climate

until I purpose the horizon
Then I saw them interview

the impulse for my own purposes
my interfaced stand data

for my own purposes
aligned or not with my interests
