('purpose', 'last')

by no ventillation my purpose
What was the last time

until I purpose the horizon
under the last seen principle

In conversing of my purpose
Under the last principle 

My purpose up in the sky
Under the last principle of purchasing power

I tell you my purposes
Where in me did I last

the impulse for my own purposes
last night

to the other end of my purpose
