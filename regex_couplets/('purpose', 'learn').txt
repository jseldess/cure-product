('purpose', 'learn')

by no ventillation my purpose
I spend time online learning to code

until my purpose up in the sky
learned without too much difficulty to code

until I purpose the horizon
decisioned to learn 

to the other end of my purpose
decisioned to learn back

the impulse for my own purposes
I learned my location

for my own purposes
phase decision for learning
