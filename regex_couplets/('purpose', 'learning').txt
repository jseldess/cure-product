('purpose', 'learning')

by no ventillation my purpose
I spend time online learning to code

until my purpose up in the sky
Then I am learning to code

until I purpose the horizon
phase decision for learning

to the other end of my purpose
for learning by the prospect

the impulse for my own purposes
a precision for learning
