('purpose', 'live')

by no ventillation my purpose
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

until my purpose up in the sky
Which is a pleasure to never live out

until I purpose the horizon
where I send and relive aside

the impulse for my own purposes
where I stand and retrieve relive

Where I host my purposes
where I send and relive would be held

the impulse to my purpose
where I stand and relive

to the other end of my purpose
where I send and relive

aside the impulse to my purpose
where I send and retrieve relive

for my own purposes
