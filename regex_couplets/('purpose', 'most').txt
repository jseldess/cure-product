('purpose', 'most')

by no ventillation my purpose
though it was most emphatically that

until my purpose up in the sky
I invited most of what came next

until I purpose the horizon
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

elsewhere my purposes
which feels most comfortable

to the other end of my purpose
mostly along cables

for my own purposes
