('purpose', 'move')

by no ventillation my purpose
since I can imagine movement

until I purpose the horizon
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

My purpose up in the sky
and literally moved

Where I host my purposes
myself moved literally as it is

to the other end of my purpose
not literally moved about

the impulse for my own purposes
also didnâ€™t really move

for my own purposes
Not literally moved
