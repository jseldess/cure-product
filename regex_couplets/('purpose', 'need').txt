('purpose', 'need')

by no ventillation my purpose
I need the work

until I purpose the horizon
And need out in front purchase

Until my purpose 
where I need gravity

I tell you my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity

I tell you the weight of my purposes
not needing to wait

to the other end of my purpose
in need one in that best own

the impulse for my own purposes
need one in best own
