('purpose', 'no')

by no ventillation my purpose
I am told by no ventillation

until my purpose up in the sky
Then I cannot see face value

until I purpose the horizon
even when close to my knowing

of my purpose in conversing
When closed to my knowing

in conversing of my purpose
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

My purpose up in the sky
I used my technology

I tell you my purposes
that nothing had gravity

Where I host my purposes
and other types of tracking technology

I have entered my purposes
which we can pronounce

the impulse for my own purposes
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

elsewhere my purposes
not speaking

the impulse to my purpose
from no one point

to the other end of my purpose
But my not feeling the memory inside

aside the impulse to my purpose
But my not feeling the memory aside

for my own purposes
I return not sad exactly
