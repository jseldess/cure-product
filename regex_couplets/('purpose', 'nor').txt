('purpose', 'nor')

by no ventillation my purpose
over the long line I would honor

until my purpose up in the sky
nor work in this way daily

until I purpose the horizon
nor envy honest work

I have entered my purposes
which had on honor to be told

to the other end of my purpose
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

the impulse for my own purposes
