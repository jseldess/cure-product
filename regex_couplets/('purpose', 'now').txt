('purpose', 'now')

by no ventillation my purpose
out in the snow

until my purpose up in the sky
out in the snow fall

until I purpose the horizon
even when close to my knowing

of my purpose in conversing
When closed to my knowing

in conversing of my purpose
knowing the constituents

to the other end of my purpose
who knows the way

the impulse for my own purposes
that their knowing
