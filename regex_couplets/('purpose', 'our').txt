('purpose', 'our')

by no ventillation my purpose
reasons resources

until my purpose up in the sky
with four key value pairs

until I purpose the horizon
or alter of course the time anyway

Where I host my purposes
This is your voice 

I have entered my purposes
This is your chance

the impulse for my own purposes
Who throws contours away

to the other end of my purpose
phrase them of our possessions
