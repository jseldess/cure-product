('purpose', 'over')

by no ventillation my purpose
over the long line up in the sky

until my purpose up in the sky
over the time line I was on

until I purpose the horizon
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

My purpose up in the sky
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

Where I host my purposes
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

elsewhere my purposes
for not paying sound overwhelmed

to the other end of my purpose
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
