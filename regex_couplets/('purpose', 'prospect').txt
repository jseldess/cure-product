('purpose', 'prospect')

by no ventillation my purpose
the impulse for my own prospects

the impulse for my own purposes
the impulse my own prospects

the impulse to my purpose
stopping into the prospect

to the other end of my purpose
speech that is of by prospects

aside the impulse to my purpose
The prospects there already
