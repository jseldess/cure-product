('purpose', 'pulse')

by no ventillation my purpose
impulse control

until my purpose up in the sky
I send and retrieve the impulse

the impulse for my own purposes
the impulse for my own purchases

the impulse to my purpose
aside the impulse to my purpose

Where I host my purposes
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

to the other end of my purpose
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

for my own purposes
