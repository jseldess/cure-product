('purpose', 'purchase')

by no ventillation my purpose
in traversing my purchase

until I purpose the horizon
purchased out

My purpose up in the sky
And need out in front purchase

Until my purpose 
For an ungraspable purchase

I tell you my purposes
I tell you the weight of my purchases

until I purpose up in the sky
my purchase up in the sky

until my purpose up in the sky
until I purchase up in the sky

I tell you the weight of my purposes
Is the weight of my purchases

weight of my purposes
I have entered my purchases

the impulse for my own purposes
the impulse for my own purchases

the impulse to my purpose
washed my purchases

I have entered my purposes
for my own purchases

aside the impulse to my purpose
converting sight into a purchase

to the other end of my purpose
impulse for my own purchases

for my own purposes
at the site of a purchase
