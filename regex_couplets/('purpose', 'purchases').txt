('purpose', 'purchases')

by no ventillation my purpose
I tell you the weight of my purchases

until I purpose up in the sky
Is the weight of my purchases

I tell you my purposes
I have entered my purchases

the impulse for my own purposes
the impulse for my own purchases

the impulse to my purpose
washed my purchases

I have entered my purposes
for my own purchases

aside the impulse to my purpose
impulse for my own purchases

for my own purposes
