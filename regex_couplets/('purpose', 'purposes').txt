('purpose', 'purposes')

by no ventillation my purpose
I tell you my purposes

until I purpose up in the sky
I tell you the weight of my purposes

weight of my purposes
Where I host my purposes

I have entered my purposes
the impulse for my own purposes

the impulse to my purpose
entered into my purposes

elsewhere my purposes
for my own purposes
