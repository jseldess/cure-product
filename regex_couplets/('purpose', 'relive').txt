('purpose', 'relive')

by no ventillation my purpose
where I send and relive aside

the impulse for my own purposes
where I stand and retrieve relive

Where I host my purposes
where I send and relive would be held

the impulse to my purpose
where I stand and relive

to the other end of my purpose
where I send and relive

aside the impulse to my purpose
where I send and retrieve relive

for my own purposes
