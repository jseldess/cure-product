('purpose', 'resume')

by no ventillation my purpose
I resume unassimilable visions

until I purpose the horizon
I resume attributable visions

of my purpose in versing
I continue to presume

in traversing my purpose
I presume to others

to the other end of my purpose
So I presume the offers already
