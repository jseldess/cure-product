('purpose', 'ring')

by no ventillation my purpose
ring

until my purpose up in the sky
actually considering the end

until I purpose the horizon
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

of my purpose in versing
storing in surfeit

My purpose up in the sky
firing and connecting somewhere

to the other end of my purpose
The prospect for veering healthily
