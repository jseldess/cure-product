('purpose', 'say')

by no ventillation my purpose
we had to say goodbye

My purpose up in the sky
We had to say goodbye there

Until my purpose 
And we had to say goodbye to her there

I tell you my purposes
I ask say in that case

to the other end of my purpose
formerly along my say to the elections

the impulse for my own purposes
My say to the elections

for my own purposes
We ask say in that case
