('purpose', 'send')

by no ventillation my purpose
I send and retrieve the impulse

the impulse for my own purposes
where I send and relive would be held

the impulse to my purpose
where I send and retrieve relive

to the other end of my purpose
where I send and relive

aside the impulse to my purpose
where I send and receive

for my own purposes
