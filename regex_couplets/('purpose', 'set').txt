('purpose', 'set')

by no ventillation my purpose
upset by Gingrich

until my purpose up in the sky
in front of the set afternoon

until I purpose the horizon
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

Where I host my purposes
Um, upset by Gingrich

I have entered my purposes
presets
