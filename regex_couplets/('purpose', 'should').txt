('purpose', 'should')

by no ventillation my purpose
While I should be sleeping

until my purpose up in the sky
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

I tell you my purposes
One was up where it should be down

I tell you the weight of my purposes
they should rise up

the impulse for my own purposes
