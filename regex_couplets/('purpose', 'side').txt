('purpose', 'side')

by no ventillation my purpose
aside from the retinas

until I purpose the horizon
But my not feeling the memory aside

the impulse for my own purposes
where I stand aside

the impulse to my purpose
aside the impulse to my purpose

Where I host my purposes
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

to the other end of my purpose
But my not feeling the memory inside

for my own purposes
