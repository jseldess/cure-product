('purpose', 'sound')

by no ventillation my purpose
sound inundated for my own purchases

the impulse for my own purposes
and sound redundant

the impulse to my purpose
for not paying sound overwhelmed

to the other end of my purpose
by in the sound privacy

aside the impulse to my purpose
buy in the sound privacy
