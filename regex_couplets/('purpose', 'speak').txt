('purpose', 'speak')

by no ventillation my purpose
not speaking

the impulse for my own purposes
without really speaking

the impulse to my purpose
would only speak willingly

to the other end of my purpose
I speak them of my possessions

aside the impulse to my purpose
speak them of my possessions
