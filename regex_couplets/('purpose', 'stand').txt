('purpose', 'stand')

by no ventillation my purpose
hovering above standing water

until my purpose up in the sky
I stand and retrieve the impulse

the impulse for my own purposes
where I stand aside

the impulse to my purpose
where I stand and retrieve

aside the impulse to my purpose
where I stand aside and retrieve

Where I host my purposes
where I stand and relive

to the other end of my purpose
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

for my own purposes
I learned the point of standing
