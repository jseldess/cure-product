('purpose', 'tell')

by no ventillation my purpose
So I constellate the time family country

until my purpose up in the sky
I had to tell them the news

until I purpose the horizon
I tell you my purposes

until I purpose up in the sky
I tell you the weight of my purchases

my purpose up in the sky
I tell you the weight of my purposes

weight of my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity

Where I host my purposes
and that man comes on to tell me 

to the other end of my purpose
