('purpose', 'themselves')

by no ventillation my purpose
talking into pheasants bending themselves

until I purpose the horizon
talking into percents bending themselves

of my purpose in versing
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

to the other end of my purpose
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

the impulse for my own purposes
battery dawn nights blending themselves

for my own purposes
