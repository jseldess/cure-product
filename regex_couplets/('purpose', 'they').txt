('purpose', 'They')

by no ventillation my purpose
They are called aspirational

until I purpose the horizon
They can be waived

I tell you the weight of my purposes
They can be weighed

I tell you my purposes
They have very many choices

elsewhere my purposes
They were filters

for my own purposes
