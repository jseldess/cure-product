('purpose', 'through')

by no ventillation my purpose
You can hear it also through your leisure

until my purpose up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

until I purpose the horizon
I get through there

of my purpose in conversing
I get from here through there

in conversing of my purpose
in traversing get through there

in traversing my purpose
I get here through there

in pursuing my purpose
