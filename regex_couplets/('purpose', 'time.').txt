('purpose', 'time.')

by no ventillation my purpose
over the time line I was on

until my purpose up in the sky
over the long time up in the sky

until I purpose the horizon
without the long time I was accounting

of my purpose in versing
the long time I was on

in traversing my purpose
in the long time they were on

in conversing of my purpose
or alter of course the time anyway

Where I host my purposes
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

elsewhere my purposes
until a happier time found

to the other end of my purpose
formerly along time they were on

the impulse for my own purposes
time they were on

for my own purposes
