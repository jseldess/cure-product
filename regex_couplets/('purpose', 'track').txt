('purpose', 'track')

by no ventillation my purpose
I reuse indelible tracks 

until I purpose the horizon
and other types of tracking technology

I have entered my purposes
trackers collecting data on users

entered into my purposes
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

elsewhere my purposes
which as tracked befitted 

to the other end of my purpose
which as tracked befitted phased

the impulse for my own purposes
sizes track for asking sound
