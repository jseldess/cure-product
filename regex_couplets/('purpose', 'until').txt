('purpose', 'until')

by no ventillation my purpose
until my purpose up in the sky

until I purpose the horizon
until I purpose up in the sky

My purpose up in the sky
until I purchase up the sky

I tell you my purposes
until I purchase the sky

I tell you the weight of my purposes
until the bill came

Where I host my purposes
until a happier time found

to the other end of my purpose
