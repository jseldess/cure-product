('purpose', 'up?')

by no ventillation my purpose
to be before the sun

until my purpose up in the sky
Then I cannot see face value

until I purpose the horizon
the clouds hinged the horizon

of my purpose in versing
versing my circuit

of my purpose in conversing
I could in effect credit

in traversing my purpose
If I take some different measure

in conversing of my purpose
in pursuing my purpose

My purpose up in the sky
Sweets and coffee and juice

Until my purpose 
For an ungraspable time

I tell you my purposes
And for an ungraspable time

until I purpose up in the sky
While weâ€™re up in the sky

I tell you the weight of my purposes
weight of my purposes

Where I host my purposes
The South Carolina primary 

I have entered my purposes
and elsewhere my memory of you

the impulse for my own purposes
the impulse for my own purchases

the impulse to my purpose
aside the impulse to my purpose

entered into my purposes
data collection on users

elsewhere my purposes
washed my purchases

to the other end of my purpose
But my not feeling the memory inside

for my own purposes
I return not sad exactly
