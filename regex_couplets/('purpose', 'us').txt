('purpose', 'us')

by no ventillation my purpose
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

until my purpose up in the sky
The ventillation rushes on

until I purpose the horizon
I have them trust in me

in conversing of my purpose
a futile joyous white sun

My purpose up in the sky
articles all around us

Until my purpose 
I wear suspenders

I tell you my purposes
I used my technology

I tell you the weight of my purposes
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

Where I host my purposes
was not just a defeat

I have entered my purposes
trackers collecting data on users

entered into my purposes
data collection on users

elsewhere my purposes
in the form filled offered in trust

the impulse for my own purposes
useless for not having paid

to the other end of my purpose
radiating from housing

for my own purposes
