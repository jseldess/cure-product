('purpose', 'use')

by no ventillation my purpose
You use the most essential parts

until my purpose up in the sky
I reuse unassimilable visions

until I purpose the horizon
I used my technology

I tell you my purposes
trackers collecting data on users

entered into my purposes
data collection on users

elsewhere my purposes
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

the impulse for my own purposes
useless for not having paid

to the other end of my purpose
