('purpose', 'vision')

by no ventillation my purpose
I had me a vision

until my purpose up in the sky
The planning process for visions

until I purpose the horizon
I had a vision

of my purpose in versing
I resume attributable visions

in traversing my purpose
attributable visions

of my purpose in conversing
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

My purpose up in the sky
there wasnâ€™t any television 

I tell you my purposes
joined in my television

for my own purposes
visions that can be attainable
