('purpose', 'visions')

by no ventillation my purpose
The planning process for visions

until I purpose the horizon
I resume attributable visions

of my purpose in versing
attributable visions

in traversing my purpose
visions that can be attributable

of my purpose in conversing
visions that can be attainable
