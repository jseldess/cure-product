('purpose', 'watch')

by no ventillation my purpose
when watching tv

until I purpose the horizon
in the sense of watching

of my purpose in versing
always watching

in traversing my purpose
I watch a movie

In conversing of my purpose
I watch a moving afterimage

My purpose up in the sky
When I'm watching my tv 

to the other end of my purpose
where Iâ€™m watching my tv

for my own purposes
