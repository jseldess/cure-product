('purpose', 'were')

by no ventillation my purpose
When we had jobs that were to earn

until my purpose up in the sky
I argued the days were longer

until I purpose the horizon
they were on

in traversing my purpose
in the long time they were on

in conversing of my purpose
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

Where I host my purposes
answered about 

to the other end of my purpose
I answered what I thought

the impulse for my own purposes
I answered about

for my own purposes
that they were visible
