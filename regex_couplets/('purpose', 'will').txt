('purpose', 'will')

by no ventillation my purpose
will not be the same

until I purpose the horizon
that will spur me on

in conversing of my purpose
that will try me on 

of my purpose in conversing
would only willingly break

to the other end of my purpose
my daughter will learn 

the impulse for my own purposes
