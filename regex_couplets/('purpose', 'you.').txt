('purpose', 'you.')

by no ventillation my purpose
You can hear it also through your leisure

until my purpose up in the sky
That you can see only the back of

until I purpose the horizon
a futile joyous white sun

My purpose up in the sky
I tell you my purposes

until I purpose up in the sky
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I tell you the weight of my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity

weight of my purposes
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

Where I host my purposes
This is your voice 

I have entered my purposes
This is your chance

the impulse for my own purposes
the young ripples inaudibly
