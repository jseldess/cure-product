('purposes', 'A')

I tell you my purposes
And for an ungraspable time

I tell you the weight of my purposes
SOCIAL

weight of my purposes
As a clone, illegally conceived

Where I host my purposes
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

elsewhere my purposes
A baby and a bear

the impulse for my own purposes
CONTRACT

for my own purposes
Aligned or not with my interests
