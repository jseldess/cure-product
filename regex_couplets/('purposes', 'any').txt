('purposes', 'any')

I tell you my purposes
there wasn’t any television 

I tell you the weight of my purposes
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

weight of my purposes
without any further damage

Where I host my purposes
They have very many choices

elsewhere my purposes
latency which doesn’t mean anything

the impulse for my own purposes
or imagined anyway

for my own purposes
