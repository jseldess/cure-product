('purposes', 'do')

I tell you my purposes
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I tell you the weight of my purposes
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

weight of my purposes
here is the site of the battle of maldon

Where I host my purposes
and it doesn’t take long

the impulse for my own purposes
I only think I don’t listen
