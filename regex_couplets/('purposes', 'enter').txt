('purposes', 'enter')

I tell you my purposes
The sun high enough to enter directly

Where I host my purposes
I have entered my purposes

the impulse for my own purposes
I have entered my purchases

entered into my purposes
I have entered my phone

elsewhere my purposes
I had entered my phone

for my own purposes
