('purposes', 'he')

I tell you my purposes
they can be waived

I tell you the weight of my purposes
They can be weighed

weight of my purposes
I tell you the weight of my purchases

Where I host my purposes
and elsewhere my memory

I have entered my purposes
and elsewhere my memory of you

the impulse for my own purposes
the impulse for my own purchases

entered into my purposes
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

elsewhere my purposes
washed my purchases

for my own purposes
I stay the right of my elections
