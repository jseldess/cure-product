('purposes', 'here')

I tell you my purposes
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I tell you the weight of my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity

weight of my purposes
here is the site of the battle of maldon

Where I host my purposes
and elsewhere my memory

I have entered my purposes
and elsewhere my memory of you

the impulse for my own purposes
where I stand aside

entered into my purposes
elsewhere my purposes

for my own purposes
I learned the point where I am
