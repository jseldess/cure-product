('purposes', 'so')

I tell you my purposes
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I tell you the weight of my purposes
so that nothing had gravity

Where I host my purposes
More reasons around my country 

I have entered my purposes
sound inundated for my own purchases

the impulse for my own purposes
and sound redundant

for my own purposes
buy in the sound privacy
