('purposes', 'tell')

I tell you my purposes
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I tell you the weight of my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity

weight of my purposes
So I constellate the time family country

Where I host my purposes
and that man comes on to tell me 

the impulse for my own purposes
