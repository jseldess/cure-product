('purposes', 'up?')

I tell you my purposes
And for an ungraspable time

I tell you the weight of my purposes
weight of my purposes

Where I host my purposes
The South Carolina primary 

I have entered my purposes
and elsewhere my memory of you

the impulse for my own purposes
the impulse for my own purchases

entered into my purposes
data collection on users

elsewhere my purposes
washed my purchases

for my own purposes
I return not sad exactly
