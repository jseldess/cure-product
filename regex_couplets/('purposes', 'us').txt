('purposes', 'us')

I tell you my purposes
I wear suspenders

I tell you the weight of my purposes
a futile joyous white sun

Where I host my purposes
was not just a defeat

I have entered my purposes
trackers collecting data on users

entered into my purposes
data collection on users

elsewhere my purposes
in the form filled offered in trust

the impulse for my own purposes
useless for not having paid

for my own purposes
I have them trust in me
