('purposes', 'you.')

I tell you my purposes
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I tell you the weight of my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity

weight of my purposes
a futile joyous white sun

Where I host my purposes
This is your voice 

I have entered my purposes
This is your chance

the impulse for my own purposes
the young ripples inaudibly
