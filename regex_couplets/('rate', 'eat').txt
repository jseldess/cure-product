('rate', 'eat')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
too sunny to eat ice cream

and my heart rate
Where I put it beating

Strategy comes before morning
of the habits I create

and strategies not tactics
of the habits they create

Aspirational strategy
of the habits they create.

I aspirate with little vision
That company creates a life
