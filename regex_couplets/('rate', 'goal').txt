('rate', 'goal')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Though there are quarters goals

and my heart rate
before morning goals

Strategy comes before morning
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

Its strategy comes before morning goals
Strategy comes before goals

and strategies not tactics
not goals

Aspirational strategy
Not goals or tactics

I aspirate with little vision
What would I feel without that goal
