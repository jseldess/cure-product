('rate', 'plan')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
and is relentlessly planned

and my heart rate
The planning process for visions

and strategies not tactics
I see the back of the planning process

Aspirational strategy
The planning process is for visionaries only

I aspirate with little vision
and for which the plan agreed
