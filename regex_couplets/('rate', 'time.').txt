('rate', 'time.')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
only fragments of time with my children

and my heart rate
I spend time online learning to code

Strategy comes before morning
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

and strategies not tactics
The long time I had a vision
