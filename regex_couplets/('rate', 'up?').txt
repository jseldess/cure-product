('rate', 'up?')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

and my heart rate
Then I cannot see face value

and my heartrate
of later results

Strategy comes before morning
Then the sun isn’t up

after having been contented Strategy comes before morning
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Its strategy comes before morning goals
but the sun isn’t up

Strategy comes before goals
barely outlines

and strategies not tactics
of my economic value

Aspirational strategy
I can see only the back of falling values

I aspirate with little vision
And as an extension of the values
