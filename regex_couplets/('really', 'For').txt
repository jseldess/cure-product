('really', 'For')

because it was really dark
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

When they really take hold of my finger
Forecasting the story before dawn

without really agreeing
For Mitt Romney

without really speaking
For my own purchases

without really breaking
Formerly a way like this one

also didn’t really move
For a while I think I don’t listen
