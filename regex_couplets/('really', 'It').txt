('really', 'It')

because it was really dark
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

it was really sunny
It keeps coming down thankfully

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
It has been since

When they really take hold of my finger
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

without really agreeing
It’s not marshal exactly

also didn’t really move
