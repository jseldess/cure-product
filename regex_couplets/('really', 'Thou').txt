('really', 'Thou')

because it was really dark
Though there are quarters goals

When they really take hold of my finger
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

without really agreeing
Though we are waiting for her

without really speaking
Though we are breaking 

without really breaking
Though we are waiting 

without really binding
Though we can’t help waiting

also didn’t really move
