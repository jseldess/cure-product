('really', 'To')

because it was really dark
To my children Walt Whitman

When they really take hold of my finger
To that impossible place

without really agreeing
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

without really speaking
To the ends of transactions

also didnâ€™t really move
To the right of determined elections
