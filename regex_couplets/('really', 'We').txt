('really', 'We')

because it was really dark
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

it was really sunny
We can wrestle them with their goals

When they really take hold of my finger
We had to say goodbye there

without really agreeing
We had inhabited actually

without really speaking
We ask say in that case
