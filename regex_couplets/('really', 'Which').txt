('really', 'Which')

because it was really dark
Which is a measure to never live out

When they really take hold of my finger
Which is a pleasure to never live out

without really agreeing
Which can be called confidence

without really speaking
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

also didnâ€™t really move
