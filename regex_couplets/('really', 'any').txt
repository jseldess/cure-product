('really', 'any')

because it was really dark
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

it was really sunny
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

When they really take hold of my finger
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

without really agreeing
if there is anything 

without really speaking
latency which doesn’t mean anything

without really branding 
if that has anything

without really needing
there wasn’t any television 

also didn’t really move
or imagined anyway
