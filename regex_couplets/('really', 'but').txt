('really', 'but')

because it was really dark
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

it was really sunny
but not impart cynicism

When they really take hold of my finger
but the sun isn’t up

without really agreeing
that decisions can be attributable

also didn’t really move
but for memory elsewhere
