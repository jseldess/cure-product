('really', 'call')

because it was really dark
not calling or echoing for once

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
though it was most emphatically that

When they really take hold of my finger
They are called aspirational

without really agreeing
Which can be called confidence

without really speaking
to take the call

without really branding 
The many transparent pixel calls

also didn’t really move
