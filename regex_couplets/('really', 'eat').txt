('really', 'eat')

because it was really dark
too sunny to eat ice cream

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
But I can’t let myself treat 

When they really take hold of my finger
executive breath

without really agreeing
was not just a defeat

without really speaking
for the creation of the universe

without really branding 
burrowed about from repeated travels

also didn’t really move
