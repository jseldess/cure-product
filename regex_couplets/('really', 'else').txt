('really', 'else')

because it was really dark
If you have confidence regardless all else

When they really take hold of my finger
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

without really agreeing
and elsewhere my memory

without really speaking
elsewhere by my memory

also didnâ€™t really move
By my memory elsewhere
