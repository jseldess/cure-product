('really', 'going')

because it was really dark
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

it was really sunny
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

without really agreeing
The way that she is going

without really speaking
The way that I am going

also didn’t really move
