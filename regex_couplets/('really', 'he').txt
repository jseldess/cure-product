('really', 'he')

because it was really dark
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

it was really sunny
Then fall then summer from my face

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
All of the time

When they really take hold of my finger
I search with my head

That’s when they really take
with my head

without really agreeing
if there is anything 

without really speaking
though we are breaking in the space that it had

without really breaking
they should rise up

without really branding 
the 

without really binding myself
uses for the attention of the brand

without really binding
when I move

without really needing
The floor slanted in places

also didn’t really move
By my memory elsewhere
