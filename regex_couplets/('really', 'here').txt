('really', 'here')

because it was really dark
Of course there is a direction

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
One day there is direction

When they really take hold of my finger
I’ll get there eventually

That’s when they really take
I’ll get there ruins

without really agreeing
if there is anything 

without really speaking
where I send and relive would be held

without really breaking
where I send and relive

without really branding 
Where in me did I host

without really binding
Elsewhere by my memory

without really needing
there wasn’t any television 

also didn’t really move
By my memory elsewhere
