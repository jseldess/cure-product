('really', 'keep')

because it was really dark
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

it was really sunny
It keeps coming down thankfully

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
I keep turning back again myself

When they really take hold of my finger
I keep turning back

That’s when they really take
