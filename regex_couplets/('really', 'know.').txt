('really', 'know.')

because it was really dark
who knows the way

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
how can I know without direction

When they really take hold of my finger
I even know what I would find

without really agreeing
knowing the constituents

without really branding 
who knows how to turn it off

also didn’t really move
that their knowing
