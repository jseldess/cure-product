('really', 'literal')

because it was really dark
and literally moved

without really agreeing
as it was designed literally

without really speaking
and literally unproved

without really breaking
literally unproved 

without really branding 
myself moved literally as it is

without really binding
I literally moved

without really needing
and literally moved about

also didnâ€™t really move
not literally moved about
