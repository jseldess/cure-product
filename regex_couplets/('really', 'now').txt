('really', 'now')

because it was really dark
on a snow day with my children

it was really sunny
who knows the way

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

When they really take hold of my finger
Right now I’m the cart

without really agreeing
knowing the constituents

without really branding 
who knows how to turn it off

also didn’t really move
that their knowing
