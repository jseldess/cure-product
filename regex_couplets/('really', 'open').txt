('really', 'open')

because it was really dark
Before we walk across the wide opening

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

When they really take hold of my finger
I wish my desires were open

That’s when they really take
The simple act opening surmounted

without really agreeing
