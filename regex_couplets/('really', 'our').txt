('really', 'our')

because it was really dark
conversations with our purchase

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Of course there is a direction

When they really take hold of my finger
or an available resource

without really agreeing
Or alter of course the time anyway

without really speaking
Who throws contours away

also didn’t really move
phrase them of our possessions
