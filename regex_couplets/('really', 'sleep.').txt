('really', 'sleep.')

because it was really dark
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

it was really sunny
where I sleep at times

When they really take hold of my finger
While I should be sleeping 

That’s when they really take
Looking back while I should be sleeping

without really agreeing
