('really', 'still')

because it was really dark
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

it was really sunny
That is itself not still

When they really take hold of my finger
I love my daughter still

without really agreeing
though we are still breaking in

without really speaking
still wash conserving

also didn’t really move
