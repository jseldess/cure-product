('really', 'than')

because it was really dark
It keeps coming down thankfully

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
than in the incoming stream

When they really take hold of my finger
than solid ground

without really agreeing
Having seen more than 

without really needing
Having seen more than I can remember
