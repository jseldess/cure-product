('really', 'time.')

because it was really dark
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

it was really sunny
only fragments of time with my children

When they really take hold of my finger
On the timeline I was on

without really agreeing
Or alter of course the time anyway

without really speaking
until a happier time found

without really branding 
formerly a long time they were on

without really needing
formerly along time they were on

also didn’t really move
in the long time they were on
