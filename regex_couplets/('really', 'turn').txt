('really', 'turn')

because it was really dark
In a sharp downard turn

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
in a sharp downward turn 

When they really take hold of my finger
I keep turning back

That’s when they really take
I keep turning back again myself

without really agreeing
who knows how to turn it off

also didn’t really move
I turn not sad exactly
