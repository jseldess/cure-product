('really', 'up?')

because it was really dark
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

it was really sunny
too sunny to eat ice cream

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

When they really take hold of my finger
While I should be sleeping 

That’s when they really take
Looking back while I should be sleeping

without really agreeing
We had inhabited actually

without really speaking
though we are breaking in the space that it had

without really breaking
for my own purchases

without really branding 
useless for not having paid

without really binding myself
uses for the attention of the brand

without really binding
it can be uncomfortable 

without really needing
and literally moved about

also didn’t really move
my daughter’s squirrel and chickadee joined me
