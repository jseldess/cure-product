('really', 'us')

because it was really dark
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

it was really sunny
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

When they really take hold of my finger
in a continuous vertiginous dream

That’s when they really take
In a continuous theme

without really agreeing
I want to cite a poem so usual

without really speaking
in the form filled offered in trust

without really breaking
useless for not having paid

without really binding myself
uses for the attention of the brand

without really binding
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

also didn’t really move
radiating from housing
