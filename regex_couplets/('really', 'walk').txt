('really', 'walk')

because it was really dark
Before we walk across the wide field

it was really sunny
Before we walk across the wide opening

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

When they really take hold of my finger
there was no walking along the pleasure

without really agreeing
