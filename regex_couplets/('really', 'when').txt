('really', 'When')

because it was really dark
When I woke up in the morning

it was really sunny
When I want something

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
When we had jobs that were to earn

When they really take hold of my finger
When closed to my knowing

without really agreeing
When I'm watching my tv 

also didn’t really move
