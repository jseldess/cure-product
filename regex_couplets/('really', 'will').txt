('really', 'will')

because it was really dark
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

When they really take hold of my finger
will not be the same

without really agreeing
would only willingly break

without really branding 
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

also didnâ€™t really move
my daughter will learn
