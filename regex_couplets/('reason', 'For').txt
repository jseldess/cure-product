('reason', 'For')

reasons resources
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

with reasons
Forecasting the story before dawn

with little reason to move
For an ungraspable time

More reasons around my country 
For my own purchases

and could be inflected with reasons
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
