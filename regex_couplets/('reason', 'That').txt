('reason', 'That')

reasons resources
That’s exaclty what I want for them

with reasons
That’s when they really take

with little reason to move
That company creates a life

with little reason to aspiration
That I captured an afterimage

More reasons around my country 
That are my right to say

and could be inflected with reasons
