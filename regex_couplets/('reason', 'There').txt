('reason', 'There')

reasons resources
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

with reasons
There was very little physical activity

with little reasons to aspiration
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Toward the start informally given my reasons
There are spots waiting

More reasons around my country 
There are constant ways

and could be inflected with reasons
