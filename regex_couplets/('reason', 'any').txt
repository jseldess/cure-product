('reason', 'any')

reasons resources
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

with reasons
Or the company

with little reason to move
The days aligned for company

with little reasons to aspiration
The days aligned long company

with little reason to aspiration
That company creates a life

embodied with little reason
there wasn’t any television 

Toward the start informally given my reasons
So I work and don’t look any

More reasons 
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

More reasons around my country 
They have very many choices

and could be inflected with reasons
