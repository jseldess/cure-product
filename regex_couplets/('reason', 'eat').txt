('reason', 'eat')

reasons resources
too sunny to eat ice cream

with reasons
was not just a defeat

with little reason to move
That company creates a life

with little reason to aspiration
it was not just a defeat

Toward the start informally given my reasons
And from that great distance

More reasons around my country 
for the creation of the universe

and could be inflected with reasons
