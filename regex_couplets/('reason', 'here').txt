('reason', 'here')

reasons resources
where I sleep at times

with reasons
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

with little reason to move
There was very little physical activity

with little reasons to aspiration
that potential is there for you

with little reason to aspiration
there was no promotion

Toward the start informally given my reasons
but where is it

More reasons around my country 
and elsewhere my memory of you

and could be inflected with reasons
The prospects there already
