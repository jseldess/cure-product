('reason', 'if')

reasons resources
drifting away

with reasons
if you have providence to excess

with little reason to move
That company creates a life

with little reason to aspiration
Life is with people

embodied with little reason
If I take a different measure

Toward the start informally given my reasons
If I take some different measure

More reasons around my country 
if you have providence

and could be inflected with reasons
if only on the way to the trash
