('reason', 'nor')

reasons resources
into the minority proportion of time

with reasons
nor work in this way daily

with little reason to move
the simple act of honoring an accountant

Toward the start informally given my reasons
nor envy honest work

More reasons around my country 
which had on honor to be told

and could be inflected with reasons
