('reason', 'potential')

reasons resources
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

with reasons
I am full of potential

with little reason to move
with full potential to movement

with little reasons to aspiration
full of potential

with little reason to aspiration
that potential is there for you

embodied with little reason
