('reason', 'ring')

reasons resources
interferring 

with reasons
hovering above standing water

with little reason to move
actually considering the end

Toward the start informally given my reasons
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

More reasons around my country 
firing and connecting somewhere

and could be inflected with reasons
The prospect for veering healthily
