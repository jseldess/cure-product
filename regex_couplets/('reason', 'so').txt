('reason', 'so')

reasons resources
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

with reasons
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

with little reason to move
my associations

with little reasons to aspiration
with little reasons to move

embodied with little reason
with little reason to aspiration

Toward the start informally given my reasons
More reasons 

More reasons around my country 
sound inundated for my own purchases

and could be inflected with reasons
buy in the sound privacy
