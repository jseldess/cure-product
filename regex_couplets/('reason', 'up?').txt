('reason', 'up?')

reasons resources
in a sharp downward turn 

with reasons
not one virtue to excess

with little reason to move
I argued that the days were longer

with little reasons to aspiration
And as an extension of the values

with little reasons to move
full of aspirations

with little reason to aspiration
full of potential

embodied with little reason
As an extension of the values

Toward the start informally given my reasons
around my country 

More reasons around my country 
I have entered my purposes

and could be inflected with reasons
decisions that can be attributable
