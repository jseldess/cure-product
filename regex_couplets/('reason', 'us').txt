('reason', 'us')

reasons resources
asynchronous 

with reasons
was not just a defeat

with little reason to move
So stay with us

with little reason to aspiration
but it continued rippling muscle

embodied with little reason
I reuse unassimilable visions

Toward the start informally given my reasons
I have them trust in me

More reasons around my country 
trackers collecting data on users

and could be inflected with reasons
