('reason', 'you.')

reasons resources
Though how can you know without direction

with reasons
if you have providence to excess

with little reason to move
since you can imagine movement

with little reasons to aspiration
where you can earn more 

Toward the start informally given my reasons
If you have confidence regardless all else

More reasons around my country 
This is your chance

and could be inflected with reasons
