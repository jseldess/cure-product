('reasons', 'Thou')

reasons resources
Though there are quarters goals

with reasons
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

Toward the start informally given my reasons
Though we are waiting for her

More reasons around my country 
Though we are breaking 

and could be inflected with reasons
