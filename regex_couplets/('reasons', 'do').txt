('reasons', 'do')

reasons resources
in a sharp downward turn 

with reasons
I brought my head down

with little reasons to aspiration
What I do in my liesure

Toward the start informally given my reasons
So I work and don’t look any

More reasons 
here is the site of the battle of maldon

More reasons around my country 
and it doesn’t take long

and could be inflected with reasons
I only think I don’t listen
