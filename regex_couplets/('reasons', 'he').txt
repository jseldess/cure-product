('reasons', 'he')

reasons resources
where I sleep at times

with reasons
When we had jobs that were to earn

with little reasons to aspiration
And as an extension of the values

with little reasons to move
The days were long aligned

Toward the start informally given my reasons
the opacity given to them

More reasons 
but where is it

More reasons around my country 
and elsewhere my memory of you

and could be inflected with reasons
stopping in the middle
