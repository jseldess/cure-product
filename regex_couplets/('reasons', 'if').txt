('reasons', 'if')

reasons resources
drifting away

with reasons
if you have providence to excess

with little reasons to aspiration
That company creates a life

Toward the start informally given my reasons
If I take a different measure

More reasons around my country 
if you have providence

and could be inflected with reasons
if only on the way to the trash
