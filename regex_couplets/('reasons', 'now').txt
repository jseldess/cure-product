('reasons', 'now')

reasons resources
On a snow day with my children

with reasons
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

with little reasons to aspiration
I take it out in the snow fall

Toward the start informally given my reasons
even when close to my knowing

More reasons around my country 
knowing the constituents

and could be inflected with reasons
