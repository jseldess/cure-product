('reasons', 'tell')

reasons resources
Then I constellate my time family country

with reasons
The CEO tells me to embody values

with little reasons to aspiration
I had to tell them the news

Toward the start informally given my reasons
I tell you my purposes

More reasons around my country 
and that man comes on to tell me 

and could be inflected with reasons
