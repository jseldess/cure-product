('reasons', 'very')

reasons resources
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

with little reasons to aspiration
There was very little physical activity

with little reasons to move
embodied everyday

Toward the start informally given my reasons
They have very many choices

and could be inflected with reasons
