('reflexing', 'up?')

reflexing indented in my phone
in traversing my circuit

sung reflexing
the right of surcharge

reflexing indented in my moan
I have them trust in me

state reflexing indented in my own
lung reflexing

my reflexing indented in my own tongue
tongue reflexing

reflexing indented in my own
the tongue and hands
