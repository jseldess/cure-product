('relive', 'form')

where I send and relive aside
A way formerly like this one

where I send and relive would be held
already formely a long time

where I stand and relive
in the form filled offered in trust

where I send and relive
dawn formerly

where I send and retrieve relive
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

and relive from burrowed travels
already formerly a long time

where I stand and retrieve relive
which I feel formerly about for
