('relive', 'he')

where I send and relive aside
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

where I stand and relive
the impulse for my own prospects

where I stand and retrieve relive
Where I host my purposes

where I send and relive would be held
All parties would be held for my own purchases

where I send and relive
But my not feeling the memory inside

where I send and retrieve relive
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

and relive from burrowed travels
from cables reheated travels

where I stand and retrieve and relive
where I am aside

where I end and relive
the duration of answers

where I blend and relive
The ends of my transactions
