('relive', 'here')

where I send and relive aside
where I stand and relive

where I stand and retrieve relive
Where I host my purposes

where I send and relive would be held
Where in me did I last

where I send and relive
where I end

where I send and retrieve relive
where I stand and retrieve and relive

where I end and relive
where I am aside

where I blend and relive
Where in me did I host

and relive from burrowed travels
firing and connecting somewhere
