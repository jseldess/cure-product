('remember', 'up?')

I can’t remember them
I have them trust in me

in that I cannot remember 
I assume the offers revisitable

Having seen more than I can remember 
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
I presume to others

terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
The sun high enough to strike directly
