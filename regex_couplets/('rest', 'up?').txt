('rest', 'up?')

wrestling to stay still
russling to stay still

We can wrestle them with their goals
there are quarters 

We can rest there in them with their goals
Though how can you know without direction

that agreed one of rest
own stays brought loyal

Aligned or not with my interests
which I feel formerly about for

 as points which are my interest 
iced coffee and sun position

My interesting politics
I return not sad exactly

home rest form to ourselves 
own best form to ourselves
