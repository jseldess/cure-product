('resume', 'Thou')

So I presume the offers already
Though there are quarters goals

and can’t presume to need
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I resume unassimilable visions
Though in not many acts

I resume attributable visions
Though we are waiting for her

I presume to others
Though we can’t help waiting

I presume the offers
