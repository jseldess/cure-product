('resume', 'Which')

So I presume the offers already
Which is a measure to never live out

and canâ€™t presume to need
Which can be pronounced to the world

I resume unassimilable visions
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I resume attributable visions
Which can be called confidence

I presume to others
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

I presume the offers
