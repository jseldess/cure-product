('resume', 'while')

So I presume the offers already
Looking back while I should be sleeping

I resume unassimilable visions
while wrapped in static

I resume attributable visions
while wrapped in explicit static

I continue to presume
while consuming damage

I presume to others
I answered while interfaced

I presume the offers
for a while to listen already

So I presume the offers at home already
for a while to listen 

I resume the offers at home
for a while not to listen

presume the offers at 
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
