('resume', 'come')

So I presume the offers already
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

and canâ€™t presume to need
Strategy comes before morning

I resume unassimilable visions
and that man comes on to tell me 

I presume to others
and come home to remind inflections

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
