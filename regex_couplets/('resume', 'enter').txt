('resume', 'enter')

So I presume the offers already
I have entered my phone

and canâ€™t presume to need
The sun high enough to enter directly 

I resume attributable visions
I enter the flattening mirror

I continue to presume
I have entered my purposes

I presume to others
I had entered my phone

I presume the offers
