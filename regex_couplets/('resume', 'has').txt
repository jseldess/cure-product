('resume', 'has')

So I presume the offers already
conversations with our purchase

and can’t presume to need
It has been since

Then I can’t presume to need others
in traversing my purchase

I resume unassimilable visions
purchased out

I presume to others
if that has anything

I presume the offers
converting sight into a purchase

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
