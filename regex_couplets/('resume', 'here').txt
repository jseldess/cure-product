('resume', 'here')

So I presume the offers already
The prospects there already

and can’t presume to need
where I sleep at times

drifting away needs others presume desires
I’ll get there eventually

Then I can’t presume to need others
That’s where I sleep at times

I resume unassimilable visions
Where I take my liesure

I resume indelible tracks
there was no television to hear

I resume attributable visions
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I continue to presume
I get through there

I presume to others
Where in me did I host

I presume the offers
The offers there already

So I resume the offers already
traffick is there nonetheless

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
