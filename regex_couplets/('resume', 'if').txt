('resume', 'if')

So I presume the offers already
drifting away

and can’t presume to need
drifting away needs others presume desires

Then I can’t presume to need others
at any time it can drift again

Then I can’t presume to feed others
drifting away from the task

I resume unassimilable visions
If I take a different measure

I resume indelible tracks
If I take some different measure

I resume attributable visions
if there is anything 

I presume to others
if that has anything

I presume the offers
if only on the way to the trash

So I resume the offers already
