('resume', 'know')

So I presume the offers already
who knows the way

and canâ€™t presume to need
I even know what I would find

I resume unassimilable visions
even when close to my knowing

I resume attributable visions
When closed to my knowing

I presume to others
who knows how to turn it off

I presume the offers
