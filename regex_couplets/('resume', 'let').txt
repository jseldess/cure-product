('resume', 'let')

So I presume the offers already
But I can’t let myself treat 

Then I can’t presume to need others
If I let myself see others desires

drifting away needs others presume desires
I let myself treat

Then I can’t presume to feed others
But I can’t let myself disregard

I resume unassimilable visions
I let it remind me again

I presume to others
