('resume', 'man')

So I presume the offers already
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

and can’t presume to need
To my children Walt Whitman

Then I can’t presume to need others
not many face up

I resume unassimilable visions
though not many facts up in the sky

I resume indelible tracks
in not many tracks up in the sky

I resume attributable visions
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

I presume to others
and that man comes on to tell me 

I presume the offers
