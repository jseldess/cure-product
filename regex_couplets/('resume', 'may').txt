('resume', 'may')

So I presume the offers already
may not be ingrained

I resume unassimilable visions
may not be engrained

I resume indelible tracks
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

I presume to others
and maybe regrettable 

I presume the offers
and maybe forgettable

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
