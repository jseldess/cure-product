('resume', 'nor')

So I presume the offers already
into the minority proportion of time

and canâ€™t presume to need

I resume unassimilable visions
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I resume attributable visions
nor work in this way daily

I presume to others
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

I presume the offers
