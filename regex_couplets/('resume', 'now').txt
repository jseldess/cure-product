('resume', 'now')

So I presume the offers already
On a snow day with my children

and can’t presume to need
Right now I’m the cart

Then I can’t presume to need others
out in the snow

I resume unassimilable visions
I take it out in the snow fall

I resume indelible tracks
even when close to my knowing

I resume attributable visions
When closed to my knowing

I presume to others
who knows the way

I presume the offers
