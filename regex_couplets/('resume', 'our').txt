('resume', 'our')

So I presume the offers already
reasons resources

and can’t presume to need
bring your child along

Then I can’t presume to need others
You can hear it also through your leisure

I resume unassimilable visions
or alter of course the time anyway

I presume to others
Who throws contours away

I presume the offers
