('resume', 'pleasure')

So I presume the offers already
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

and canâ€™t presume to need
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I resume unassimilable visions
up in the television pleasure

I resume indelible tracks
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I resume attributable visions
