('resume', 'so')

So I presume the offers already
I’ll pull myself another personality type

and can’t presume to need
reasons resources

Then I can’t presume to need others
You can hear it also through your leisure

I resume unassimilable visions
If I take some different measure

I resume indelible tracks
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I resume attributable visions
You can hear it also through static leisure

I continue to presume
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I presume to others
so still watch them

I presume the offers
and could be inflected with reasons

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
