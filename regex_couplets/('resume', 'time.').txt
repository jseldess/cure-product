('resume', 'time.')

So I presume the offers already
Then I constellate my time family country

and can’t presume to need
where I sleep at times

drifting away needs others presume desires
at any time it can drift again

Then I can’t presume to need others
That’s where I sleep at times

I resume unassimilable visions
The long time I had a vision

I resume indelible tracks
without the long time I was accounting

I resume attributable visions
So I constellate the time family country

I continue to presume
or alter of course the time anyway

I presume to others
formerly a long time they were on

I presume the offers
