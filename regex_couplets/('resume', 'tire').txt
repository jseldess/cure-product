('resume', 'tire')

So I presume the offers already
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I resume unassimilable visions
until I could not tire 

I resume indelible tracks
until I could not be tired

I resume attributable visions
for to tire as far back as my history

I continue to presume
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

I presume to others
