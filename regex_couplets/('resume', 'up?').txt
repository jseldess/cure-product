('resume', 'up?')

So I presume the offers already
at home brought into privacy

and can’t presume to need
But I can’t let myself treat 

Then I can’t presume to need others
as an impure product

drifting away needs others presume desires
Then I can’t presume to feed others

Then I can’t presume to treat others
as a pure product

I resume unassimilable visions
I reuse indelible tracks 

I resume indelible tracks
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I resume attributable visions
If I take a different measure

I continue to presume
attributable visions

I presume to others
own stays brought loyal

I presume the offers
revisions that can be attributable

So I resume the offers already
I offer to you

So I presume the offers
So I presume the offers at home already

I resume the offers at home already
brought into privacy

I resume the offers at home
I resume at home

presume the offers at 
but I own all that’s messageable

I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
I assume the offers reliable
