('resume', 'walk')

So I presume the offers already
Before we walk across the wide field

and can’t presume to need
there was no walking along the pleasure

I resume unassimilable visions
I walk up and don’t work anymore

I resume attributable visions
walking into percents blending themselves

I continue to presume
