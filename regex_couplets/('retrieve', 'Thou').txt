('retrieve', 'Thou')

I send and retrieve the impulse
Though we are waiting for her

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
Though we are breaking 

I stand and retrieve the impulse
Though we are waiting 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
