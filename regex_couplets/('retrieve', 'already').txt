('retrieve', 'already')

I send and retrieve the impulse
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
already formely a long time

I stand and retrieve the impulse
already formerly a long time

where I send and retrieve aside
with dawn already formerly nights 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
So I presume the offers already
