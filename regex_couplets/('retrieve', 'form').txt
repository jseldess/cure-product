('retrieve', 'form')

I send and retrieve the impulse
A way formerly like this one

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
already formely a long time

I stand and retrieve the impulse
in the form filled offered in trust

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
already formerly a long time

where I send and retrieve aside
dawn formerly

where I send and retrieve relive
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

retrieve 
with dawn already formerly nights 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
formerly a way

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
formerly a way like this one

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
formerly away

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
formerly my way 

where I stand and retrieve
which I feel formerly about for
