('retrieve', 'going')

I send and retrieve the impulse
The way that she is going

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
The way that I was going

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
way I was going 

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
