('retrieve', 'he')

I send and retrieve the impulse
But my not feeling the memory aside

I stand and retrieve the impulse
where I send and relive aside

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
where I stand and relive

where I send and retrieve aside
the impulse for my own purposes

where I stand and retrieve
aside the impulse to my purpose

where I stand aside and retrieve
where I stand and retrieve relive

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
I stand and retrieve the impuse

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
where I send and relive

where I send and retrieve relive
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

retrieve 
from cables reheated travels

where I stand and retrieve and relive
where I am aside

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
But my not feeling the memory inside

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
Selma helps too

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
the other end transactions
