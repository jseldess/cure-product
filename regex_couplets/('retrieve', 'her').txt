('retrieve', 'her')

I send and retrieve the impulse
where I send and relive aside

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
where I stand and relive

where I send and retrieve aside
where I stand aside

where I stand and retrieve
where I stand aside and retrieve

where I stand and retrieve relive
Where I host my purposes

I stand and retrieve the impulse
Where in me did I last

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
Elsewhere my memory

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
where I send and relive

where I send and retrieve relive
where I stand and retrieve and relive

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
Though we are waiting for her

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
with her way to the ends

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
the other end transactions

retrieve 
where I am aside
