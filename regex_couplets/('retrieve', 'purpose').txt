('retrieve', 'purpose')

I send and retrieve the impulse
the impulse for my own purposes

where I stand and retrieve
aside the impulse to my purpose

where I stand aside and retrieve
Where I host my purposes

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
the impulse to my purpose

where I stand and retrieve relive
to the other end of my purpose

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
for my own purposes
