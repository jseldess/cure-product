('retrieve', 'up?')

I send and retrieve the impulse
But my not feeling the memory aside

I stand and retrieve the impulse
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

where I send and retrieve aside
the impulse for my own purposes

where I stand and retrieve
aside the impulse to my purpose

where I stand aside and retrieve
Where I host my purposes

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
I stand and retrieve the impuse

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
for my own purchases

where I stand and retrieve relive
between the drug store and the 

where I send and retrieve relive
and relive from burrowed travels

where I stand and retrieve and relive
the duration of answers

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
But my not feeling the memory inside

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
I end up Bach

retrieve 
burrowed about from repeated travels
