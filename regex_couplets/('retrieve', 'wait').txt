('retrieve', 'wait')

I send and retrieve the impulse
Though we are waiting for her

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
not needing to wait

retrieve 
Though we are waiting 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
waiting out front or up above
