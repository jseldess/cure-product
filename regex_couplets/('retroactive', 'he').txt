('retroactive', 'he')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
who knows the way

In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light
Then fall then summer from my face

In the retroactive light
Face falling off the edge of the face

of retroactive observations
Then fall then summer

In the light of retroactive conversations
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

In the light of retroactive
Of course there is a direction

before we can have a retroactive
Before anyone buys up the opening
