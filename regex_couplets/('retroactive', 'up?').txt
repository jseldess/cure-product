('retroactive', 'up?')

variegated reflected retroactive reactive light
In a sharp downard turn

In the retroactive light
value falling off the edge of the face

of retroactive observations
such as I see

In the light of retroactive conversations
conversations with our purchase

In the light of retroactive
conversations with our reactions

before we can have a retroactive
conversation with our feelings
