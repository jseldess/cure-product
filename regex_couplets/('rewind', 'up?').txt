('rewind', 'up?')

I was advised to rewind
back up through results

rewind before the sun
Back up before the sun

So I was advised to rewind
back up the results

So I was enjoined to rewind
before the sunâ€™s deflections

and came home to rewind inflections
and could be inflected with reasons

and came home to rewind
decisions that can be attributable
