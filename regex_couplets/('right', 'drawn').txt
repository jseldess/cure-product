('right', 'drawn')

In the right sense
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
drawn formerly a long time

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
drawn formerly rights blended themselves

drawn formerly rights
drawn formerly rights ended themselves

where rights ended themselves
drawn formerly along 

That are my right to say
