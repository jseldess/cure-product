('right', 'he')

In the right sense
Without a head

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
But my not feeling the memory aside

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
where rights ended themselves

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

dawn formerly rights blended themselves
drawn formerly rights blended themselves

drawn formerly rights
ended themselves

drawn formerly rights ended themselves
where lights blended themselves

That are my right to say
the right of my elections

I stay the right of my elections
to the right of a surcharge

I stay the right of my possessions 
The right of incurred elections

The right of interned elections
To the right of determined elections

To the right of interned possessions
To the right of deterred elections

To the right of interned elections
to the right of possessions

the right of possessions
in the fill space 

to the right marking
in the space out front

the right of surcharge
at the site of a purchase

as the right of a surcharge
I have them lost

the right of a surcharge
I canâ€™t remember them
