('right', 'here')

In the right sense
where I sleep at times

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I send and retrieve relive

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
where rights ended themselves

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
where lights blended themselves

That are my right to say
my ethereal economic relations

I stay the right of my elections
I learned the point where I am

the right of a surcharge
where the tongue rippled
