('right', 'stay')

In the right sense
So stay with us

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
own stays brought loyal

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
own that stays brought loyal

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
I stay the right of my elections

to the right of a surcharge
I stay the right of my possessions 

The right of incurred elections
home stays brought loyal
