('right', 'turn')

In the right sense
in a sharp downward turn 

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
who knows how to turn it off

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
I turn not sad exactly

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
I return not sad exactly

I stay the right of my elections
I returned not sad exactly

The right of incurred elections
to return what I bought

the right of possessions
I returned to location

as the right of a surcharge
I returned

the right of a surcharge
