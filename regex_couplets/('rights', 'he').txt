('rights', 'he')

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
But my not feeling the memory aside

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
where rights ended themselves

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

dawn formerly rights blended themselves
drawn formerly rights blended themselves

drawn formerly rights
ended themselves

drawn formerly rights ended themselves
where lights blended themselves
