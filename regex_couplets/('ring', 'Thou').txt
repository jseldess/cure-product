('ring', 'Thou')

interferring 
Though there are quarters goals

bring your child along
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

actually considering the end
Though in not many acts

the simple act of honoring an accountant
Though we are waiting for her

firing and connecting somewhere
Though we are waiting 

The prospect for veering healthily
