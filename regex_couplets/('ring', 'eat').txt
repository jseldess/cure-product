('ring', 'eat')

interferring 
But I can’t let myself treat 

bring your child along
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

ring
Then I can’t presume to treat others

hovering above standing water
executive breath

actually considering the end
it was not just a defeat

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
And from that great distance

firing and connecting somewhere
for the creation of the universe

The prospect for veering healthily
