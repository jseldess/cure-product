('ring', 'man')

interferring 
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

bring your child along
Walt Whitman drifted

ring
not many face up

the simple act of honoring an accountant
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

firing and connecting somewhere
and that man comes on to tell me 

The prospect for veering healthily
