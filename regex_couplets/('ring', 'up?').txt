('ring', 'up?')

interferring 
interjecting into the stream of pictures

bring your child along
without imparting the cynicism

bearing children along
Puffs of air

ring
Then I can’t presume to need others

hovering above standing water
I’ll get there eventually

actually considering the end
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

the simple act of honoring an accountant
of honoring surmounted

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
I resume attributable visions

wearing trying talking into it
like un

storing in surfeit
Under the last principle of purchasing power

firing and connecting somewhere
for the duration of answers

The prospect for veering healthily
I presume the offers

Or can have seen offering possession
I presume to others

and can see offering
The sun high enough to strike directly

seen having or offering possession
You can have seen offering

in school and can see offering
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

can have seen offering possession
I assume possession to others
