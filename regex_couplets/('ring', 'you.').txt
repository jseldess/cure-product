('ring', 'you.')

interferring 
Though how can you know without direction

bring your child along
You can hear it also through your leisure

ring
if you have providence to excess

hovering above standing water
That you can see only the back of

actually considering the end
If you have confidence regardless all else

predated by the clouds bordering the horizon
a futile joyous white sun

storing in surfeit
I tell you my purposes

firing and connecting somewhere
the young ripples inaudibly

The prospect for veering healthily
