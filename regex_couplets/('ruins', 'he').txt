('ruins', 'he')

of later ruins
and my heart rate

Out of the remnant ruins
and my heartrate

Out of the back page ruins
low in the content architecture

Out of the remnant pages of later ruins
Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture

I’ll get there ruins
Then the sun isn’t up 

of later pages ruins results
Out of the remnants of later pages

out of the fifth page ruins
high up in the results

where I can lay claim to ruins
I’ll get there eventually

where I can claim to see the ruins
from where I can claim

to see the ruins
from where I can claim to see the mosquitos
