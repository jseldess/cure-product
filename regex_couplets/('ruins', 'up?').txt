('ruins', 'up?')

of later ruins
I brought my qualities down

Out of the remnant ruins
of later results

Out of the back page ruins
low in the content architecture

Out of the remnant pages of later ruins
Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture

I’ll get there ruins
Then the sun isn’t up 

of later pages ruins results
Eventually

out of the fifth page ruins
high up in the results

where I can lay claim to ruins
I’ll get there eventually

where I can claim to see the ruins
to see the ruins
