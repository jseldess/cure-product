('say', 'For')

we had to say goodbye
For an ungraspable time

We had to say goodbye there
For an ungraspable purchase

And we had to say goodbye to her there
For Mitt Romney

I ask say in that case
Formerly a way like this one

formerly along my say to the elections
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
