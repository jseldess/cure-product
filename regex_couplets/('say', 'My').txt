('say', 'My')

we had to say goodbye
My purpose up in the sky

We had to say goodbye there
My means without gravity

I ask say in that case
My daughter with her way

formerly along my say to the elections
My say to the elections

That are my right to say
My interesting politics

We ask say in that case
