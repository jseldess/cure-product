('say', 'though')

we had to say goodbye
I thought

I ask say in that case
after though thereâ€™s no memory

we ask say in that case
though we are waiting for her

formerly along my say to the elections
I answered what I thought

I ask say in that phase decisioned
I answered what I thought about

My say to the elections
