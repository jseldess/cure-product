('say', 'act')

we had to say goodbye
we had inhabited actually

I ask say in that case
to the ends of my transactions

we ask say in that case
to the ends of actions

formerly along my say to the elections
I turn not sad exactly

My say to the elections
I return not sad exactly

I ask say in that phase decisioned
before I act on them
