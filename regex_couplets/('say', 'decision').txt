we had to say goodbye
forgetting decisions 

I ask say in that case
decisioned to learn back

we ask say in that case
phase decisioned by the prospect

I ask say in that phase decisioned
phase decision for learning

formerly along my say to the elections
decisioned to learn 

My say to the elections
decisions that can be attributable
