('say', 'form')

we had to say goodbye
already formerly a long time

I ask say in that case
in the form filled offered in trust

we ask say in that case
A way formerly like this one

formerly along my say to the elections
formerly my way to the elections

I ask say in that phase decisioned
which I feel formerly about for

My say to the elections
own best form
