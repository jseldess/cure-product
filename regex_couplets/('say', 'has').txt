('say', 'has')

we had to say goodbye
Under the last principle of purchasing power

And we had to say goodbye to her there
for an ungraspable purchase

We had to say goodbye there
And need out in front purchase

I ask say in that case
if that has anything

we ask say in that case
phase decisioned by the prospect

I ask say in that phase decisioned
phase decision for learning

formerly along my say to the elections
phase decisioned

My say to the elections
at the site of a purchase
