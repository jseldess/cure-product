('say', 'he')

we had to say goodbye
Under the last principle of purchasing power

And we had to say goodbye to her there
she lay under the grass

We had to say goodbye there
under the grasp principle

I ask say in that case
speak them of my possessions

we ask say in that case
by in the sounded privacy

I ask say in that phase decisioned
for learning by the prospect

formerly along my say to the elections
formerly my way to the elections

My say to the elections
the right of my elections
