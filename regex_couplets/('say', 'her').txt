('say', 'her')

we had to say goodbye
And we had to say goodbye to her there

We had to say goodbye there
We had to buy there

I ask say in that case
Where in me did I host

we ask say in that case
with her waves

formerly along my say to the elections
where rights ended themselves

I ask say in that phase decisioned
By my memory elsewhere

My say to the elections
Cereal and othersâ€™ health
