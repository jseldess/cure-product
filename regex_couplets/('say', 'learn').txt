('say', 'learn')

we had to say goodbye
decisioned to learn 

I ask say in that case
decisioned to learn back

we ask say in that case
phase decision for learning

formerly along my say to the elections
for learning by the prospect

My say to the elections
I learned my location

I ask say in that phase decisioned
a precision for learning
