('say', 'need')

we had to say goodbye
And need out in front purchase

We had to say goodbye there
where I need gravity

I ask say in that case
without really needing

we ask say in that case
in need one in that best own

I ask say in that phase decisioned
not needing to wait

formerly along my say to the elections
need one in best own
