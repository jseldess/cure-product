('say', 'offer')

we had to say goodbye
in the form filled offered in trust

I ask say in that case
in the form filled offered trust

we ask say in that case
in track as offer asked 

formerly along my say to the elections
I assume the offers reliable

I ask say in that phase decisioned
I presume the offers
