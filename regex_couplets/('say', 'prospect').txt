('say', 'prospect')

we had to say goodbye
the impulse for my own prospects

I ask say in that case
stopping into the prospect

we ask say in that case
step in by the prospect

I ask say in that phase decisioned
for learning by the prospect

formerly along my say to the elections
speech that is of by prospects

My say to the elections
The prospects there already
