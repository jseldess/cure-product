('say', 'prospects')

we had to say goodbye
the impulse for my own prospects

I ask say in that case
speech that is of by prospects

we ask say in that case
the impulse my own prospects

formerly along my say to the elections
The prospects there already

I ask say in that phase decisioned
the prospects being seen by me
