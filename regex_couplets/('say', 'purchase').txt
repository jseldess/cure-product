('say', 'purchase')

we had to say goodbye
Having been purchased out of you

And we had to say goodbye to her there
for an ungraspable purchase

We had to say goodbye there
And need out in front purchase

I ask say in that case
converting sight into a purchase

formerly along my say to the elections
for my own purchases

My say to the elections
at the site of a purchase

We ask say in that case
