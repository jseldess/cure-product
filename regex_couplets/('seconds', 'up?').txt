('seconds', 'up?')

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

I end up Bach forty-one seconds in
But my not feeling the memory inside

Forty-one seconds in
to the other end of my purpose

44 seconds inside
and end up in Bach

44 seconds in 
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

I end up 44 seconds in
I stand and retrieve the impulse around
