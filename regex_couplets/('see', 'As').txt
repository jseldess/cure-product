('see', 'As')

Then I cannot see face value
As though stationary and a destination

If I let myself see others desires
Assimilable or

where I can claim to see the ruins
Aspirational strategy

I can see only the back of falling values
As an extension of the values

under the last seen principle
As a clone, illegally conceived

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
