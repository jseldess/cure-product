('see', 'but')

Then I cannot see face value
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

such as I see
but not impart cynicism

If I let myself see others desires
Attributable or

where I can claim to see the ruins
but the sun isn’t up

I see only the back of falling values
but it continued

under the last seen principle
I resume attributable visions

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
that decisions can be attributable

Having seen more than 
but for memory elsewhere

being seen by me
revisions that can be attributable

The prospect for seeing healthily
decisions that can be attributable

Having seen more than I can remember 
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
in that decisions can be attributable

Or can have seen offering possession
