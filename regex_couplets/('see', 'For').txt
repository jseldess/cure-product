('see', 'For')

Then I cannot see face value
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

If I let myself see others desires
Forecasting the story before dawn

I see only the back of falling values
For an ungraspable time

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
For Mitt Romney

Having seen more than 
Formerly a way like this one

being seen by me
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

The prospect for seeing healthily
