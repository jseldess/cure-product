('see', 'if')

Then I cannot see face value
drifting away

such as I see
if not directly on my skin

If I let myself see others desires
drifting away needs others presume desires

where I can claim to see the ruins
learned without too much difficulty to code

I see only the back of falling values
That company creates a life

under the last seen principle
If I take a different measure

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
if there is anything 

Having seen more than 
if that has anything

being seen by me
if only on the way to the trash

the prospects being seen by me
