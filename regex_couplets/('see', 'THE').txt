('see', 'THE')

Then I cannot see face value
THE SNOW

If I let myself see others desires
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

where I can claim to see the ruins
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

I see only the back of falling values
THE OFFERS

under the last seen principle
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
