('see', 'That')

Then I cannot see face value
That’s exaclty what I want for them

If I let myself see others desires
That’s where I sleep at times

where I can claim to see the ruins
That you can see only the back of

then I can see only the back values
That can’t be glimpsed

under the last seen principle
That I captured an afterimage

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
That are my right to say

being seen by me
