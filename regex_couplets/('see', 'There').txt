('see', 'There')

Then I cannot see face value
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

If I let myself see others desires
There are quarterly goals

where I can claim to see the ruins
There was very little physical activity

under the last seen principle
There are spots waiting

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Having seen more than 
There are constant ways

being seen by me
