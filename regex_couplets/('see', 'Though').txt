('see', 'though')

Then I cannot see face value
As though stationary and a destination

If I let myself see others desires
though it was most emphatically that

where I can claim to see the ruins
I had nightmares though

under the last seen principle
I thought

Having seen more than 
after though thereâ€™s no memory

being seen by me
