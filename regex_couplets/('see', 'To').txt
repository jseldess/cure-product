('see', 'To')

Then I cannot see face value
To my children Walt Whitman

If I let myself see others desires
To my chidren

where I can claim to see the ruins
Tomorrow

I see only the back of falling values
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

under the last seen principle
To neither study

Having seen more than 
To the ends of transactions

being seen by me
