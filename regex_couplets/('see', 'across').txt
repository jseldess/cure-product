('see', 'across')

Then I cannot see face value
Before we walk across the wide field

such as I see
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

as far as I can see
Before anyone walks across the opening

If I let myself see others desires
across the retinas

under the last seen principle
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

Having seen more than 
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

Or can have seen offering possession
