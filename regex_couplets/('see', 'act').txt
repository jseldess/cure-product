('see', 'act')

Then I cannot see face value
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

such as I see
In the light of retroactive conversations

as far as I can see
In the light of retroactive

in light of learning what we see
before we can have a retroactive

If I let myself see others desires
I was enjoined to act again myself

where I can claim to see the ruins
and strategies not tactics

I see only the back
Not goals or tactics

under the last seen principle
we had inhabited actually

Having seen more than 
to the ends of my transactions

being seen by me
before I act on them

Having seen more than I can remember
