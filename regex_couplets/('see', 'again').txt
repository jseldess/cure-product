('see', 'again')

Then I cannot see face value
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

such as I see
at any time it can drift again

If I let myself see others desires
I keep turning back again myself

where I can claim to see the ruins
I was enjoined to act again myself

I see only the back of falling values
blue and sun again a second, then night

I see only the back
I am bid to act again

under the last seen principle
I let it remind me again

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
