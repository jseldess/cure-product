('see', 'are')

Then I cannot see face value
Though there are quarters goals

If I let myself see others desires
who are so fresh and agile

where I can claim to see the ruins
barely outlines

I see only the back of falling values
They are called aspirational

under the last seen principle
There are spots waiting

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
Though we are waiting for her

Having seen more than 
still carefully

being seen by me
careening between the preambles

The prospect for seeing healthily
