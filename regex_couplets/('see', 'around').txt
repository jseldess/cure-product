('see', 'around')

Then I cannot see face value
Spinning around the heart

where I can claim to see the ruins
around my country 

under the last seen principle
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
More reasons around my country 

Having seen more than 
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

being seen by me
