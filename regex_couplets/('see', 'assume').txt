('see', 'assume')

Then I cannot see face value
I assumed it was visible

such as I see
I assumed 

Having seen more than 
I assumed what I draw

being seen by me
I assume the offers reliable

Having seen more than I can remember 
I assumed that they were divisible

Or can have seen offering possession
I assume possession to others

in school and can see offering
I assume the offers revisitable

seen having or offering possession
