('see', 'at')

Then I cannot see face value
variegated reflected light

such as I see
In the light of retroactive conversations

as far as I can see
What is an impure product

in light of learning what we see
conversation with our feelings

If I let myself see others desires
where I sleep at times

where I can claim to see the ruins
emerging this year from standing water

to see the ruins
emerging this year from too much standing water

to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water
to see the patterns on the birds

to see the sunrise
I am told ventillation

I see only the back of falling values
What the next step

I see only the back
of the habits I create

I see the back of the planning process
Whatâ€™s the next step

I see only the back of my habits
Aspirational strategy

I can see only the back of falling values
of the habits they create

I can see only the back of their economic value
That you can see only the back of

then I can see only the back values
they create

under the last seen principle
I resume attributable visions

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

Having seen more than 
that is by possessed

being seen by me
So I found myself at home

the prospects being seen by me
at home brought into private

The prospect of seeing healthily 
at home brought into privacy

The prospect for seeing healthily
that catch

Having seen more than I can remember 
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
that decisions can be attributable

Or can have seen offering possession
I assumed that they were divisible

seen having or offering possession
in that I cannot remember 

can have seen offering possession
