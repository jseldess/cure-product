('see', 'brought')

Then I cannot see face value
I brought my head down

where I can claim to see the ruins
own stays brought loyal

Having seen more than 
own that stays brought loyal

being seen by me
already brought into privacy

the prospects being seen by me
at home brought into private

The prospect of seeing healthily 
at home brought into privacy

The prospect for seeing healthily
