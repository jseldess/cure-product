('see', 'call')

Then I cannot see face value
not calling or echoing for once

such as I see
though it was most emphatically that

where I can claim to see the ruins
They are called aspirational

under the last seen principle
Which can be called confidence

Having seen more than 
The many transparent pixel calls

being seen by me
