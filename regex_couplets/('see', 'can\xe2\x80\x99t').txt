('see', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

Then I cannot see face value
I can’t fix them without direction

If I let myself see others desires
Then I can’t presume to need others

where I can claim to see the ruins
That can’t be glimpsed

under the last seen principle
Though we can’t help waiting

Having seen more than 
I can’t remember them

being seen by me
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

Or can have seen offering possession
