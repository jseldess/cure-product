('see', 'children')

Then I cannot see face value
On a snow day with my children

such as I see
only fragments of time with my children

If I let myself see others desires
To my children Walt Whitman

where I can claim to see the ruins
Even the children

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
my possession of my children

Having seen more than 
speech my possession of my children

being seen by me
