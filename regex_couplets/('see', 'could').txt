('see', 'could')

Then I cannot see face value
and could be mapped and weighed

where I can claim to see the ruins
until I could not tire 

under the last seen principle
I could consume the dream

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
and we could inhabit the room easy

Having seen more than 
and could be inflected with reasons

being seen by me
