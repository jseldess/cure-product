('see', 'data')

Then I cannot see face value
I’ll pull my data higher up

where I can claim to see the ruins
I’ll pull my data

I see only the back of falling values
The days of private data

under the last seen principle
trackers collecting data on users

Having seen more than 
my interfaced stand data

being seen by me
