('see', 'day')

Then I cannot see face value
On a snow day with my children

such as I see
One day there is direction

If I let myself see others desires
I argued the days felt longer

I see only the back
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

under the last seen principle
The day

Having seen more than 
at least most days

being seen by me
