('see', 'directly')

Then I cannot see face value
if not directly on my skin

If I let myself see others desires
But not to me directly

where I can claim to see the ruins
The sun high enough to enter directly 

under the last seen principle
The sun high enough to strike directly

Or can have seen offering possession
