('see', 'do')

Then I cannot see face value
in a sharp downward turn 

such as I see
It keeps coming down thankfully

as far as I can see
does not feel an exception

If I let myself see others desires
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

where I can claim to see the ruins
the dogs and lillies

I see only the back of falling values
What I do in my liesure

under the last seen principle
here is the site of the battle of maldon

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Having seen more than 
latency which doesn’t mean anything

being seen by me
I only think I don’t listen

The prospect for seeing healthily
