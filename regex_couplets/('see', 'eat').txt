('see', 'eat')

Then I cannot see face value
too sunny to eat ice cream

such as I see
I reach repeated expressions first

in light of learning what we see
I propogated repeated expressions first

If I let myself see others desires
Then I canâ€™t presume to treat others

where I can claim to see the ruins
executive breath

I see only the back of falling values
of the habits I create

I see the back of the planning process
of the habits they create

I can see only the back of their economic value
they create

under the last seen principle
And from that great distance

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
was not just a defeat

Having seen more than 
for the creation of the universe

being seen by me
