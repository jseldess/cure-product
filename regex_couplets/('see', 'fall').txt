('see', 'fall')

Then I cannot see face value
Then fall then summer from my face

such as I see
Then fall then summer

as far as I can see
and not falling at all

If I let myself see others desires
Face falling off the edge of the face

where I can claim to see the ruins
The value falling off the edge of th face

I see only the back of falling values
I see the back of falling values

I can see only values falling back
I can see only the back of falling values

then I can see only the back of values
out in the snow fall

I see only the back
out in the snow falling face value

I am not allowed to see their face
falling off the encoded end

under the last seen principle
