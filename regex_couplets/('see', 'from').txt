('see', 'from')

Then I cannot see face value
Then fall then summer from my face

such as I see
from the incoming stream

If I let myself see others desires
Falling from this distance

where I can claim to see the ruins
emerging this year from standing water

to see the ruins
from where I can claim to see the mosquitos

to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water
shielding from the bandwidth

I see only the back of falling values
aside from the retinas

under the last seen principle
get from here through there

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
And from a weak distance

Having seen more than 
from no one point

being seen by me
