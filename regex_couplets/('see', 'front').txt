('see', 'front')

Then I cannot see face value
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

If I let myself see others desires
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

where I can claim to see the ruins
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

I see only the back of falling values
in front of the set afternoon

I see only the back
in front of the set of regulations

under the last seen principle
And need out in front purchase

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
behind or out front or up above

being seen by me
