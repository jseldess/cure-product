('see', 'had')

Then I cannot see face value
If he had not carried one virtue

where I can claim to see the ruins
I had me a vision

I see only the back of falling values
Since I had to hold the entire company

under the last seen principle
we had to say goodbye

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
we had inhabited actually

Having seen more than 
in the space that it had

being seen by me
