('see', 'Having')

Then I cannot see face value
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I see only the back of falling values
Having been purchased out of you

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
Having seen more than 

being seen by me
Having seen more than I can remember 

I have seen more than I can remember
