('see', 'he')

Then I cannot see face value
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

such as I see
Then fall then summer

as far as I can see
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

in light of learning what we see
Before anyone buys up the opening

If I let myself see others desires
where I sleep at times

where I can claim to see the ruins
from where I can claim

to see the ruins
from where I can claim to see the mosquitos

to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water
to see the patterns on the birds

to see the sunrise
high up in the internet

I see only the back of falling values
blue and sun again a second, then night

I see only the back
upsent in the afternoon

I see the back of the planning process
I see the back of falling values

I can see only values falling back
out in the snow 

I see only the back of my habits
of the habits I create

I can see only the back of falling values
What the next step

then I can see only the back of values
out in the snow fall

I am not allowed to see their face
of the economic value

then I can see only the back values
of the habits they create

I can see only the back of their economic value
Their economic value

That you can see only the back of
The strength of the habits

under the last seen principle
in traversing get through there

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses

Having seen more than 
I speak them of my possessions

being seen by me
if only on the way to the trash

the prospects being seen by me
The offers there already

The prospect of seeing healthily 
between the preambles

The prospect for seeing healthily
between the preamble

Having seen more than I can remember 
I presume to others

Or can have seen offering possession
The sun high enough to strike directly

seen having or offering possession
I assume possession to others

in school and can see offering
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

can have seen offering possession
