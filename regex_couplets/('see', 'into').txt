('see', 'into')

Then I cannot see face value
into rotating directionless 

such as I see
into the stream of pictures

If I let myself see others desires
into a brigand and a murderer

where I can claim to see the ruins
into the well controlled climate

under the last seen principle
Then I saw into you

Having seen more than 
stopping into the prospect

being seen by me
already brought into privacy

the prospects being seen by me
at home brought into private

The prospect of seeing healthily 
at home brought into privacy

The prospect for seeing healthily
stepping off into the middle

Having seen more than I can remember 
converting sight into a purchase

Or can have seen offering possession
