('see', 'know')

Then I cannot see face value
who knows the way

such as I see
how can I know without direction

If I let myself see others desires
I even know what I would find

under the last seen principle
even when close to my knowing

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
knowing the constituents

Having seen more than 
who knows how to turn it off

being seen by me
