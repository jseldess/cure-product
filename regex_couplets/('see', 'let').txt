('see', 'let')

Then I cannot see face value
But I can’t let myself treat 

If I let myself see others desires
I let myself treat

where I can claim to see the ruins
It’s the third letter from the end

I see only the back of falling values
I let it remind me again

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
