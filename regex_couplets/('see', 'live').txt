('see', 'live')

Then I cannot see face value
Which is a measure to never live out

If I let myself see others desires
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

where I can claim to see the ruins
Which is a pleasure to never live out

under the last seen principle
where I send and relive aside

Having seen more than 
where I send and relive

being seen by me
