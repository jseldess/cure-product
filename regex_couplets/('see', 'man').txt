('see', 'man')

Then I cannot see face value
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

such as I see
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

If I let myself see others desires
To my children Walt Whitman

where I can claim to see the ruins
not many face up

under the last seen principle
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
They have very many choices

Having seen more than 
and that man comes on to tell me 

being seen by me
