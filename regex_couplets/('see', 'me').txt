('see', 'me')

Then I cannot see face value
Then I constellate my time family country

such as I see
Then fall then summer

as far as I can see
When I want something

in light of learning what we see
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

If I let myself see others desires
where I sleep at times

where I can claim to see the ruins
emerging this year from standing water

to see the ruins
emerging this year from too much standing water

to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water
I had me a vision

I see only the back of falling values
since I can imagine movement

under the last seen principle
I resume attributable visions

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
I came after my past

Having seen more than 
I presume to others

being seen by me
So I found myself at home

the prospects being seen by me
at home brought into private

The prospect of seeing healthily 
So I presume the offers already

The prospect for seeing healthily
I presume the offers

Having seen more than I can remember 
I have seen more than I can remember

Or can have seen offering possession
I assumed that they were divisible

seen having or offering possession
I assume possession to others

in school and can see offering
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

can have seen offering possession
