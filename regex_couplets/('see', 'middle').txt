('see', 'middle')

Then I cannot see face value
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

where I can claim to see the ruins
stopping in the middle

being seen by me
stepping in the middle

The prospect for seeing healthily
stepping off into the middle

Having seen more than I can remember 
stepping off in to the middle

Or can have seen offering possession
