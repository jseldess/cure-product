('see', 'no')

Then I cannot see face value
I’ll pull myself another personality type

such as I see
on a snow day with my children

as far as I can see
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

If I let myself see others desires
But not to impart cynicism

where I can claim to see the ruins
there was no promotion

I see only the back of falling values
upsent in the afternoon

I see only the back
of my economic value

I see the back of the planning process
an upsent afternoon

I see the back of falling values
out in the snow 

I see only the back of my habits
out in the snow fall

then I can see only the back of values
in front of the set afternoon

I can see only the back of falling values
out in the snow falling face value

I am not allowed to see their face
of the economic value

then I can see only the back values
I can see only the back of their economic value

That you can see only the back of
increasingly that their economic value

under the last seen principle
even when close to my knowing

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

Having seen more than 
and it’s not literal

being seen by me
for a while not to listen

The prospect for seeing healthily
in that I cannot remember 

Having seen more than I can remember 
The sun high enough to strike directly

Or can have seen offering possession
