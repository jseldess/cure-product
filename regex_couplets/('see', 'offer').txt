('see', 'offer')

Then I cannot see face value
in the form filled offered in trust

Having seen more than 
in the form filled offered trust

being seen by me
The offers there already

The prospects being seen by me
So I presume the offers already

The prospect for seeing healthily
I presume the offers

Having seen more than I can remember 
Or can have seen offering possession

and can see offering
seen having or offering possession

can have seen offering possession
You can have seen offering

in school and can see offering
I assume the offers reliable
