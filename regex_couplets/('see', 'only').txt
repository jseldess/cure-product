('see', 'only')

Then I cannot see face value
only fragments of time with my children

If I let myself see others desires
only in the case

where I can claim to see the ruins
So that I notice I am the only one

I see only the back of falling values
I see only the back

I see the back of the planning process
I can see only values falling back

I see the back of falling values
I see only the back of my habits

I can see only the back of falling values
then I can see only the back of values

I am not allowed to see their face
then I can see only the back values

I can see only the back of their economic value
That you can see only the back of

under the last seen principle
would only willingly break

Having seen more than 
if only on the way to the trash

being seen by me
I only think I donâ€™t listen

The prospect for seeing healthily
