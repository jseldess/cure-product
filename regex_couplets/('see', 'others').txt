('see', 'others')

Then I cannot see face value
others desires

If I let myself see others desires
drifting away needs others presume desires

where I can claim to see the ruins
I presume to others

Having seen more than 
Cereal and othersâ€™ health

being seen by me
I assume possession to others

in school and can see offering
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

Or can have seen offering possession
