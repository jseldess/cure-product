('see', 'over')

Then I cannot see face value
I step over the edge

If I let myself see others desires
over the long time up in the sky

where I can claim to see the ruins
over the time line I was on

I see only the back of falling values
oddly grown over with historic bark

under the last seen principle
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

Having seen more than 
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

Or can have seen offering possession
