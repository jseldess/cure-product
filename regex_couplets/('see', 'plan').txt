('see', 'plan')

Then I cannot see face value
and is relentlessly planned

If I let myself see others desires
The planning process for visions

I see only the back
I see the back of the planning process

I see the back of falling values
The planning process is for visionaries only

I see only the back of my habits
the planning process for decisions

I can see only the back of falling values
and for which the plan agreed

Having seen more than 
and to which the plan agreed

being seen by me
