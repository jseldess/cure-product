('see', 'possession')

Then I cannot see face value
I speak to them my possessions

Having seen more than 
my possession of my children

being seen by me
Or can have seen offering possession

and can see offering
seen having or offering possession

can have seen offering possession
I assume possession to others

in school and can see offering
