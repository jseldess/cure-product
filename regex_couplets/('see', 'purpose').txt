('see', 'purpose')

Then I cannot see face value
by no ventillation my purpose

where I can claim to see the ruins
until my purpose up in the sky

I see only the back of falling values
until I purpose the horizon

under the last seen principle
In conversing of my purpose

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
My purpose up in the sky

Having seen more than 
to the other end of my purpose

being seen by me
