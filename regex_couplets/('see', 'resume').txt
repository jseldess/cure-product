('see', 'resume')

Then I cannot see face value
and canâ€™t presume to need

If I let myself see others desires
drifting away needs others presume desires

where I can claim to see the ruins
I resume unassimilable visions

under the last seen principle
I resume attributable visions

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
I presume to others

Having seen more than 
So I presume the offers already

being seen by me
I presume the offers

The prospect for seeing healthily
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

Or can have seen offering possession
