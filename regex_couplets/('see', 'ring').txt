('see', 'ring')

Then I cannot see face value
interferring 

If I let myself see others desires
bring your child along

where I can claim to see the ruins
actually considering the end

under the last seen principle
storing in surfeit

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
firing and connecting somewhere

Having seen more than 
The prospect for veering healthily

Having seen more than I can remember 
Or can have seen offering possession

and can see offering
seen having or offering possession

can have seen offering possession
You can have seen offering

in school and can see offering
