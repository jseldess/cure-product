('see', 'seen')

Then I cannot see face value
under the last seen principle

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
Having seen more than 

being seen by me
the prospects being seen by me

The prospect of seeing healthily 
Having seen more than I can remember 

I have seen more than I can remember
Or can have seen offering possession

and can see offering
seen having or offering possession

can have seen offering possession
You can have seen offering

in school and can see offering
