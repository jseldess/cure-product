('see', 'step')

Then I cannot see face value
I step off the edge

such as I see
I step over the edge

If I let myself see others desires
What the next step

I see only the back
Whatâ€™s the next step

I see only the back of my habits
The next step 

under the last seen principle
step in by the prospect

Having seen more than 
phase decision step in

being seen by me
stepping in the middle

The prospect for seeing healthily
stepping off into the middle

Having seen more than I can remember 
stepping off in to the middle

Or can have seen offering possession
