('see', 'still')

Then I cannot see face value
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

such as I see
That is itself not still

If I let myself see others desires
I love my daughter still

under the last seen principle
though we are still breaking in

Having seen more than 
still wash conserving

being seen by me
