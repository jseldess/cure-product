('see', 'take')

Then I cannot see face value
I take hold of my finger

where I can claim to see the ruins
If I take a different measure

under the last seen principle
If I take some different measure

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
to take the call

Having seen more than 
and it doesnâ€™t take long

being seen by me
