('see', 'through')

Then I cannot see face value
You can hear it also through your leisure

If I let myself see others desires
Back up through the results

where I can claim to see the ruins
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

under the last seen principle
in traversing get through there

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
