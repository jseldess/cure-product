('see', 'up?')

Then I cannot see face value
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

such as I see
such as I can see

as far as I can see
What is an impure product

in light of learning what we see
conversation with our feelings

If I let myself see others desires
as an impure product

where I can claim to see the ruins
to see the ruins

from where I can claim to see the mosquitos
emerging this year from too much standing water

to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water
to see the sunrise

I see only the back of falling values
blue and sun again a second, then night

I see only the back
of my economic value

I see the back of the planning process
I see the back of falling values

I can see only values falling back
an upsent afternoon

I see only the back of my habits
upsent in the afternoon

I can see only the back of falling values
out in the snow fall

then I can see only the back of values
out in the snow

I am not allowed to see their face
of the economic value

then I can see only the back values
I can see only the back of their economic value

That you can see only the back of
increasingly that their economic value

under the last seen principle
I resume attributable visions

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
black spots on a white surface

Having seen more than 
I presume to others

being seen by me
So I found myself at home

the prospects being seen by me
at home brought into private

The prospect of seeing healthily 
So I presume the offers already

The prospect for seeing healthily
I presume the offers

Having seen more than I can remember 
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
that decisions can be attributable

Or can have seen offering possession
The sun high enough to strike directly

seen having or offering possession
You can have seen offering

in school and can see offering
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms

can have seen offering possession
I assume possession to others
