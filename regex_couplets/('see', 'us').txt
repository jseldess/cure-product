('see', 'us')

Then I cannot see face value
asynchronous 

such as I see
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

If I let myself see others desires
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

where I can claim to see the ruins
The ventillation rushes on

I see only the back of falling values
So stay with us

under the last seen principle
a futile joyous white sun

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
Articles all around us

Having seen more than 
in the form filled offered in trust

being seen by me
