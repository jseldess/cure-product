('see', 'vision')

Then I cannot see face value
I had me a vision

I see only the back of falling values
The planning process for visions

I see only the back
The planning process is for visionaries only

I see only the back of my habits
aspirating visions

under the last seen principle
I resume attributable visions

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
there wasnâ€™t any television 

Having seen more than 
joined in my television

being seen by me
revisions that can be attributable

The prospect for seeing healthily
