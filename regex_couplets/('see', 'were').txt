('see', 'were')

Then I cannot see face value
When we had jobs that were to earn

where I can claim to see the ruins
I argued the days were longer

under the last seen principle
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
formerly a long time they were on

Having seen more than 
answered about 

being seen by me
that they were divisible

Having seen more than I can remember 
I assumed that they were divisible

Or can have seen offering possession
