('see', 'you.')

Then I cannot see face value
Though how can you know without direction

If I let myself see others desires
bring your child along

where I can claim to see the ruins
That you can see only the back of

then I can see only the back values
your bid to the next highest ranked network

under the last seen principle
a futile joyous white sun

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
I tell you my purposes

Having seen more than 
the young ripples inaudibly

being seen by me
