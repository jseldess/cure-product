('seen', 'he')

under the last seen principle
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

Having seen more than 
I speak them of my possessions

being seen by me
if only on the way to the trash

the prospects being seen by me
The offers there already

Having seen more than I can remember 
I presume to others

Or can have seen offering possession
The sun high enough to strike directly

seen having or offering possession
I assume possession to others

can have seen offering possession
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
