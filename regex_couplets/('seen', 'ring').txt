('seen', 'ring')

under the last seen principle
storing in surfeit

Having seen more than 
firing and connecting somewhere

being seen by me
The prospect for veering healthily

Having seen more than I can remember 
Or can have seen offering possession

seen having or offering possession
can have seen offering possession

You can have seen offering
in school and can see offering
