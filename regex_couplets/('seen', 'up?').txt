('seen', 'up?')

under the last seen principle
I resume attributable visions

Having seen more than 
I presume to others

being seen by me
So I found myself at home

the prospects being seen by me
at home brought into private

Having seen more than I can remember 
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
that decisions can be attributable

Or can have seen offering possession
The sun high enough to strike directly

seen having or offering possession
You can have seen offering

can have seen offering possession
I assume possession to others
