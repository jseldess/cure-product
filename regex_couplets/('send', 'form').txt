('send', 'form')

I send and retrieve the impulse
A way formerly like this one

where I send and relive would be held
already formely a long time

where I send and relive aside
in the form filled offered in trust

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
already formerly a long time

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
dawn formerly

where I send and retrieve relive
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

where I send and relive
with dawn already formerly nights 

where I send and retrieve aside
which I feel formerly about for
