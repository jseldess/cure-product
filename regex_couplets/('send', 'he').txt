('send', 'he')

I send and retrieve the impulse
But my not feeling the memory aside

where I send and relive aside
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

where I send and retrieve aside
the impulse for my own purposes

where I send and relive would be held
where I stand and relive

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
I stand and retrieve the impuse

where I send and relive
But my not feeling the memory inside

where I send and retrieve relive
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

where I send and receive
where I am aside
