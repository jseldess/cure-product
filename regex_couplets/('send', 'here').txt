('send', 'here')

I send and retrieve the impulse
where I send and relive aside

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
where I stand and relive

where I send and retrieve aside
where I stand aside

where I send and relive would be held
Where in me did I last

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
Elsewhere my memory

where I send and relive
where I end

where I send and retrieve relive
where I stand and retrieve and relive

where I send and receive
where I am aside
