('set', 'he')

upset by Gingrich
If he had not carried one virtue

in front of the set afternoon
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

in front of the set of regulations
I tried to feel the key values extending 

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Um, upset by Gingrich
To substitute neither study

presets
phrase them

preset
I canâ€™t remember them

reset
I assume the offers reliable
