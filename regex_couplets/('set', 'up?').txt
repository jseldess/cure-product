('set', 'up?')

upset by Gingrich
If he had not carried one virtue

in front of the set afternoon
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

in front of the set of regulations
with internally regulated climate

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Um, upset by Gingrich
This is your choice 

presets
decisions that can be attributable

preset
between bills and stuffed animals
