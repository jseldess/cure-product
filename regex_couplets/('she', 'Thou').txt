('she', 'Thou')

I told her a story, she drew waves.
Though there are quarters goals

A turtle fished out of the lake
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

she lay under the grass
Though we are waiting for her

washed by my memory
Though we are breaking 

washed my memory
Though we are waiting 

washed
Though we can’t help waiting
