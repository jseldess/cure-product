('she', 'else')

I told her a story, she drew waves.
If you have confidence regardless all else

A turtle fished out of the lake
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

washed by my memory
and elsewhere my memory

washed my memory
elsewhere my purposes

washed my purchases
elsewhere by my memory

washed
By my memory elsewhere

washed I answered about
in memory elsewhere
