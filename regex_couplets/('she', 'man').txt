('she', 'man')

I told her a story, she drew waves.
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

A turtle fished out of the lake
not many face up

she lay under the grass
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

washed by my memory
They have very many choices

washed my purchases
and that man comes on to tell me 

washed
The many transparent pixel calls
