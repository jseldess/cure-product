('she', 'ring')

I told her a story, she drew waves.
interferring 

A turtle fished out of the lake
hovering above standing water

The ventillation rushes on
actually considering the end

she lay under the grass
storing in surfeit

washed by my memory
firing and connecting somewhere

washed my memory
The prospect for veering healthily
