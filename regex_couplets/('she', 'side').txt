('she', 'side')

I told her a story, she drew waves.
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

A turtle fished out of the lake
aside from the retinas

she lay under the grass
But my not feeling the memory aside

washed my memory
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

washed by my memory
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

washed
But my not feeling the memory inside

The way that she is going
By my feeling the memory inside
