('she', 'time.')

I told her a story, she drew waves.
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

A turtle fished out of the lake
I spend time online learning to code

The ventillation rushes on
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

she lay under the grass
or alter of course the time anyway

washed by my memory
formerly a long time they were on

washed my memory
until a happier time found

washed
formerly along time they were on

The way that she is going
time they were on
