('should', 'eat')

You should ask who I am
too sunny to eat ice cream

While I should be sleeping
Where I put it beating

Looking back while I should be sleeping
executive breath

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
was not just a defeat

they should rise up
for the creation of the universe
