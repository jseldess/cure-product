('should', 'open')

You should ask who I am
Before we walk across the wide opening

While I should be sleeping
my desires were open

Looking back while I should be sleeping
I wish my desires were open

While I should sleep not back in the results
The simple act opening surmounted

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
