('should', 'you.')

You should ask who I am
Though how can you know without direction

While I should be sleeping
That you can see only the back of

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I tell you my purposes

One was up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes

they should rise up
the young ripples inaudibly
