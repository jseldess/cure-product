('side', 'eat')

But that is beside the point
too sunny to eat ice cream

I’m simply inside
But I can’t let myself treat 

aside from the retinas
That company creates a life

actually considering the end
it was not just a defeat

But my not feeling the memory aside
for the creation of the universe

where I am aside
burrowed about from repeated travels

But my feeling the memory aside
