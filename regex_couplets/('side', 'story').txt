('side', 'story')

But that is beside the point
I told her a story, she drew waves.

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Forecasting the story before dawn

aside from the retinas
as far back as my history heard

actually considering the end
You need history

But my not feeling the memory aside
