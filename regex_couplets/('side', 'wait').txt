('side', 'wait')

But that is beside the point
There are spots waiting

But my not feeling the memory aside
Though we are waiting for her

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
not needing to wait

where I am aside
Though we are waiting 

by the side of the hosting service
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

But my not feeling the memory inside
waiting out front or up above
