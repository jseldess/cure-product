('sight', 'he')

In my sight 
I had to tell them the news

in pursuit of the sight
I get through there

converting sight
speak them of my possessions

my sight hosting
Where in me did I lose

about the sight hosting trusting
by the sight of the hosting answered about

converting sight into a purchase
the way was water
