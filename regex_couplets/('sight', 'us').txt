('sight', 'us')

In my sight 
but it continued rippling muscle

in pursuit of the sight
a futile joyous white sun

converting sight
in the form filled offered in trust

my sight hosting
about the sight hosting trusting

by the sight of the hosting answered about
in the form filled offered trust

converting sight into a purchase
radiating from housing
