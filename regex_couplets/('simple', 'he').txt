('simple', 'he')

simple black spots
Though in not many acts up in the sky

Though it is not many simple acts
not the simple act

Though it is not a simple act
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

in the simple act of reading
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

The simple act opening surmounted
The simple act of opening surmounted

the simple act of honoring an accountant
in the simple act of opening a book

in the simple act of opening an accountant
You can hear it also through static leisure
