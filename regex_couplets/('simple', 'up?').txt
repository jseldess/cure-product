('simple', 'up?')

simple black spots
Though in not many acts up in the sky

Though it is not many simple acts
While weâ€™re up in the sky

Though it is not a simple act
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

in the simple act of reading
between bills and stuffed animals

The simple act opening surmounted
You can clear it also through static seizure

The simple act of opening surmounted
the simple act of honoring an accountant

in the simple act of opening a book
in the simple act of opening an accountant
