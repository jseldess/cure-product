('sky', 'A')

over the long time up in the sky
And as an extension of the values

over the long line up in the sky
After having been contented

Blue sky or
Attributable or

until my purpose up in the sky
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

though not many facts up in the sky
A defeated

Up in the sky
Articles all around stores in surfeit

My purpose up in the sky
And we had to say goodbye to her there

While they’re up in the sky
And reached up the screen

until I purchase up the sky
And from that great distance

While we’re up in the sky
And from a great distance
