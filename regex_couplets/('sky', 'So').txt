('sky', 'so')

over the long time up in the sky
reasons resources

over the long line up in the sky
You can hear it also through your leisure

Blue sky or
A person from a distance

until my purpose up in the sky
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

though not many facts up in the sky
If I take some different measure

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

in not many tracks up in the sky
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Up in the sky
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

While weâ€™re up in the sky 
so that nothing had gravity
