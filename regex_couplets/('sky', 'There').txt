('sky', 'There')

over the long time up in the sky
There are quarterly goals

over the long line up in the sky
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Blue sky or
There was very little physical activity

though not many facts up in the sky
There are spots waiting

until I purchase up in the sky
There are constant ways
