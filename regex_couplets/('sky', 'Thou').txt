('sky', 'Thou')

over the long time up in the sky
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

though not many facts up in the sky
Though in not many acts

Though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

While we’re up in the sky
Though it is not a simple act

Up in the sky
Though we are waiting for her
