('sky', 'act')

over the long time up in the sky
I was enjoined to act again myself

over the long line up in the sky
I was enjoined to act again

until my purpose up in the sky
and strategies not tactics

though not many facts up in the sky
Though in not many acts

Though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

While weâ€™re up in the sky
Though it is not a simple act

Up in the sky
we had inhabited actually
