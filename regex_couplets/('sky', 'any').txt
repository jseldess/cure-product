('sky', 'any')

over the long time up in the sky
at any time it can drift again

over the long line up in the sky
Or the company

until my purpose up in the sky
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

though not many facts up in the sky
in not many tracks up in the sky

and stuff up in the sky
Though in not many acts

Though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

While we’re up in the sky
I walk up and don’t work anymore

Up in the sky
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

While they’re up in the sky
there wasn’t any television 

until I purchase up the sky
without any further damage
