('sky', 'been')

over the long time up in the sky
It has been since

over the long line up in the sky
After having been contented

Blue sky or
that having been after content

though not many facts up in the sky
having been graspable

Up in the sky
Having been purchased out of you

While theyâ€™re up in the sky
