('sky', 'could')

over the long time up in the sky
and could be mapped and weighed

over the long line up in the sky
until I could not tire 

though not many facts up in the sky
until I could not be tired

Up in the sky
I could consume the dream

until I purchase up the sky
I could in effect credit
