('sky', 'count')

over the long time up in the sky
Then I constellate my time family country

over the long line up in the sky
So I constellate the time family country

Blue sky or
I brought my count down

until my purpose up in the sky
without the long time I was accounting

though not many facts up in the sky
the simple act of honoring an accountant

Up in the sky
More reasons around my country
