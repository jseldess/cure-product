('sky', 'distance')

over the long time up in the sky
Falling from this distance

over the long line up in the sky
A person from a distance

until my purpose up in the sky
And from a weak distance

While they’re up in the sky
And from that great distance

until I purchase up the sky
And from a great distance

While we’re up in the sky
