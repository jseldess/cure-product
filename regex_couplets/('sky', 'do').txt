('sky', 'do')

over the long time up in the sky
in a sharp downward turn 

over the long line up in the sky
The dogs and lillies

Blue sky or
I brought my head down

until my purpose up in the sky
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

though not many facts up in the sky
What I do in my liesure

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
I walk up and don’t work anymore

Up in the sky
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

While they’re up in the sky
around the dogs and lillies

until I purchase up the sky
I click my zipcode up where it should be down
