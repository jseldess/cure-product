('sky', 'eat')

over the long time up in the sky
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

over the long line up in the sky
was not just a defeat

Blue sky or
Where I put it beating

until my purpose up in the sky
of the habits I create

though not many facts up in the sky
it was not just a defeat

Up in the sky
And from that great distance

until I purchase up the sky
And from a great distance

While weâ€™re up in the sky
for the creation of the universe
