('sky', 'he')

over the long time up in the sky
I’ll get there eventually

over the long line up in the sky
over the long line I would honor

until my purpose up in the sky
Then I cannot see face value

Blue sky or
 and time in the train

though not many facts up in the sky
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
I can hear them between bills and stuff

in not many tracks up in the sky
there was no television to hear

and stuff up in the sky
Though in not many acts up in the sky

While we’re up in the sky
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

Up in the sky
My purpose up in the sky

While they’re up in the sky
I tell you the weight of my purchases

until I purpose up in the sky
my purchase up in the sky

until I purchase up in the sky
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

until I purchase up the sky
around the dogs and lillies

until I purchase the sky
all the spots

until my purchase up in the sky
my purchse up in the sky
