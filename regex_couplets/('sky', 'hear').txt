('sky', 'hear')

over the long time up in the sky
You can hear it also through your leisure

over the long line up in the sky
and my heart rate

until my purpose up in the sky
I hear it between bills and stuff

though not many facts up in the sky
as far back as my history heard

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
I can hear them between bills and stuff

in not many tracks up in the sky
there was no television to hear

and stuff up in the sky
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

though in not many acts up in the sky
You can hear it also through static leisure

Up in the sky
In my heart did I lose trust
