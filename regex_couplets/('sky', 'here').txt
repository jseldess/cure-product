('sky', 'here')

over the long time up in the sky
I’ll get there eventually

over the long line up in the sky
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Blue sky or
Where official policy is to catch and release

until my purpose up in the sky
there was no promotion

though not many facts up in the sky
there was no television to hear

and stuff up in the sky
but where is it

Up in the sky
We had to say goodbye there

My purpose up in the sky
 of those gathered

While they’re up in the sky
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

While we’re up in the sky 
there wasn’t any television 

until I purchase up the sky
where I need gravity

until I purchase the sky
There are spots waiting

until I purchase up in the sky
I click my zipcode up where it should be down
