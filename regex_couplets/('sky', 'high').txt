('sky', 'high')

over the long time up in the sky
way high up in the inter

over the long line up in the sky
higher up in the results

until my purpose up in the sky
your bid to the next highest ranked network

though not many facts up in the sky
The sun high enough to enter directly 

Up in the sky
The sun high enough to strike directly
