('sky', 'hold')

over the long time up in the sky
I take hold of my finger

Blue sky or
When they really take hold of my finger

over the long line up in the sky
Since I had to hold the entire company

though not many facts up in the sky
and hold and wish to hold

Up in the sky
designed to hold up my underwear

until I purchase up the sky
