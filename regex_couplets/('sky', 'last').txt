('sky', 'last')

over the long time up in the sky
What was the last time

though not many facts up in the sky
under the last seen principle

Up in the sky
Under the last principle

My purpose up in the sky
Under the last principle of purchasing power

While theyâ€™re up in the sky
Where in me did I last
