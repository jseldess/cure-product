('sky', 'many')

over the long time up in the sky
not many face up

though not many facts up in the sky
in not many tracks up in the sky

and stuff up in the sky
Though in not many acts

Though in not many acts up in the sky
Though in not many facts

While weâ€™re up in the sky
They have very many choices
