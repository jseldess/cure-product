('sky', 'no')

over the long time up in the sky
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

over the long line up in the sky
over the long line I would honor

until my purpose up in the sky
Then I cannot see face value

Blue sky or
In a vertiginous dream

though not many facts up in the sky
until I could not tire 

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

in not many tracks up in the sky
there was no television to hear

and stuff up in the sky
Though in not many acts

Though in not many acts up in the sky
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

While weâ€™re up in the sky
Though it is not a simple act

Up in the sky
I used my technology

until I purchase up the sky
that nothing had gravity
