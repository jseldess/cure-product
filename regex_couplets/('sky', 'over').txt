('sky', 'over')

over the long time up in the sky
over the time line I was on

over the long line up in the sky
over the long line I would honor

until my purpose up in the sky
hovering above standing water

though not many facts up in the sky
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

Up in the sky
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
