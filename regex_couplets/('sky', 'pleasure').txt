('sky', 'pleasure')

over the long time up in the sky
Which is a pleasure to never live out

Blue sky or
there was no walking along the pleasure

though not many facts up in the sky
up in the television pleasure

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

in not many tracks up in the sky
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Up in the sky
