('sky', 'purpose')

over the long time up in the sky
by no ventillation my purpose

over the long line up in the sky
until my purpose up in the sky

Blue sky or
until I purpose the horizon

Up in the sky
My purpose up in the sky

While they’re up in the sky
until I purpose up in the sky

While we’re up in the sky
I tell you my purposes

until I purchase up the sky
I tell you the weight of my purposes
