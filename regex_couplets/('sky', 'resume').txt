('sky', 'resume')

over the long time up in the sky
Then I canâ€™t presume to need others

over the long line up in the sky
I resume unassimilable visions

though not many facts up in the sky
I resume indelible tracks

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
I resume attributable visions

Up in the sky
I presume to others
