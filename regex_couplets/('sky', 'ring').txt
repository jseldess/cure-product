('sky', 'ring')

over the long time up in the sky
ring

over the long line up in the sky
hovering above standing water

until my purpose up in the sky
actually considering the end

though not many facts up in the sky
the simple act of honoring an accountant

Up in the sky
storing in surfeit

My purpose up in the sky
firing and connecting somewhere
