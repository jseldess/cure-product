('sky', 'tell')

over the long time up in the sky
Then I constellate my time family country

over the long line up in the sky
So I constellate the time family country

Blue sky or
The CEO tells me to embody values

until my purpose up in the sky
I had to tell them the news

though not many facts up in the sky
I tell you my purposes

While theyâ€™re up in the sky
I tell you the weight of my purchases

until I purpose up in the sky
I tell you the weight of my purposes
