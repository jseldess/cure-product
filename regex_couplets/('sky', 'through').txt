('sky', 'through')

over the long time up in the sky
You can hear it also through your leisure

over the long line up in the sky
Back up through the results

until my purpose up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

though not many facts up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through investiture

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

in not many tracks up in the sky
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Up in the sky
