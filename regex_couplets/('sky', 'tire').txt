('sky', 'tire')

over the long time up in the sky
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

though not many facts up in the sky
until I could not tire 

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
until I could not be tired

Up in the sky
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
