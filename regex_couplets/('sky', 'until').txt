('sky', 'until')

over the long time up in the sky
until my purpose up in the sky

over the long line up in the sky
until I could not tire 

though not many facts up in the sky
until I could not be tired

Up in the sky
until I purpose up in the sky

While weâ€™re up in the sky
until I purchase up in the sky

My purpose up in the sky
until I purchase up the sky

until I purchase the sky
until my purchase up in the sky

my purchse up in the sky
until the bill came
