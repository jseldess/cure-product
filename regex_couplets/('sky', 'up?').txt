('sky', 'up?')

over the long time up in the sky
I’ll get there eventually

over the long line up in the sky
over the long line I would honor

until my purpose up in the sky
Then I cannot see face value

Blue sky or
Two hours and

though not many facts up in the sky
I resume unassimilable visions

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
I can hear them between bills and stuff

in not many tracks up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

and stuff up in the sky
Though in not many acts

Though in not many acts up in the sky
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

While we’re up in the sky
Though it is not a simple act

Up in the sky
for an ungraspable purchase

My purpose up in the sky
Sweets and coffee and juice

While they’re up in the sky
I tell you the weight of my purchases

until I purpose up in the sky
my purchase up in the sky

until I purchase up in the sky
And reached up the screen

until I purchase up the sky
around the dogs and lillies

until I purchase the sky
I spin around 

until my purchase up in the sky
my purchse up in the sky
