('sky', 'us')

over the long time up in the sky
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

over the long line up in the sky
I want to cite a poem so usual

Blue sky or
In a vertiginous dream

until my purpose up in the sky
The ventillation rushes on

though not many facts up in the sky
it was not just a defeat

Up in the sky
articles all around us

My purpose up in the sky
I wear suspenders

until I purchase up the sky
suspenders

While weâ€™re up in the sky
a futile joyous white sun
