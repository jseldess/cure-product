('sky', 'vision')

over the long time up in the sky
I had me a vision

over the long line up in the sky
The planning process for visions

though not many facts up in the sky
I resume unassimilable visions

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
up in the television

in not many tracks up in the sky
there was no television to hear

and stuff up in the sky
I resume attributable visions

Up in the sky
there wasnâ€™t any television 

until I purchase up the sky
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
