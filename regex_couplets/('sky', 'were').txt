('sky', 'were')

over the long time up in the sky
When we had jobs that were to earn

Blue sky or
my desires were open

over the long line up in the sky
I argued the days were longer

though not many facts up in the sky
they were on

Up in the sky
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
