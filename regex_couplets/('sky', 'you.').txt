('sky', 'you.')

over the long time up in the sky
You can hear it also through your leisure

over the long line up in the sky
if you have providence to excess

Blue sky or
May I have your zip code

until my purpose up in the sky
That you can see only the back of

though not many facts up in the sky
If you have confidence regardless all else

Up in the sky
I tell you my purposes

While theyâ€™re up in the sky
I tell you the weight of my purchases

until I purpose up in the sky
I tell you the weight of my purposes
