('sleep', 'On')

Where I sleep at times
On a snow day with my children

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
One day there is direction

That’s where I sleep at times
One year or

Interrupted sleep or
On the bandwidth I was on

While I should be sleeping 
On the timeline I was on

like flattening sleep 
One was up where it should be down
