('sleep', 'any')

Where I sleep at times
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

So I went back to sleep
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
Or the company

While I should be sleeping 
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

like flattening sleep 
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
