('sleep', 'child')

Where I sleep at times
On a snow day with my children

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
as pure as my children

So I went back to sleep
a moment of pure joy in the face of a child and the realization of what that child i

That’s where I sleep at times
even my child
