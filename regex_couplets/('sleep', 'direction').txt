('sleep', 'direction')

Where I sleep at times
Whereas direction is beside the point

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
into rotating directionless 

So I went back to sleep
Of course there is a direction

That’s where I sleep at times
stopping off in all directions
