('sleep', 'do')

Where I sleep at times
The dogs and lillies

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

So I went back to sleep
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

That’s where I sleep at times
the down arrow

Interrupted sleep or
I brought my head down

While I should be sleeping
I brought my qualities down

Looking back while I should be sleeping
which I brought down with qualities

While I should sleep not back in the results
I put my bread down

like flattening sleep 
What I do in my liesure

like sleep
here is the site of the battle of maldon
