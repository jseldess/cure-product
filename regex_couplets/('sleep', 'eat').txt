('sleep', 'eat')

Where I sleep at times
too sunny to eat ice cream

So I went back to sleep
I reach repeated expressions first

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Interrupted sleep or
Where I put it beating

While I should be sleeping 
executive breath

like flattening sleep 
And from that great distance
