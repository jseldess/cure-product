('sleep', 'he')

Where I sleep at times
But that is beside the point

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

So I went back to sleep
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

That’s where I sleep at times
to the pillow

Interrupted sleep or
 and time in the train

While I should be sleeping
I’ll get there eventually

Looking back while I should be sleeping
with my head

While I should sleep not back in the results
Back in the results pages

like flattening sleep 
talking into percents bending themselves

like sleep
talking into the cents

I like sleep
in the sense of watching

in the sense of sleep
I get through there
