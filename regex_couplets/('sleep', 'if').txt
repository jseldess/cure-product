('sleep', 'if')

Where I sleep at times
drifting away

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
if not directly on my skin

That’s where I sleep at times
drifting away from the task

Interrupted sleep or
out of the fifth page ruins

like flattening sleep 
If I take a different measure

like sleep
If I take some different measure
