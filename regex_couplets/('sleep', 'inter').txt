('sleep', 'inter')

Where I sleep at times
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

So I went back to sleep
interjecting on a day ambition

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
way high up in the inter

Interrupted sleep or
hold at intervals riding forward

Looking back while I should be sleeping
at intervals while riding forward

While I should be sleeping 
high up in the internet

like flattening sleep 
Then I saw them interview
