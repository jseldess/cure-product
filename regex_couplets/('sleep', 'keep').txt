('sleep', 'keep')

Where I sleep at times
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

So I went back to sleep
It keeps coming down thankfully

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
I keep turning back again myself

While I should be sleeping
I keep turning back

Looking back while I should be sleeping
