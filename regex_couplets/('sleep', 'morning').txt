('sleep', 'morning')

Where I sleep at times
We’ll have coffee this morning

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
When I woke up in the morning

So I went back to sleep
before morning goals

like flattening sleep
