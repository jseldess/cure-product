('sleep', 'now')

Where I sleep at times
On a snow day with my children

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
who knows the way

That’s where I sleep at times
Right now I’m the cart

Interrupted sleep or
out in the snow

like flattening sleep 
even when close to my knowing
