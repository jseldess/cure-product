('sleep', 'product')

Where I sleep at times
an impure product

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
What is an impure product

So I went back to sleep
as a cure product

That’s where I sleep at times
as a pure product

Interrupted sleep or
the least productive of myself
