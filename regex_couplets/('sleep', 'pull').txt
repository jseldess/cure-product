('sleep', 'pull')

Where I sleep at times
I’ll pull myself another personality type

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

That’s where I sleep at times
I’ll pull my data higher up

Interrupted sleep or
fish pulled out of the lake

While I should be sleeping 
I’ll pull myself higher up

like flattening sleep
