('sleep', 'really')

Where I sleep at times
because it was really dark

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
it was really sunny

So I went back to sleep
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

That’s where I sleep at times
When they really take hold of my finger

While I should be sleeping 
That’s when they really take

Looking back while I should be sleeping
without really agreeing
