('sleep', 'resume')

Where I sleep at times
So I presume the offers already

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
and can’t presume to need

That’s where I sleep at times
I resume unassimilable visions

like flattening sleep 
I resume attributable visions

like sleep
I continue to presume
