('sleep', 'side')

Where I sleep at times
But that is beside the point

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
I’m simply inside

That’s where I sleep at times
aside from the retinas

like flattening sleep 
But my not feeling the memory aside
