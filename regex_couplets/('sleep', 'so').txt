('sleep', 'so')

Where I sleep at times
I’ll pull myself another personality type

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

So I went back to sleep
When I want something

That’s where I sleep at times
You can hear it also through your leisure

Interrupted sleep or
A person from a distance

While I should be sleeping 
Even before the lesson starts

Looking back while I should be sleeping
or an available resource

like flattening sleep 
If I take some different measure

like sleep
Or in some imaginary elsewhere
