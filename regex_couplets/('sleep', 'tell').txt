('sleep', 'tell')

Where I sleep at times
Then I constellate my time family country

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
So I constellate the time family country

Interrupted sleep or
The CEO tells me to embody values

While I should be sleeping 
I had to tell them the news

like flattening sleep 
I tell you my purposes
