('sleep', 'time.')

Where I sleep at times
Then I constellate my time family country

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
only fragments of time with my children

That’s where I sleep at times
over the long time up in the sky

Interrupted sleep or
 and time in the train

While I should be sleeping
I spend time online learning to code

Looking back while I should be sleeping
On the timeline I was on

like flattening sleep 
without the long time I was accounting

like sleep
the long time I was on
