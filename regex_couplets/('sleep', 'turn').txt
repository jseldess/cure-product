('sleep', 'turn')

Where I sleep at times
in a sharp downward turn 

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
In a sharp downard turn

That’s where I sleep at times
sudden downward turn

Interrupted sleep or
I keep turning back again myself

While I should be sleeping
I keep turning back

Looking back while I should be sleeping
who knows how to turn it off
