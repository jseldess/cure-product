('sleep', 'up?')

Where I sleep at times
Ask who I am to suspend

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

So I went back to sleep
because it was really dark

That’s where I sleep at times
sudden downward turn

Interrupted sleep or
May I have your zip code

While I should be sleeping
I’ll get there eventually

Looking back while I should be sleeping
which I brought down with qualities

While I should sleep not back in the results
Remnant continuous pages

like flattening sleep 
I resume attributable visions

like sleep
If I take a different measure

I like sleep
of my purpose in versing
