('sleep', 'us')

Where I sleep at times
Ask who I am to suspend

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
asynchronous 

So I went back to sleep
because it was really dark

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

That’s where I sleep at times
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Interrupted sleep or
In a vertiginous dream

While I should be sleeping
in a continuous vertiginous dream

Looking back while I should be sleeping
In a continuous theme

While I should sleep not back in the results
Remnant continuous pages

like flattening sleep 
I have them trust in me
