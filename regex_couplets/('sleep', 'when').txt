('sleep', 'When')

Where I sleep at times
When I woke up in the morning

So I went back to sleep
When I want something

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
When we had jobs that were to earn

Interrupted sleep or
When they really take hold of my finger

While I should be sleeping 
When closed to my knowing
