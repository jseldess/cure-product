('sleep', 'you.')

Where I sleep at times
Though how can you know without direction

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
You can hear it also through your leisure

Interrupted sleep or
May I have your zip code

While I should be sleeping
That you can see only the back of

like flattening sleep 
a futile joyous white sun
