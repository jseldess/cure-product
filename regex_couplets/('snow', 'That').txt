('snow', 'That')

On a snow day with my children
That’s exaclty what I want for them

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
That is itself not still

out in the snow
That’s when they really take

out in the snow fall
That you can see only the back of

I take it out in the snow fall
That I captured an afterimage
