('snow', 'bills')

On a snow day with my children
I hear it between bills and stuff

out in the snow
I can hear it between bills and stuff

I take it out in the snow fall
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
