('snow', 'but')

On a snow day with my children
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
but not impart cynicism

out in the snow
Attributable or

out in the snow fall
but it continued

I take it out in the snow fall
but they are black spots

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
but I can hear them
