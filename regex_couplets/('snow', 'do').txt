('snow', 'do')

On a snow day with my children
in a sharp downward turn 

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
does not feel an exception

out in the snow
The dogs and lillies

out in the snow fall
What I do in my liesure

I take it out in the snow fall
Undoubtedly 

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I walk up and don’t work anymore
