('snow', 'fall')

On a snow day with my children
Then fall then summer from my face

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
Then fall then summer

out in the snow
and not falling at all

out in the snow fall
out in the snow falling face value

I take it out in the snow fall
falling off the end

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
