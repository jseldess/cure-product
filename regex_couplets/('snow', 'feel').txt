('snow', 'feel')

On a snow day with my children
conversations with our feelings

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
does not feel an exception

out in the snow
I tried to feel the key values extending 

out in the snow fall
I tried to feel the extension of key values

I take it out in the snow fall
What would I feel without that goal

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
But my not feeling the memory aside
