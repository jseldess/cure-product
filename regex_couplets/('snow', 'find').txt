('snow', 'find')

On a snow day with my children
I want to find a way to block it incoming

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
with goals I find there

out in the snow
Companies increasingly find 

I take it out in the snow fall
I even know what I would find

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
So I find myself at home
