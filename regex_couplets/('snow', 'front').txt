('snow', 'front')

On a snow day with my children
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

out in the snow
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

out in the snow fall
in front of the set afternoon

out in the snow falling face value
in front of the set of regulations

I take it out in the snow fall
And need out in front purchase
