('snow', 'here')

On a snow day with my children
I’ll get there eventually

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
One day there is direction

out in the snow
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

out in the snow fall
there was no promotion

I take it out in the snow fall
there was no walking along the pleasure

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
there was no television to hear
