('snow', 'if')

On a snow day with my children
drifting away

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
drifting does not feel an exception

out in the snow
if you have providence to excess

out in the snow fall
That company creates a life

I take it out in the snow fall
If I take a different measure

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
If I take some different measure
