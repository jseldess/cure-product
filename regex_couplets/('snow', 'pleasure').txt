('snow', 'pleasure')

On a snow day with my children
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
Which is a pleasure to never live out

out in the snow
there was no walking along the pleasure

I take it out in the snow fall
up in the television pleasure
