('snow', 'step')

On a snow day with my children
I step off the edge

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
I step over the edge

out in the snow
What the next step

out in the snow fall
What’s the next step

out in the snow falling face value
The next step 

I take it out in the snow fall
from which to step off

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
step in by the prospect
