('snow', 'tell')

On a snow day with my children
Then I constellate my time family country

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
So I constellate the time family country

out in the snow
I constellate the time

out in the snow fall
I had to tell them the news

I take it out in the snow fall
I tell you my purposes
