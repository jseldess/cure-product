('snow', 'vision')

On a snow day with my children
I had me a vision

out in the snow
The planning process for visions

out in the snow fall
The planning process is for visionaries only

out in the snow falling face value
aspirating visions

I take it out in the snow fall
there wasn’t any television 

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I resume unassimilable visions
