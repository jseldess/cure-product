('snow', 'work')

On a snow day with my children
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

Daniel Tiger on a snow day
nor work in this way daily

out in the snow
Having transitioned from leisure to work

out in the snow fall
your bid to the next highest ranked network

I take it out in the snow fall
I need the work
