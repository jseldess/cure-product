('some', 'A')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

When I want something
All of the time

the drifting is not something special
And as an extension of the values

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
BREAK

If I take some different measure
All that I can think I want

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
And reached up the screen

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
As a clone, illegally conceived

firing and connecting somewhere
CONTRACT
