('some', 'Having')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Having transitioned from leisure to work

If I take some different measure
Having been purchased out of you

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
Having seen more than 

firing and connecting somewhere
Having seen more than I can remember
