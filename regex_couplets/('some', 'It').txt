('some', 'It')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
It keeps coming down thankfully

When I want something
It has been since

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

If I take some different measure
It’s not marshal exactly

firing and connecting somewhere
