('some', 'My')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
My associations

If I take some different measure
My purpose up in the sky

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
My means without gravity

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
My daughter with her way

firing and connecting somewhere
My say to the elections
