('some', 'Or')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Or the company

If I take some different measure
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
Or alter of course the time anyway

firing and connecting somewhere
Or can have seen offering possession
