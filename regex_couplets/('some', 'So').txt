('some', 'so')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
When I want something

the drifting is not something special
Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
when we had jobs that was to churn some bread

If I take some different measure
no solid ground to continue along

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
so that nothing had gravity

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
I want to cite a poem so usual

firing and connecting somewhere
for not paying sound overwhelmed
