('some', 'That')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
That’s exaclty what I want for them

the drifting is not something special
That’s where I sleep at times

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
That’s when they really take

If I take some different measure
That I captured an afterimage

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
That are my right to say
