('some', 'There')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

When I want something
There are quarterly goals

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
There was very little physical activity

If I take some different measure
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
There are spots waiting

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
There are constant ways

firing and connecting somewhere
