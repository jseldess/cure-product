('some', 'Thou')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Though there are quarters goals

the drifting is not something special
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

If I take some different measure
Though in not many acts

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
Though we are waiting for her

firing and connecting somewhere
Though we are waiting
