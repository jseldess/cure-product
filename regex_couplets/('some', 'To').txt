('some', 'To')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
To my children Walt Whitman

the drifting is not something special
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
To neither study

If I take some different measure
Tomorrow

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
To substitute neither study

firing and connecting somewhere
To the ends of transactions
