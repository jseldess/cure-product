('some', 'We')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
We can wrestle them with their goals

the drifting is not something special
We had to say goodbye there

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
We had inhabited actually

firing and connecting somewhere
We ask say in that case
