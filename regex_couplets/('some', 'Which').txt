('some', 'Which')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Which is a measure to never live out

the drifting is not something special
Which can be pronounced to the world

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
Which can be called confidence

If I take some different measure
Which is a pleasure to never live out

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
