('some', 'across')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Before we walk across the wide field

When I want something
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

the drifting is not something special
across the retinas

If I take some different measure
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
