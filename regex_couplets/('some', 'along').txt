('some', 'along')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
bring your child along

the drifting is not something special
The days lined along company

If I take some different measure
there was no walking along the pleasure

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
formerly along time they were on

firing and connecting somewhere
along cables
