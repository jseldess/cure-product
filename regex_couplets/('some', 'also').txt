('some', 'also')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
You can hear it also through your leisure

the drifting is not something special
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

If I take some different measure
I cannot clear it also through investiture

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
also didnâ€™t really move
