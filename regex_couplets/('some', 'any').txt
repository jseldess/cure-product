('some', 'any')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

When I want something
Before anyone buys up the opening

the drifting is not something special
at any time it can drift again

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
Or the company

If I take some different measure
there wasn’t any television 

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
or alter of course the time anyway

firing and connecting somewhere
latency which doesn’t mean anything
