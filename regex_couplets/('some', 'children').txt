('some', 'children')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
on a snow day with my children

When I want something
only fragments of time with my children

the drifting is not something special
Even the children

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
my possession of my children

firing and connecting somewhere
speech my possession of my children
