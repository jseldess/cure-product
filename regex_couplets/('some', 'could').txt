('some', 'could')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
and could be mapped and weighed

If I take some different measure
until I could not tire 

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I could consume the dream

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
and we could inhabit the room easy

firing and connecting somewhere
and could be inflected with reasons
