('some', 'directly')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
if not directly on my skin

When I want something
of not directly from my skin

the drifting is not something special
But not to me directly

If I take some different measure
The sun high enough to enter directly 

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
The sun high enough to strike directly
