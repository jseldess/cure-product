('some', 'distance')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Falling from this distance

When I want something
A person from a distance

If I take some different measure
And from a weak distance

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
And from that great distance

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
