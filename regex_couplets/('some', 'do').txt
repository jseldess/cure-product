('some', 'do')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

When I want something
does not feel an exception

the drifting is not something special
in a sharp downward turn 

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
I brought my head down

If I take some different measure
What I do in my liesure

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
and it doesn’t take long

firing and connecting somewhere
latency which doesn’t mean anything
