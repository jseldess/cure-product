('some', 'earn')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
in light of learning what we see

When I want something
When we had jobs that were to earn

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
I spend time online learning to code

If I take some different measure
where you can earn more 

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
decisioned to learn 

firing and connecting somewhere
I learned my location
