('some', 'else')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
If you have confidence regardless all else

If I take some different measure
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
and elsewhere my memory

firing and connecting somewhere
elsewhere by my memory
