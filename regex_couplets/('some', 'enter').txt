('some', 'enter')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
I have entered my phone

When I want something
The sun high enough to enter directly 

If I take some different measure
I enter the flattening mirror

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I have entered my purposes

firing and connecting somewhere
I had entered my phone
