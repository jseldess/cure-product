('some', 'excess')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Did he carry one virtue to excess

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
if you have providence to excess

If I take some different measure
If articles can storm in excess

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
