('some', 'fall')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Then fall then summer from my face

When I want something
Then fall then summer

the drifting is not something special
and not falling at all

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
Face falling off the edge of the face

If I take some different measure
I take it out in the snow fall

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
