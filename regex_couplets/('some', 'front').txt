('some', 'front')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

When I want something
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

If I take some different measure
And need out in front purchase

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
behind or out front or up above
