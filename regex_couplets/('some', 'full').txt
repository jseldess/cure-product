('some', 'full')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
It keeps coming down thankfully

When I want something
I am full of potential

If I take some different measure
full of the missing words

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
still carefully

firing and connecting somewhere
