('some', 'he')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

When I want something
The sun isn’t up 

the drifting is not something special
Then I cannot see face value

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
when we had jobs that was to churn some bread

If I take some different measure
talking into pheasants bending themselves

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
While we’re up in the sky 

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

firing and connecting somewhere
where I send and receive
