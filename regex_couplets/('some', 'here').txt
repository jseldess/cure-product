('some', 'here')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Of course there is a direction

When I want something
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

the drifting is not something special
I’ll get there eventually

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
Where official policy is to catch and release

If I take some different measure
Where I take my liesure

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
there wasn’t any television 

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
Where in me did I host

firing and connecting somewhere
where I send and receive
