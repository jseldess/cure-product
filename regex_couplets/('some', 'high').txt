('some', 'high')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
way high up in the inter

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
higher up in the results

If I take some different measure
The sun high enough to enter directly 

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
The sun high enough to strike directly
