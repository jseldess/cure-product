('some', 'honor')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
over the long line I would honor

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
the simple act of honoring an accountant

If I take some different measure
which had on honor to be told

firing and connecting somewhere
