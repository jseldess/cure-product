('some', 'if')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
if not directly on my skin

When I want something
drifting does not feel an exception

the drifting is not something special
Walt Whitman drifted

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
if you have providence to excess

If I take some different measure
If I take a different measure

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
if there is anything 

firing and connecting somewhere
if that has anything
