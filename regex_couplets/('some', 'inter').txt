('some', 'inter')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

When I want something
interjecting on a day ambition

the drifting is not something special
way high up in the inter

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
hold at intervals riding forward

If I take some different measure
Then I saw them interview

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
my interfaced stand data
