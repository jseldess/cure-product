('some', 'just')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

When I want something
Theyâ€™re just not mine

the drifting is not something special
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
was not just a defeat

If I take some different measure
it was not just a defeat

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
