('some', 'let')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
But I can’t let myself treat 

the drifting is not something special
I let myself treat

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
It’s the third letter from the end

If I take some different measure
I let it remind me again

or in some imaginary elsewhere
