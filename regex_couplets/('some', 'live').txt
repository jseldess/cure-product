('some', 'live')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Which is a measure to never live out

the drifting is not something special
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
Which is a pleasure to never live out

If I take some different measure
where I send and relive aside

firing and connecting somewhere
where I blend and relive
