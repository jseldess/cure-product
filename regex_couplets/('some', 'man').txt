('some', 'man')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

the drifting is not something special
Walt Whitman drifted

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
not many face up

If I take some different measure
though not many facts up in the sky

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
They have very many choices

firing and connecting somewhere
and that man comes on to tell me
