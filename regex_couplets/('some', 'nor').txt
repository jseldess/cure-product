('some', 'nor')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
into the minority proportion of time

the drifting is not something special
over the long line I would honor

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
nor work in this way daily

If I take some different measure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
nor envy honest work

firing and connecting somewhere
which had on honor to be told
