('some', 'now')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
on a snow day with my children

When I want something
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

the drifting is not something special
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
out in the snow

If I take some different measure
I take it out in the snow fall

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
knowing the constituents

firing and connecting somewhere
that their knowing
