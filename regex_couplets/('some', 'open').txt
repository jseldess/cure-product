('some', 'open')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Before we walk across the wide opening

When I want something
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

the drifting is not something special
my desires were open

If I take some different measure
The simple act opening surmounted

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
