('some', 'others')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
others desires

the drifting is not something special
Then I can’t presume to need others

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
I presume to others

firing and connecting somewhere
Cereal and others’ health
