('some', 'pleasure')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Which is a pleasure to never live out

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
there was no walking along the pleasure

If I take some different measure
up in the television pleasure

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
