('some', 'purposes')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
I tell you my purposes

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I tell you the weight of my purposes

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
Where I host my purposes

firing and connecting somewhere
the impulse for my own purposes
