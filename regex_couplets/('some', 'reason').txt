('some', 'reason')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
reasons resources

the drifting is not something special
with reasons

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
with little reason to move

If I take some different measure
Toward the start informally given my reasons

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
More reasons around my country 

firing and connecting somewhere
and could be inflected with reasons
