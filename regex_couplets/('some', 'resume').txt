('some', 'resume')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
and can’t presume to need

the drifting is not something special
Then I can’t presume to need others

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
I resume unassimilable visions

If I take some different measure
I resume indelible tracks

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I presume to others

firing and connecting somewhere
So I presume the offers already
