('some', 'set')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
upset by Gingrich

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
in front of the set afternoon

If I take some different measure
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
Um, upset by Gingrich

firing and connecting somewhere
presets
