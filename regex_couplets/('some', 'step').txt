('some', 'step')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
I step off the edge

the drifting is not something special
What the next step

If I take some different measure
from which to step off

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
step in by the prospect

firing and connecting somewhere
phase decision step in
