('some', 'tell')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Then I constellate my time family country

the drifting is not something special
So I constellate the time family country

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
The CEO tells me to embody values

If I take some different measure
I tell you my purposes

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I tell you the weight of my purchases

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
and that man comes on to tell me 

firing and connecting somewhere
