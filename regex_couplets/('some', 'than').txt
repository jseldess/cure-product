('some', 'than')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
It keeps coming down thankfully

When I want something
than in the incoming stream

the drifting is not something special
than solid ground

If I take some different measure
Having seen more than 

firing and connecting somewhere
Having seen more than I can remember
