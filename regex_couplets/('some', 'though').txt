('some', 'though')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
As though stationary and a destination

the drifting is not something special
though it was most emphatically that

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
I had nightmares though

If I take some different measure
though not many freeze up

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I thought

firing and connecting somewhere
after though thereâ€™s no memory
