('some', 'time.')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
only fragments of time with my children

the drifting is not something special
over the long time up in the sky

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
 and time in the train

If I take some different measure
The long time I had a vision

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
or alter of course the time anyway

firing and connecting somewhere
until a happier time found
