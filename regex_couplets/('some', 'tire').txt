('some', 'tire')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

If I take some different measure
until I could not tire 

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
