('some', 'trying')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
when trying to feel the extension of key values

If I take some different measure
that I hear without trying

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I spun around trying to touch the spots

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
