('some', 'until')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
until my purpose up in the sky

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
until I could not tire 

If I take some different measure
until I could not be tired

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
until I purchase up the sky

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
until a happier time found

firing and connecting somewhere
