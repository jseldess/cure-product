('some', 'up?')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

When I want something
The sun isn’t up 

the drifting is not something special
Puffs of air

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
when we had jobs that was to churn some bread

If I take some different measure
What I do in my liesure

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
While we’re up in the sky 

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
I shivered looking up

firing and connecting somewhere
for the duration of answers
