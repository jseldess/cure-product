('some', 'us')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

When I want something
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

the drifting is not something special
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
was not just a defeat

If I take some different measure
I reuse unassimilable visions

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I wear suspenders

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

firing and connecting somewhere
useless for not having paid
