('some', 'use')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Because it was really dark

When I want something
You use the most essential parts

If I take some different measure
I reuse unassimilable visions

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I used my technology

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
trackers collecting data on users

firing and connecting somewhere
useless for not having paid
