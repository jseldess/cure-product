('some', 'walk')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Before we walk across the wide field

When I want something
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

the drifting is not something special
there was no walking along the pleasure

If I take some different measure
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
