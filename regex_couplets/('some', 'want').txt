('some', 'want')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
When I want something

the drifting is not something special
I want to cite a poem so usual

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
I want to cite a poem

If I take some different measure
all that I can think I want

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
