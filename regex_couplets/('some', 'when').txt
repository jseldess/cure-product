('some', 'When')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
When I woke up in the morning

When I want something
When we had jobs that were to earn

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
When they really take hold of my finger

If I take some different measure
When closed to my knowing

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
When I'm watching my tv 

firing and connecting somewhere
