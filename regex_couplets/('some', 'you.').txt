('some', 'you.')

In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 
Though how can you know without direction

the drifting is not something special
You can hear it also through your leisure

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
if you have providence to excess

If I take some different measure
where you can earn more 

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I tell you my purposes

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

firing and connecting somewhere
the young ripples inaudibly
