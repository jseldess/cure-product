('sound', 'he')

sound inundated for my own purchases
All parties would be held for my own purchases

and sound redundant
all parties would be held

for not paying sound overwhelmed
the resemblance

by in the sound privacy
phrase them of my possessions

by in the sounded privacy
step in by the prospect

sizes track for asking sound
bought in the sounded privacy

sizes asking for tracking sound
bought in the surrounded privacy 

buy in the sound privacy
phrase them of our possessions
