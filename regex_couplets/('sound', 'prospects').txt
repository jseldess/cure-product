('sound', 'prospects')

sound inundated for my own purchases
the impulse my own prospects

and sound redundant
the impulse for my own prospects

for not paying sound overwhelmed
speech that is of by prospects

by in the sound privacy
The prospects there already

buy in the sound privacy
the prospects being seen by me
