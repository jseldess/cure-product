('sound', 'speak')

sound inundated for my own purchases
without really speaking

and sound redundant
I speak to them

for not paying sound overwhelmed
I speak to them my possessions

by in the sound privacy
speak them of my possessions

by in the sounded privacy
I speak them of my possessions

sizes track for asking sound
