('sound', 'up?')

sound inundated for my own purchases
All parties would be held for my own purchases

and sound redundant
for my own purchases

for not paying sound overwhelmed
ground for not paying

by in the sound privacy
by in the sounded privacy

sizes track for asking sound
sizes asking for tracking sound

bought in the sounded privacy
between tracked and buffered

buy in the sound privacy
phrase them of our possessions
