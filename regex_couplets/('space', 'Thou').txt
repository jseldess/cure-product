('space', 'Thou')

in rotating directionless space
Though there are quarters goals

into rotating and directionless space
Though how can you know without direction

and then into rotating and directional space
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

in the space that it had
Though we are waiting for her

though we are breaking in the space that it had
Though we are breaking 

in the fill space
