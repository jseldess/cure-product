('space', 'us')

in rotating directionless space
russling to stay still

into rotating and directionless space
Theyâ€™re just not mine

and then into rotating and directional space
slow asynchronous

in the space that it had
I want to cite a poem so usual

though we are breaking in the space that it had
in the form filled offered in trust

in the fill space 
I have them trust in me
