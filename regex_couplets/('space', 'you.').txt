('space', 'you.')

in rotating directionless space
Though how can you know without direction

into rotating and directionless space
for how can you know without direction

into directionless space
You can hear it also through your leisure

in the space that it had
This is your voice 

though we are breaking in the space that it had
the young ripples inaudibly
