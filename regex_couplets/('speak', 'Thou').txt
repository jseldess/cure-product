('speak', 'Thou')

not speaking
Though we are waiting for her

without really speaking
Though we are breaking 

I speak to them
Though we are waiting 

I speak to them my possessions
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I speak them of my possessions
Though we can’t help waiting

speak them of my possessions
