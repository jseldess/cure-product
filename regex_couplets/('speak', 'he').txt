('speak', 'he')

not speaking
Though we are waiting for her

without really speaking
though we are breaking in the space that it had

I speak to them
But my not feeling the memory inside

would only speak willingly
only with the latency 

would speak willingly only
with the latency last night

would only willingly speak
knowing the constituents

I speak to them my possessions
and move them literally with me

I speak them of my possessions
I presume to others

speak them of my possessions
stopping into the prospect
