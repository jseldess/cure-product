('speak', 'pulse')

not speaking
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

without really speaking
I send and retrieve the impulse

I speak to them
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

would only speak willingly
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

I speak them of my possessions
I stand and retrieve the impulse

speak them of my possessions
