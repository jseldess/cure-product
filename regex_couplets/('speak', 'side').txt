('speak', 'side')

not speaking
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

without really speaking
But my not feeling the memory inside

would only speak willingly
by the side of the hosting service

I speak them of my possessions
By my feeling the memory inside

speak them of my possessions
But my not feeling the memory aside
