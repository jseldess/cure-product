('speak', 'up?')

not speaking
I thought

without really speaking
though we are breaking in the space that it had

I speak to them
But my not feeling the memory inside

would only speak willingly
with latency from constituents

would speak willingly 
all parties would be held

would speak willingly only
would only willingly speak

I speak to them my possessions
without their agreement

I speak them of my possessions
I presume to others

speak them of my possessions
in the form filled offered in trust
