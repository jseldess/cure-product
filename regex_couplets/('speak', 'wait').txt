('speak', 'wait')

not speaking
Though we are waiting for her

without really speaking
not needing to wait

would only speak willingly
Though we are waiting 

I speak to them my possessions
Though we can’t help waiting

I speak them of my possessions
waiting out front or up above 

speak them of my possessions
