('spots', 'he')

white spots on a black surface
falling off the encoded end

but they are black spots
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

black spots on a white surface
Where I take my liesure

simple black spots
Though in not many acts up in the sky

all the spots
to catch the spots

I spun around trying to touch the spots
There are spots waiting
