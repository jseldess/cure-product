('spots', 'here')

white spots on a black surface
Where I take my liesure

but they are black spots
there was no television to hear

simple black spots
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

black spots on a white surface
here is the site of the battle of maldon

all the spots
There are spots waiting
