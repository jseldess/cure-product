('stand', 'IN')

hovering above standing water
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

I stand and retrieve the impulse
By NATASHA SINGER

where I stand and relive
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
