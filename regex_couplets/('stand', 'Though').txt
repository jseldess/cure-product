('stand', 'though')

hovering above standing water
I had nightmares though

I stand and retrieve the impulse
I thought

where I stand and relive
after though thereâ€™s no memory

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
I answered what I thought

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
I answered what I thought about

but standing in memory
