('stand', 'agreed')

hovering above standing water
and to which I’ve agreed

I stand and retrieve the impulse
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

where I stand and relive
and for which the plan agreed

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
that agreed one of rest

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
that agreed home
