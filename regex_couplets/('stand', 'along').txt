('stand', 'along')

hovering above standing water
The days lined along company

I stand and retrieve the impulse
formerly along time they were on

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
formerly along my say to the elections

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
along cables

my interfaced stand data
shone formerly along time

I learned the point of standing
