('stand', 'already')

hovering above standing water
already formerly a long time

I stand and retrieve the impulse
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

where I stand and relive
already formely a long time

I stand and retrieve the impuse
with dawn already formerly nights 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
So I presume the offers already
