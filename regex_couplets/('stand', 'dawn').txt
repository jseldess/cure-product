('stand', 'dawn')

hovering above standing water
Forecasting the story before dawn

I stand and retrieve the impulse
dawn formerly

where I stand and retrieve and relive
with dawn already formerly nights 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
battery dawn nights 

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
battery dawn 

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

where I stand and relive
battery dawn nights blending themselves

my standing in data
battery dawn nights ending themselves

by my standing
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

I learned the point of standing
