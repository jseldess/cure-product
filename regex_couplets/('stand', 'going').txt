('stand', 'going')

hovering above standing water
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

I stand and retrieve the impulse
The way that she is going

where I stand and relive
The way that I am going

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
The way that I was going

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
way I was going 

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
