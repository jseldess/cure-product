('stand', 'he')

hovering above standing water
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

emerging this year from standing water
from where I can claim

emerging this year from too much standing water
to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water

I stand and retrieve the impulse
where I send and relive aside

where I stand and relive
the impulse for my own prospects

where I stand aside
the impulse to my purpose

where I stand and retrieve
aside the impulse to my purpose

where I stand aside and retrieve
where I stand and retrieve relive

I stand and retrieve the impuse
All parties would be held

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
where I send and relive

where I stand and retrieve and relive
where I am aside

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
But my not feeling the memory inside

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
Selma helps too

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
the other end transactions

my interfaced stand data
By my memory elsewhere

my standing in data
battery dawn nights ending themselves

by my standing
in memory persisting elsewhere

but standing in memory
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

I learned the point of standing
I have them lost
