('stand', 'her')

hovering above standing water
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

emerging this year from standing water
from where I can claim

emerging this year from too much standing water
there was no promotion

I stand and retrieve the impulse
where I send and relive aside

where I stand and relive
where I end

where I stand aside
where I stand and retrieve

where I stand aside and retrieve
where I stand and retrieve relive

I stand and retrieve the impuse
Elsewhere my memory

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
where I send and relive

where I stand and retrieve and relive
where I am aside

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
Though we are waiting for her

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
with her way to the ends

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
the other end transactions

my interfaced stand data
By my memory elsewhere

my standing in data
but for memory elsewhere

by my standing
in memory persisting elsewhere

but standing in memory
where rights ended themselves

I learned the point of standing
where the tongue rippled
