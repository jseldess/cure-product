('stand', 'say')

hovering above standing water
we had to say goodbye

I stand and retrieve the impulse
I ask say in that case

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
formerly along my say to the elections

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
My say to the elections

I learned the point of standing
We ask say in that case
