('stand', 'too')

hovering above standing water
emerging this year from too much standing water

to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water
learned without too much difficulty to code

I stand and retrieve the impulse
Selma knows too 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
Selma helps too

and stand and retrieve and pulse around
My daughter helps too

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
