('stand', 'wait')

hovering above standing water
There are spots waiting

I stand and retrieve the impulse
Though we are waiting for her

where I stand and relive
not needing to wait

where I stand and retrieve and relive
Though we are waiting 

to stand and retrieve and pulse around
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

I stand and retrieve and pulse around
waiting out front or up above 

I learned the point of standing
