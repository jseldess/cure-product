('standing', 'he')

hovering above standing water
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

emerging this year from standing water
from where I can claim

emerging this year from too much standing water
to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water

my standing in data
battery dawn nights ending themselves

by my standing
in memory persisting elsewhere

but standing in memory
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

I learned the point of standing
I have them lost
