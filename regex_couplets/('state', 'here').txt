('state', 'here')

explicit statements
there was no television to hear

I need an explicit statement
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

which I needed for an explicit state
but where is it

for an explicit state
I get through there

I swayed a little in my state
I get from here through there

in my state
where the tongue rippled

state kept owned impression
The prospects there already
