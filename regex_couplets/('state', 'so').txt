('state', 'so')

explicit statements
If I take some different measure

wrapped in static and explicit statements
I cannot clear it also through investiture

wrapped in static implicit statements
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I need an explicit statement
You can hear it also through your leisure

which I needed for an explicit state
I want to cite a poem so usual

for an explicit state
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I swayed a little in my state
buy in the sound privacy
