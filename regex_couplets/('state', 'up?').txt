('state', 'up?')

explicit statements
up in the television pleasure

wrapped in static and explicit statements
I cannot clear it also through investiture

wrapped in static implicit statements
though as for conversing

I need an explicit statement
until I could not be tired

which I needed for an explicit state
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

for an explicit state
you need history

like state mirror
I resume attributable visions

I swayed a little in my state
in traversing my circuit

in my state
sung reflexing

state reflexing indented in my own
lung reflexing

state kept moaned impression
my reflexing indented in my own tongue

state indented in my own
the tongue and hands

state kept owned impression
buy in the sound privacy
