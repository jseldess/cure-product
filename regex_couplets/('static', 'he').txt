('static', 'he')

wrapped in static and explicit statements
What was the last time

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I can hear them between bills and stuff

wrapped in static implicit statements
up in the television

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in the simple act of reading

You can clear it also through static seizure
The simple act opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
You can hear it also through static leisure

You can clear it also through static leisure
talking into pheasants bending themselves

wrapped in static
The long time I had a vision

while wrapped in static
You can hear it also through your leisure

while wrapped in explicit static
The long time I was a vision

while weâ€™re wrapped in static
until I purpose the horizon
