('static', 'so')

wrapped in static and explicit statements
I cannot clear it also through investiture

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
If I take some different measure

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
You can clear it also through static seizure

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure

You can clear it also through static siezure
You can hear it also through static leisure

You can clear it also through static leisure
You can hear it also through your leisure

while wrapped in static
I want to cite a poem so usual

while wrapped in explicit static
Or in some imaginary elsewhere
