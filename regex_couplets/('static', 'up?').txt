('static', 'up?')

wrapped in static and explicit statements
I cannot clear it also through investiture

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I resume indelible tracks

wrapped in static implicit statements
though as for conversing

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
black spots on a white surface

You can clear it also through static seizure
The simple act opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
You can clear it also through static siezure

You can hear it also through static leisure
You can clear it also through static leisure

wrapped in static
I resume attributable visions

while wrapped in static
You can hear it also through your leisure

while wrapped in explicit static
until I could not be tired

while weâ€™re wrapped in static
until I could not be hired
