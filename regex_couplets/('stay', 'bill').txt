('stay', 'bill')

wrestling to stay still
I hear it between bills and stuff

So stay with us
I can hear it between bills and stuff

own stays brought loyal
the bill my detuning 

I stay the right of my possessions 
between bills and stuffed animals

home stays brought loyal
bills and stuffed animals
