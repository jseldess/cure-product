('stay', 'decision')

wrestling to stay still
the planning process for decisions

So stay with us
attributable decisions

own stays brought loyal
decisioned to learn 

own that stays brought loyal
decisioned to learn back

that stays brought loyal
decisioned by the prospect

I stay the right of my elections
decisions that can be attributable

home stays brought loyal
phase decisioned by the prospect
