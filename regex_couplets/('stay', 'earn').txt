('stay', 'earn')

wrestling to stay still
When we had jobs that were to earn

So stay with us
where you can earn more 

own stays brought loyal
decisioned to learn 

own that stays brought loyal
decisioned to learn back

that stays brought loyal
phase decision for learning

I stay the right of my elections
I learned my location

home stays brought loyal
for learning by the prospect
