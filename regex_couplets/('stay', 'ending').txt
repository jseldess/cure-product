('stay', 'ending')

wrestling to stay still
I tried to feel the key values extending 

So stay with us
talking into pheasants bending themselves

own stays brought loyal
battery dawn nights blending themselves

own that stays brought loyal
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

I stay the right of my elections
