('stay', 'he')

wrestling to stay still
I canâ€™t fix them without direction

So stay with us
And as an extension of the values

own stays brought loyal
speak them of my possessions

own that stays brought loyal
stopping into the prospect

that stays brought loyal
by in the sound privacy

I stay the right of my elections
to the right of a surcharge

I stay the right of my possessions 
The right of incurred elections

home stays brought loyal
the people in home form

own stays bought loyal
the people in own form

bought stays own loyal
buy in the sound privacy
