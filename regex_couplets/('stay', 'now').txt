('stay', 'now')

wrestling to stay still
Though how can you know without direction

So stay with us
I take it out in the snow fall

own stays brought loyal
who knows the way

own that stays brought loyal
who knows how to turn it off

that stays brought loyal
that their knowing

home stays brought loyal
