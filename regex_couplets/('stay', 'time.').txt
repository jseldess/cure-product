('stay', 'time.')

wrestling to stay still
where I sleep at times

So stay with us
The long time I had a vision

own stays brought loyal
formerly a long time they were on

own that stays brought loyal
formerly along time they were on

that stays brought loyal
in the long time they were on

I stay the right of my elections
