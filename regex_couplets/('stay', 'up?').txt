('stay', 'up?')

wrestling to stay still
russling to stay still

So stay with us
And as an extension of the values

own stays brought loyal
own that stays brought loyal

that stays brought loyal
in the form filled offered in trust

I stay the right of my elections
I return not sad exactly

stay to my elections
to the right of a surcharge

I stay the right of my possessions 
I returned not sad exactly

home stays brought loyal
ensure to ourselves

own stays bought loyal
more to ourselves insure

bought stays own loyal
buy in the sound privacy
