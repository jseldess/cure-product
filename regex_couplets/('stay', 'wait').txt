('stay', 'wait')

wrestling to stay still
There are spots waiting

own stays brought loyal
Though we are waiting for her

own that stays brought loyal
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

that stays brought loyal
not needing to wait

I stay the right of my elections
waiting out front or up above 

home stays brought loyal
