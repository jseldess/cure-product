('stays', 'he')

own stays brought loyal
speak them of my possessions

own that stays brought loyal
stopping into the prospect

that stays brought loyal
by in the sound privacy

home stays brought loyal
the people in home form

own stays bought loyal
the people in own form

bought stays own loyal
buy in the sound privacy
