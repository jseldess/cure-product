('step', 'That')

I step off the edge
That’s exaclty what I want for them

I step over the edge
That’s where I sleep at times

What the next step
That you can see only the back of

What’s the next step
That company creates a life

from which to step off
That I captured an afterimage

step in by the prospect
That are my right to say

phase decision step in
