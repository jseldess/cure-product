('step', 'any')

I step off the edge
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

I step over the edge
at any time it can drift again

What the next step
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

from which to step off
That company creates a life

step in by the prospect
The many transparent pixel calls

phase decision step in
or imagined anyway

step by into the prospect
