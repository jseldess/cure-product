('step', 'assume')

I step off the edge
I assumed it was visible

I step over the edge
I assumed 

step in by the prospect
I assumed what I draw

phase decision step in
I assume the offers reliable

step by into the prospect
I assume the offers revisitable

stepping in the middle
I assumed that they were divisible

stepping off into the middle
I assume possession to others
