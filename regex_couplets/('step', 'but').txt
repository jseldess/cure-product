('step', 'but')

I step off the edge
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

I step over the edge
but not impart cynicism

What the next step
but it continued

from which to step off
but it continued rippling muscle

step in by the prospect
that decisions can be attributable

phase decision step in
but for memory elsewhere

step by into the prospect
revisions that can be attributable

stepping in the middle
but I own all that’s messageable

stepping off into the middle
decisions that can be attributable

stepping off in to the middle
