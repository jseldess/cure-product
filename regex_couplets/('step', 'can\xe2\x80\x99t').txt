('step', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

I step off the edge
I can’t fix them without direction

I step over the edge
and can’t presume to need

What the next step
That can’t be glimpsed

What’s the next step
Though we can’t help waiting

step in by the prospect
I can’t remember them

phase decision step in
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

stepping off into the middle
