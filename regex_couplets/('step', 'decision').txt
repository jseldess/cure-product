('step', 'decision')

I step off the edge
the planning process for decisions

What the next step
attributable decisions

step in by the prospect
phase decisioned by the prospect

phase decision step in
that decisions can be attributable

step by into the prospect
decisions that can be attributable

stepping in the middle
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

stepping off into the middle
