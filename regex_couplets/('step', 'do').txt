('step', 'do')

I step off the edge
The dogs and lillies

I step over the edge
does not feel an exception

What the next step
What I do in my liesure

from which to step off
Undoubtedly 

step in by the prospect
and it doesn’t take long

phase decision step in
I only think I don’t listen

stepping in the middle
