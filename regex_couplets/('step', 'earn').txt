('step', 'earn')

I step off the edge
in light of learning what we see

I step over the edge
When we had jobs that were to earn

What the next step
where you can earn more 

step in by the prospect
phase decision for learning

phase decision step in
for learning by the prospect

step by into the prospect
my daughter will learn 

stepping in the middle
