('step', 'eat')

I step off the edge
too sunny to eat ice cream

I step over the edge
But I can’t let myself treat 

What the next step
of the habits I create

What’s the next step
of the habits they create

The next step 
of the habits they create.

from which to step off
That company creates a life

step in by the prospect
for the creation of the universe

phase decision step in
