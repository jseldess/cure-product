('step', 'ending')

I step off the edge
battery dawn nights blending themselves

I step over the edge
I tried to feel the key values extending 

Whatâ€™s the next step
talking into pheasants bending themselves

from which to step off
talking into percents bending themselves

step in by the prospect
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

phase decision step in
