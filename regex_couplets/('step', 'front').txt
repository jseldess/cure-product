('step', 'front')

I step off the edge
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

I step over the edge
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

What the next step
in front of the set afternoon

Whatâ€™s the next step
in front of the set of regulations

The next step 
And need out in front purchase

step in by the prospect
behind or out front or up above

phase decision step in
