('step', 'has')

I step off the edge
conversations with our purchase

I step over the edge
It has been since

What the next step
in traversing my purchase

from which to step off
purchased out

step in by the prospect
phase decisioned by the prospect

phase decision step in
converting sight into a purchase

step by into the prospect
for my own purchases

stepping in the middle
