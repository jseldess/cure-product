('step', 'he')

I step off the edge
into the stream of pictures

I step over the edge
though there are quarters with goals

If I step on the edge
and then into rotating and directional space

If I step over the edge
what I find there

What the next step
I see only the back

Whatâ€™s the next step
The next step 

from which to step off
And as an extension of the values

step in by the prospect
phase decisioned by the prospect

phase decision step in
for learning by the prospect

step by into the prospect
stopping into the prospect

stepping in the middle
stepping off into the middle

stepping off in to the middle
I assume possession to others
