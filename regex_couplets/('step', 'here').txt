('step', 'here')

I step off the edge
Where I sleep at times

I step over the edge
though there are quarters with goals

If I step on the edge
what I find there

What the next step
there was no promotion

from which to step off
that potential is there for you

step in by the prospect
Is there a baby and a bear

phase decision step in
By my memory elsewhere

step by into the prospect
The prospects there already

stepping in the middle
traffick is there nonetheless

stepping off into the middle
