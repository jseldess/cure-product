('step', 'now')

I step off the edge
On a snow day with my children

I step over the edge
for how can you know without direction

If I step over the edge
Right now I’m the cart

What the next step
out in the snow 

What’s the next step
out in the snow fall

The next step 
I take it out in the snow fall

from which to step off
I even know what I would find

step in by the prospect
who knows how to turn it off

phase decision step in
who knows the way

step by into the prospect
