('step', 'offer')

I step off the edge
So I presume the offers already

I step over the edge
in the form filled offered in trust

step in by the prospect
in track as offer asked 

phase decision step in
I assume the offers reliable

step by into the prospect
I presume the offers

stepping in the middle
So I resume the offers already

stepping off into the middle
I assume the offers revisitable

stepping off in to the middle
Or can have seen offering possession
