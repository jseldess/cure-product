('step', 'plan')

I step off the edge
and is relentlessly planned

What the next step
I see the back of the planning process

Whatâ€™s the next step
The planning process is for visionaries only

The next step 
The planning process for visions

from which to step off
and for which the plan agreed

step in by the prospect
