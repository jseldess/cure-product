('step', 'pleasure')

I step off the edge
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

I step over the edge
Which is a pleasure to never live out

What the next step
there was no walking along the pleasure

from which to step off
up in the television pleasure

step in by the prospect
