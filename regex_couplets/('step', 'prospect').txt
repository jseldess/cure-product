('step', 'prospect')

I step off the edge
The prospects there already

I step over the edge
the impulse for my own prospects

step in by the prospect
phase decisioned by the prospect

phase decision step in
for learning by the prospect

step by into the prospect
stopping into the prospect

stepping in the middle
The prospect for careening attached

stepping off into the middle
