('step', 'prospects')

I step off the edge
The prospects there already

I step over the edge
the impulse for my own prospects

step in by the prospect
speech that is of by prospects

phase decision step in
the impulse my own prospects

step by into the prospect
the prospects being seen by me

stepping in the middle
