('step', 'rate')

I step off the edge
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

I step over the edge
and my heart rate

What the next step
and strategies not tactics

Whatâ€™s the next step
Aspirational strategy

from which to step off
I aspirate with little vision

step in by the prospect
