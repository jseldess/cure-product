('step', 'resume')

I step off the edge
So I presume the offers already

I step over the edge
and canâ€™t presume to need

What the next step
I resume unassimilable visions

step in by the prospect
I presume to others

phase decision step in
I presume the offers

stepping in the middle
So I resume the offers already

stepping off into the middle
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
