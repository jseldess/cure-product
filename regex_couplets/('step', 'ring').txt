('step', 'ring')

I step off the edge
interferring 

I step over the edge
bring your child along

What the next step
actually considering the end

step in by the prospect
firing and connecting somewhere

phase decision step in
The prospect for veering healthily

stepping in the middle
Or can have seen offering possession

stepping off into the middle
seen having or offering possession
