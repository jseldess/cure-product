('step', 'set')

I step off the edge
upset by Gingrich

What the next step
in front of the set afternoon

Whatâ€™s the next step
in front of the set of regulations

The next step 
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

step in by the prospect
presets

phase decision step in
