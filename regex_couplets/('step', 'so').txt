('step', 'so')

I step off the edge
Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type

I step over the edge
You can hear it also through your leisure

What the next step
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

from which to step off
with little reason to aspiration

step in by the prospect
by in the sound privacy

phase decision step in
sizes track for asking sound

step by into the prospect
sizes asking for tracking sound

stepping in the middle
and could be inflected with reasons

stepping off into the middle
