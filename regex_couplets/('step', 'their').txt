('step', 'their')

I step off the edge
We can wrestle them with their goals

I step over the edge
I am not allowed to see their face

What the next step
increasingly that their economic value

Whatâ€™s the next step
that their economic value 

from which to step off
without their agreement

step in by the prospect
to their other end

phase decision step in
that their knowing

step by into the prospect
