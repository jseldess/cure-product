('step', 'though')

I step off the edge
As though stationary and a destination

I step over the edge
though there are quarters with goals

If I step on the edge
though it was most emphatically that

What the next step
I had nightmares though

from which to step off
though not many freeze up

step in by the prospect
though we are waiting for her

phase decision step in
I thought

step by into the prospect
