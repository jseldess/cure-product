('step', 'time.')

I step off the edge
Where I sleep at times

I step over the edge
at any time it can drift again

What the next step
The long time I had a vision

from which to step off
without the long time I was accounting

step in by the prospect
formerly along time they were on

phase decision step in
in the long time they were on

step by into the prospect
