('step', 'visible')

I step off the edge
I assumed it was visible

I step over the edge
Iâ€™ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

What the next step
I assume the offers divisible

step in by the prospect
that they were divisible

stepping in the middle
I assumed that they were divisible

stepping off into the middle
