('step', 'you.')

I step off the edge
Though how can you know without direction

I step over the edge
for how can you know without direction

If I step over the edge
You can hear it also through your leisure

What the next step
That you can see only the back of

Whatâ€™s the next step
your bid to the next highest ranked network

from which to step off
since you can imagine movement

step in by the prospect
the young ripples inaudibly

phase decision step in
