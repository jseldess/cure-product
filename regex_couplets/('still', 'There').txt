('still', 'There')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

That is itself not still
There are quarterly goals

I love my daughter still
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

though we are still breaking in
There are constant ways
