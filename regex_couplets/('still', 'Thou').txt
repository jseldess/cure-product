('still', 'Thou')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Though there are quarters goals

That is itself not still
Though how can you know without direction

I love my daughter still
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

though we are still breaking in
Though we are waiting for her

still wash conserving
Though we can’t help waiting
