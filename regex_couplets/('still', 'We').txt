('still', 'We')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

That is itself not still
We can wrestle them with their goals

I love my daughter still
We had to say goodbye there

though we are still breaking in
We ask say in that case
