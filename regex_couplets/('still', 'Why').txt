('still', 'Why')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

That is itself not still
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

I love my daughter still
