('still', 'but')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
but not impart cynicism

I love my daughter still
but would I love her the same

though we are still breaking in
that decisions can be attributable
