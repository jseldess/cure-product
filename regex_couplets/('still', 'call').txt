('still', 'call')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
not calling or echoing for once

That is itself not still
though it was most emphatically that

I love my daughter still
Which can be called confidence

though we are still breaking in
to take the call

still wash conserving
The many transparent pixel calls
