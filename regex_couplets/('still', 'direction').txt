('still', 'direction')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
into rotating directionless 

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Of course there is a direction

That is itself not still
in rotating directionless space

wrestling to stay still
I can’t fix them without direction

I love my daughter still
stopping off in all directions
