('still', 'do')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

That is itself not still
does not feel an exception

I love my daughter still
What I do in my liesure

though we are still breaking in
and it doesn’t take long

still wash conserving
I only think I don’t listen
