('still', 'earn')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
in light of learning what we see

That is itself not still
When we had jobs that were to earn

I love my daughter still
where you can earn more 

though we are still breaking in
decisioned to learn 

still wash conserving
decisioned to learn back
