('still', 'eat')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
too sunny to eat ice cream

That is itself not still
But I can’t let myself treat 

I love my daughter still
it was not just a defeat

though we are still breaking in
for the creation of the universe

still wash conserving
burrowed about from repeated travels
