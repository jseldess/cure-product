('still', 'else')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
If you have confidence regardless all else

I love my daughter still
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

though we are still breaking in
elsewhere by my memory

still wash conserving
By my memory elsewhere

so still them
in memory elsewhere
