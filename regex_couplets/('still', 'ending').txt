('still', 'ending')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
battery dawn nights blending themselves

That is itself not still
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I love my daughter still
talking into pheasants bending themselves

though we are still breaking in
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

still wash conserving
battery dawn nights ending themselves
