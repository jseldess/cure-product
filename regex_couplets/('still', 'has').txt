('still', 'has')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
conversations with our purchase

That is itself not still
It has been since

I love my daughter still
in traversing my purchase

though we are still breaking in
for my own purchases

still wash conserving
phase decisioned by the prospect
