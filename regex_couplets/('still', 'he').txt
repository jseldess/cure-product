('still', 'he')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

That is itself not still
The edge isn’t even there

wrestling to stay still
I can’t fix them without direction

I love my daughter still
but would I love her the same

though we are still breaking in
Though we are waiting for her

still wash conserving
pre-worn and still wash them

so still watch them
Where in me pre-worn

so still them
after though there’s no memory

so still washed
 them

my in-laws still wash conserving
Where in me did I lose trust
