('still', 'here')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Of course there is a direction

That is itself not still
The edge isn’t even there

wrestling to stay still
there are quarters 

I love my daughter still
Where I take my liesure

though we are still breaking in
where I send and relive would be held

still wash conserving
Where in me pre-worn

so still them
after though there’s no memory

so still washed
Where in me did I loose

pre-worn and still wash them
Where in me did I lose trust
