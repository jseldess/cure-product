('still', 'if')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
if not directly on my skin

That is itself not still
drifting does not feel an exception

I love my daughter still
If I take a different measure

though we are still breaking in
if there is anything 

still wash conserving
if only on the way to the trash
