('still', 'know.')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
who knows the way

That is itself not still
Though how can you know without direction

I love my daughter still
I even know what I would find

though we are still breaking in
knowing the constituents

still wash conserving
who knows how to turn it off
