('still', 'man')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

I love my daughter still
not many face up

though we are still breaking in
and that man comes on to tell me 

still wash conserving
The many transparent pixel calls
