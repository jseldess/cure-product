('still', 'move')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
since I can imagine movement

I love my daughter still
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

though we are still breaking in
myself moved literally as it is

still wash conserving
not literally moved about

so still them
also didn’t really move
