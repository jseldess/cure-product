('still', 'now')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
on a snow day with my children

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
who knows the way

That is itself not still
Though how can you know without direction

I love my daughter still
I take it out in the snow fall

though we are still breaking in
knowing the constituents

still wash conserving
who knows how to turn it off
