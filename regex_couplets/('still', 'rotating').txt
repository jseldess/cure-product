('still', 'rotating')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
into rotating directionless 

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Rather it itself is rotating

wrestling to stay still
not rotating

wrestling me to stay still
into rotating and directionless space

I love my daughter still
