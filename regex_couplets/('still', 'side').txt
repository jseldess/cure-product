('still', 'side')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
I’m simply inside

That is itself not still
aside from the retinas

I love my daughter still
actually considering the end

though we are still breaking in
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

still wash conserving
But my not feeling the memory inside
