('still', 'so')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

That is itself not still
You can hear it also through your leisure

I love my daughter still
If I take some different measure

though we are still breaking in
sound inundated for my own purchases

still wash conserving
so still watch them

my in-laws still wash conserving
so still them

so still washed
by in the sound privacy
