('still', 'space')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
in rotating directionless space

wrestling to stay still
into rotating and directionless space

I love my daughter still
in the space that it had

though we are still breaking in
though we are breaking in the space that it had

still wash conserving
in the fill space
