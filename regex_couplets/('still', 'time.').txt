('still', 'time.')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
only fragments of time with my children

That is itself not still
where I sleep at times

I love my daughter still
The long time I had a vision

though we are still breaking in
until a happier time found

still wash conserving
formerly along time they were on
