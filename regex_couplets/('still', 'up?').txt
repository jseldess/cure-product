('still', 'up?')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

That is itself not still
As though stationary and a destination

wrestling to stay still
russling to stay still

I love my daughter still
but would I love her the same

though we are still breaking in
I thought

still wash conserving
still carefully

so still them
after though there’s no memory

so still washed
in the form filled offered must

pre-worn and still wash them
Where in me did I lose trust
