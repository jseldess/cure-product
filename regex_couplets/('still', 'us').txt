('still', 'us')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
asynchronous 

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

That is itself not still
russling to stay still

I love my daughter still
I reuse unassimilable visions

though we are still breaking in
in the form filled offered in trust

still wash conserving
in the form filled offered trust

so still them
in the form filled offered must

pre-worn and still wash them
Where in me did I lose trust
