('still', 'use')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
because it was really dark

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
You use the most essential parts

I love my daughter still
I reuse unassimilable visions

though we are still breaking in
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

still wash conserving
