('still', 'walk')

But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.
Before we walk across the wide field

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Before we walk across the wide opening

That is itself not still
there was no walking along the pleasure

though we are still breaking in
