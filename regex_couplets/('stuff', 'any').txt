('stuff', 'any')

between bills and stuffed animals
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

I hear it between bills and stuff
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I can hear it between bills and stuff
there wasnâ€™t any television 

I can hear them between bills and stuff
not many face up

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

and stuff up in the sky
Though in not many acts

bills and stuffed animals
