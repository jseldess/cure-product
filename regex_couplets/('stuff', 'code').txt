('stuff', 'code')

between bills and stuffed animals
as long as I have access to the code

I hear it between bills and stuff
learned without too much difficulty to code

I can hear it between bills and stuff
falling off the encoded end

I can hear them between bills and stuff
encoded off the end

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

bills and stuffed animals
