('stuff', 'he')

between bills and stuffed animals
by the private preambles

I hear it between bills and stuff
off the edge of the world

I can hear it between bills and stuff
The ads in mine

Would I love the same stuff
falling off the encoded end

I can hear them between bills and stuff
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

and stuff up in the sky
Though in not many acts up in the sky

bills and stuffed animals
I presume the offers
