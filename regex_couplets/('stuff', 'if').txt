('stuff', 'if')

between bills and stuffed animals
drifting away

I hear it between bills and stuff
learned without too much difficulty to code

I can hear it between bills and stuff
If I take a different measure

I can hear them between bills and stuff
If I take some different measure

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
if there is anything 

bills and stuffed animals
if only on the way to the trash
