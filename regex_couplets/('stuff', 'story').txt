('stuff', 'story')

between bills and stuffed animals
I told her a story, she drew waves.

I hear it between bills and stuff
Forecasting the story before dawn

I can hear it between bills and stuff
as far back as my history heard

I can hear them between bills and stuff
You need history

bills and stuffed animals
