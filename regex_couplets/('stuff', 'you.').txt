('stuff', 'you.')

between bills and stuffed animals
Though how can you know without direction

I hear it between bills and stuff
That you can see only the back of

I can hear it between bills and stuff
where you can earn more 

I can hear them between bills and stuff
You can hear it also through your leisure

bills and stuffed animals
