('suspend', 'he')

Ask who I am to suspend
But that is beside the point

I am to end my connections suspended live
Where I sleep at times

I suspend live connections to you
Whereas direction is beside the point

I suspend my connections to you
The dogs and lillies

I wear suspenders
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

suspenders
where I need gravity
