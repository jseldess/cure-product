('suspend', 'up?')

Ask who I am to suspend
I am to end my connections suspended live

I suspend live connections to you
But that is beside the point

I suspend my connections to you
I upend my connections to you

I wear suspenders
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

suspenders
I tell you my purposes
