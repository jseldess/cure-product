('take', 'but')

I take hold of my finger
Attributable or

When they really take hold of my finger
but the sun isn’t up

If I take a different measure
but they are black spots

If I take some different measure
but I can hear them

to take the call
that decisions can be attributable

and it doesn’t take long
but for memory elsewhere
