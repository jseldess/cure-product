('take', 'if')

I take hold of my finger
if you have providence to excess

When they really take hold of my finger
out of the fifth page ruins

If I take a different measure
If I take some different measure

Where I take my liesure
if there is anything 

to take the call
if that has anything

and it doesnâ€™t take long
if only on the way to the trash
