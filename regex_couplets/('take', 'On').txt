('take', 'On')

I take hold of my finger
One year or

When they really take hold of my finger
On the bandwidth I was on

Thatâ€™s when they really take
On the timeline I was on

If I take a different measure
On the other hand

If I take some different measure
One was up where it should be down

to take the call
