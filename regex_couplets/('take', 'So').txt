('take', 'so')

I take hold of my finger
reasons resources

When they really take hold of my finger
or an available resource

If I take a different measure
If I take some different measure

Where I take my liesure
no solid ground to continue along

I take it out in the snow fall
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

to take the call
firing and connecting somewhere

and it doesn’t take long
also didn’t really move
