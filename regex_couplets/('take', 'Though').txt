('take', 'though')

I take hold of my finger
though it was most emphatically that

When they really take hold of my finger
I had nightmares though

If I take a different measure
though not many freeze up

If I take some different measure
though not many facts up in the sky

to take the call
I thought

and it doesnâ€™t take long
I answered what I thought
