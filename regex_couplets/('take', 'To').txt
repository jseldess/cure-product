('take', 'To')

I take hold of my finger
To neither study

When they really take hold of my finger
To that impossible place

If I take a different measure
Tomorrow

If I take some different measure
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

to take the call
To the ends of transactions

and it doesnâ€™t take long
To the right of determined elections
