('take', 'Which')

I take hold of my finger
Which can be pronounced to the world

When they really take hold of my finger
Which is a pleasure to never live out

If I take a different measure
Which can be called confidence

to take the call
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

and it doesnâ€™t take long
