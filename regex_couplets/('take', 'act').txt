('take', 'act')

I take hold of my finger
I was enjoined to act again

If I take a different measure
actually considering the end

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I refuse indelible tracts

If I take some different measure
though not many facts up in the sky

to take the call
The ends of my transactions

and it doesn’t take long
I turn not sad exactly
