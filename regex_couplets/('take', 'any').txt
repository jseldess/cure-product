('take', 'any')

I take hold of my finger
Or the company

When they really take hold of my finger
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

If I take a different measure
there wasn’t any television 

If I take some different measure
not many face up

to take the call
latency which doesn’t mean anything

and it doesn’t take long
or imagined anyway
