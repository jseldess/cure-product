('take', 'are')

I take hold of my finger
barely outlines

If I take a different measure
but they are black spots

If I take some different measure
I believe I can prepare for it

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
There are spots waiting

to take the call
Though we are waiting 

and it doesn’t take long
That are my right to say
