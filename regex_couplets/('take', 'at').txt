('take', 'at')

I take hold of my finger
So I constellate the time family country

When they really take hold of my finger
That’s when they really take

If I take a different measure
What I do in my liesure

Where I take my liesure
What would I feel without that goal

If I take some different measure
that I can hear

I take it out in the snow fall
I even know what I would find

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
What was the last time

to take the call
where I am aside at least

and it doesn’t take long
burrowed about from repeated travels
