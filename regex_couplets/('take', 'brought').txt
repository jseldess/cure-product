('take', 'brought')

I take hold of my finger
I brought my head down

When they really take hold of my finger
which I brought down with qualities

Thatâ€™s when they really take
I brought my qualities down

If I take a different measure
own stays brought loyal

to take the call
at home brought into privacy
