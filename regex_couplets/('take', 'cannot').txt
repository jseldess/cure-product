('take', 'cannot')

I take hold of my finger
Then I cannot see face value

When they really take hold of my finger
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

If I take a different measure
I cannot clear it also through investiture

If I take some different measure
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

to take the call
in that I cannot remember
