('take', 'code')

I take hold of my finger
May I have your zip code

When they really take hold of my finger
learned without too much difficulty to code

If I take a different measure
falling off the encoded end

If I take some different measure
encoded off the end

Where I take my liesure
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

to take the call
zipcode

and it doesnâ€™t take long
