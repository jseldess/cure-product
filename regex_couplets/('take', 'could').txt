('take', 'could')

I take hold of my finger
and could be mapped and weighed

When they really take hold of my finger
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

Thatâ€™s when they really take
until I could not tire 

If I take a different measure
until I could not be tired

If I take some different measure
until I could not be hired

to take the call
and could be inflected with reasons
