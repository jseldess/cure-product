('take', 'count')

I take hold of my finger
So I constellate the time family country

When they really take hold of my finger
I brought my count down

Thatâ€™s when they really take
without the long time I was accounting

Where I take my liesure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

If I take a different measure
around my country 

If I take some different measure
without the long time I was on accounting

to take the call
