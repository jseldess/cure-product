('take', 'dawn')

I take hold of my finger
Forecasting the story before dawn

If I take a different measure
battery dawn nights blending themselves

If I take some different measure
dawn already formerly nights 

to take the call
dawn formerly

and it doesnâ€™t take long
with dawn already formerly nights
