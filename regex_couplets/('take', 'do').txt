('take', 'do')

I take hold of my finger
I brought my head down

When they really take hold of my finger
which I brought down with qualities

That’s when they really take
I brought my qualities down

If I take a different measure
What I do in my liesure

Where I take my liesure
Undoubtedly 

If I take some different measure
I walk up and don’t work anymore

to take the call
and it doesn’t take long
