('take', 'eat')

I take hold of my finger
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

When they really take hold of my finger
executive breath

If I take a different measure
it was not just a defeat

If I take some different measure
And from that great distance

to take the call
for the creation of the universe

and it doesnâ€™t take long
burrowed about from repeated travels
