('take', 'ending')

I take hold of my finger
I tried to feel the key values extending 

If I take a different measure
talking into pheasants bending themselves

Where I take my liesure
talking into percents bending themselves

If I take some different measure
walking into percents blending themselves

to take the call
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

and it doesnâ€™t take long
battery dawn nights blending themselves
