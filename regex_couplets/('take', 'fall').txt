('take', 'fall')

I take hold of my finger
Then fall then summer

When they really take hold of my finger
and not falling at all

If I take a different measure
I take it out in the snow fall

If I take some different measure
falling off the end

Where I take my liesure
falling off the end of the world

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
