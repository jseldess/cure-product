('take', 'from')

I take hold of my finger
A person from a distance

When they really take hold of my finger
out from below the fold

If I take a different measure
from which to step off

If I take some different measure
I get from here through there

to take the call
from no one point

and it doesnâ€™t take long
and relive from burrowed travels
