('take', 'get')

I take hold of my finger
I’ll get there eventually

When they really take hold of my finger
I’ll get there ruins

If I take a different measure
I get through there

If I take some different measure
I get from here through there

to take the call
forgetting decisions 

and it doesn’t take long
forgettable
