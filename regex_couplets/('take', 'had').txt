('take', 'had')

I take hold of my finger
When we had jobs that were to earn

When they really take hold of my finger
I had me a vision

If I take a different measure
The long time I had a vision

Where I take my liesure
I had a vision

If I take some different measure
we had to say goodbye

to take the call
which had on honor to be told

and it doesnâ€™t take long
I had entered my phone
