('take', 'have')

I take hold of my finger
if you have providence to excess

When they really take hold of my finger
If you have confidence regardless all else

If I take a different measure
I have them lost

If I take some different measure
I have supporters

to take the call
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

and it doesnâ€™t take long
I have them trust in me
