('take', 'he')

I take hold of my finger
Then fall then summer

When they really take hold of my finger
I search with my head

That’s when they really take
with my head

If I take a different measure
talking into pheasants bending themselves

Where I take my liesure
I take it out in the snow fall

If I take some different measure
The long time I had a vision

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
without the long time I was accounting

to take the call
between the drug store and the 

and it doesn’t take long
But my not feeling the memory aside
