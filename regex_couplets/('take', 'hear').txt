('take', 'hear')

I take hold of my finger
and my heart rate

When they really take hold of my finger
I hear it between bills and stuff

If I take a different measure
I can hear it between bills and stuff

If I take some different measure
that I can hear

Where I take my liesure
that I hear without trying

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
as far back as my history heard

to take the call
In my heart did I lose trust

and it doesn’t take long
