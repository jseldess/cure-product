('take', 'her')

I take hold of my finger
To neither study

When they really take hold of my finger
I’ll get there eventually

That’s when they really take
higher up in the results

If I take a different measure
Where I take my liesure

I take it out in the snow fall
there was no promotion

If I take some different measure
On the other hand

to take the call
where I am aside at least

and it doesn’t take long
where I send and retrieve relive
