('take', 'here')

I take hold of my finger
I’ll get there eventually

When they really take hold of my finger
I’ll get there ruins

If I take a different measure
Where I take my liesure

I take it out in the snow fall
there was no promotion

If I take some different measure
there was no television to hear

to take the call
where I am aside at least

and it doesn’t take long
where I send and retrieve relive
