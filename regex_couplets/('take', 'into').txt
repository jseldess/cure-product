('take', 'into')

I take hold of my finger
into a brigand and a murderer

When they really take hold of my finger
into the well controlled climate

If I take a different measure
talking into pheasants bending themselves

Where I take my liesure
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

If I take some different measure
Then I saw into you

to take the call
deep into pathways from repeated travels

and it doesn’t take long
into liminal reflexing
