('take', 'know')

I take hold of my finger
I even know what I would find

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
even when close to my knowing

If I take some different measure
When closed to my knowing

to take the call
knowing the constituents

and it doesn’t take long
that their knowing
