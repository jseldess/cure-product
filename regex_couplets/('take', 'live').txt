('take', 'live')

I take hold of my finger
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

If I take a different measure
Which is a pleasure to never live out

If I take some different measure
where I send and relive aside

to take the call
where I send and retrieve relive

and it doesnâ€™t take long
and relive from burrowed travels
