('take', 'me')

I take hold of my finger
Then fall then summer

When they really take hold of my finger
In a continuous theme

That’s when they really take
a similar desire against me

If I take a different measure
If I take some different measure

Where I take my liesure
I had me a vision

I take it out in the snow fall
I resume unassimilable visions

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
The long time I had a vision

to take the call
dawn formerly

and it doesn’t take long
But my not feeling the memory aside
