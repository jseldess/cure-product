('take', 'night')

I take hold of my finger
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

When they really take hold of my finger
blue and sun again a second, then night

If I take a different measure
battery dawn nights blending themselves

If I take some different measure
dawn already formerly nights 

to take the call
last night

and it doesnâ€™t take long
battery dawn nights ending themselves
