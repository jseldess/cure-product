('take', 'no')

I take hold of my finger
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

When they really take hold of my finger
in a continuous vertiginous dream

That’s when they really take
not back in the results

If I take a different measure
I take it out in the snow fall

If I take some different measure
may not be ingrained

Where I take my liesure
may not be engrained

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

to take the call
from no one point

and it doesn’t take long
But my not feeling the memory aside
