('take', 'nor')

I take hold of my finger
nor work in this way daily

When they really take hold of my finger
over the long line I would honor

If I take a different measure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

If I take some different measure
nor envy honest work

to take the call
which had on honor to be told

and it doesnâ€™t take long
