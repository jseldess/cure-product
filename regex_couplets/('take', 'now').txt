('take', 'now')

I take hold of my finger
Right now I’m the cart

If I take a different measure
I take it out in the snow fall

If I take some different measure
I even know what I would find

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
even when close to my knowing

to take the call
knowing the constituents

and it doesn’t take long
that their knowing
