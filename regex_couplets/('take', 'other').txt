('take', 'other')

I take hold of my finger
I’ll pull myself another personality type

If I take a different measure
On the other hand

If I take some different measure
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

to take the call
I presume to others

and it doesn’t take long
Cereal and others’ health
