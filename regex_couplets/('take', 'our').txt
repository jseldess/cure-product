('take', 'our')

I take hold of my finger
reasons resources

When they really take hold of my finger
or an available resource

If I take a different measure
You can hear it also through your leisure

If I take some different measure
or alter of course the time anyway

to take the call
Who throws contours away

and it doesnâ€™t take long
phrase them of our possessions
