('take', 'over')

I take hold of my finger
hovering above standing water

If I take a different measure
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

If I take some different measure
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

to take the call
for not paying sound overwhelmed

and it doesnâ€™t take long
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
