('take', 'resume')

I take hold of my finger
I resume unassimilable visions

Where I take my liesure
I resume indelible tracks

If I take a different measure
I resume attributable visions

If I take some different measure
I continue to presume

to take the call
I presume to others

and it doesnâ€™t take long
So I presume the offers already
