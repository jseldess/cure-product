('take', 'ring')

I take hold of my finger
hovering above standing water

If I take a different measure
actually considering the end

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
the simple act of honoring an accountant

If I take some different measure
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

to take the call
firing and connecting somewhere

and it doesn’t take long
The prospect for veering healthily
