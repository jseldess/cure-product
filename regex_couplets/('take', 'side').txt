('take', 'side')

I take hold of my finger
aside from the retinas

If I take a different measure
actually considering the end

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
But my not feeling the memory aside

to take the call
where I am aside at least

and it doesn’t take long
where I am aside
