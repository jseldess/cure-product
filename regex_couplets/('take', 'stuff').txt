('take', 'stuff')

I take hold of my finger
I hear it between bills and stuff

If I take a different measure
I can hear it between bills and stuff

If I take some different measure
I can hear them between bills and stuff

Where I take my liesure
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

to take the call
between bills and stuffed animals
