('take', 'themselves')

I take hold of my finger
talking into pheasants bending themselves

Where I take my liesure
talking into percents bending themselves

If I take a different measure
walking into percents blending themselves

If I take some different measure
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

and it doesnâ€™t take long
battery dawn nights blending themselves

to take the call
battery dawn nights ending themselves
