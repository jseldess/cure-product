('take', 'time.')

I take hold of my finger
So I constellate the time family country

When they really take hold of my finger
On the timeline I was on

If I take a different measure
The long time I had a vision

Where I take my liesure
without the long time I was accounting

I take it out in the snow fall
The long time I was a vision

If I take some different measure
which is the long time I was on

to take the call
until a happier time found

and it doesnâ€™t take long
in the long time they were on
