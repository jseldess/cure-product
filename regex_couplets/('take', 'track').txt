('take', 'track')

I take hold of my finger
I reuse indelible tracks 

Where I take my liesure
The first track

If I take a different measure
I refuse indelible tracks

If I take some different measure
I resume indelible tracks

to take the call
which as tracked befitted 

and it doesnâ€™t take long
which as tracked befitted phased
