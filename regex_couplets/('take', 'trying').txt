('take', 'trying')

I take hold of my finger
when trying to feel the extension of key values

If I take a different measure
that I hear without trying

I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking
wearing trying talking into it

If I take some different measure
I spun around trying to touch the spots

to take the call
