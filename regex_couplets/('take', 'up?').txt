('take', 'up?')

I take hold of my finger
Then fall then summer

When they really take hold of my finger
While I should be sleeping 

That’s when they really take
Looking back while I should be sleeping

If I take a different measure
in traversing my purchase

If I take some different measure
What I do in my liesure

Where I take my liesure
I take it out in the snow fall

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
I resume unassimilable visions

to take the call
between the drug store and the 

and it doesn’t take long
But my not feeling the memory aside
