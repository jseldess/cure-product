('take', 'us')

I take hold of my finger
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

When they really take hold of my finger
in a continuous vertiginous dream

That’s when they really take
In a continuous theme

If I take a different measure
I reuse unassimilable visions

Where I take my liesure
because there was no solid ground to continue along

If I take some different measure
I reuse indelible tracks 

I take it out in the snow fall
I refuse indelible tracts

to take the call
useless for not having paid

and it doesn’t take long
radiating from housing
