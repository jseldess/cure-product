('take', 'use')

I take hold of my finger
You use the most essential parts

When they really take hold of my finger
I reuse unassimilable visions

Where I take my liesure
because there was no solid ground to continue along

If I take a different measure
I reuse indelible tracks 

I take it out in the snow fall
I refuse indelible tracts

If I take some different measure
I used my technology

to take the call
useless for not having paid

and it doesnâ€™t take long
