('take', 'vision')

I take hold of my finger
I had me a vision

If I take a different measure
I reuse unassimilable visions

Where I take my liesure
there wasn’t any television 

If I take some different measure
I resume unassimilable visions

I take it out in the snow fall
The long time I had a vision

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
up in the television pleasure

to take the call
joined in my television
