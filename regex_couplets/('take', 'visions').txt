('take', 'visions')

I take hold of my finger
The planning process for visions

If I take a different measure
I reuse unassimilable visions

Where I take my liesure
I resume unassimilable visions

I take it out in the snow fall
I resume attributable visions

If I take some different measure
attributable visions

to take the call
visions that can be attainable
