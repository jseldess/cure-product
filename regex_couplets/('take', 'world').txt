('take', 'world')

I take hold of my finger
Which can be pronounced to the world

When they really take hold of my finger
off the edge of the world

Thatâ€™s when they really take
off the end of the world

If I take a different measure
hauling off the end of the world

If I take some different measure
falling off the end of the world

Where I take my liesure
the opinions in my world

to take the call
