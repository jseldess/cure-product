('take', 'You')

I take hold of my finger
You use the most essential parts

When they really take hold of my finger
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

If I take a different measure
You can hear it also through static leisure

If I take some different measure
You can hear it also through your leisure

to take the call
You can have seen offering
