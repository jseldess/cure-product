('take', 'you.')

I take hold of my finger
if you have providence to excess

When they really take hold of my finger
That you can see only the back of

If I take a different measure
where you can earn more 

If I take some different measure
You can hear it also through your leisure

to take the call
the young ripples inaudibly
