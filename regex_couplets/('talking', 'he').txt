('talking', 'he')

talking into pheasants bending themselves
The long time I had a vision

talking into percents bending themselves
without the long time I was accounting

wearing trying talking into it
I enter the flattening mirror

talking int
which is the long time I was on

talking into the cents
battery dawn nights blending themselves

talking into the sense
in the sense of watching
