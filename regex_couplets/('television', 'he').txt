('television', 'he')

there wasn’t any television 
– The Pixies

up in the television pleasure
though not many facts up in the sky

up in the television
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
I cannot hear it between bills

joined in my television
By my memory elsewhere
