('television', 'up?')

there wasn’t any television 
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

up in the television pleasure
though not many facts up in the sky

up in the television
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

joined in my television
Selma’s squirrel and chickadee
