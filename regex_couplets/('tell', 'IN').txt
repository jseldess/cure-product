('tell', 'IN')

Then I constellate my time family country
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

So I constellate the time family country
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

I had to tell them the news
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

I tell you my purposes
By NATASHA SINGER

and that man comes on to tell me 
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
