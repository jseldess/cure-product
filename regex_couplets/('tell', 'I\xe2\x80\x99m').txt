('tell', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

Then I constellate my time family country
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

So I constellate the time family country
Right now I’m the cart

I constellate the time
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

I had to tell them the news
where I’m watching my tv
