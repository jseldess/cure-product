('tell', 'They')

Then I constellate my time family country
Theyâ€™re just not mine

So I constellate the time family country
They are called aspirational

I had to tell them the news
They can be waived

I tell you the weight of my purposes
They can be weighed

I tell you the weight of my purchases
They have very many choices

and that man comes on to tell me 
They were filters
