('tell', 'Which')

Then I constellate my time family country
Which is a measure to never live out

So I constellate the time family country
Which can be pronounced to the world

I constellate the time
Which can be called confidence

The CEO tells me to embody values
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I tell you my purposes
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
