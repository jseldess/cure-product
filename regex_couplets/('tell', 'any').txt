('tell', 'any')

Then I constellate my time family country
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

So I constellate the time family country
Or the company

I had to tell them the news
That company creates a life

I tell you my purposes
there wasn’t any television 

I tell you the weight of my purchases
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I tell you the weight of my purposes
without any further damage

and that man comes on to tell me 
latency which doesn’t mean anything
