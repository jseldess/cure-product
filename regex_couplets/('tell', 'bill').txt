('tell', 'bill')

Then I constellate my time family country
I hear it between bills and stuff

I had to tell them the news
I can hear it between bills and stuff

So I constellate the time family country
billowing in the cloud

I tell you my purposes
until the bill came

and that man comes on to tell me 
the bill my detuning
