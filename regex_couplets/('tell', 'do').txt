('tell', 'do')

Then I constellate my time family country
in a sharp downward turn 

So I constellate the time family country
The dogs and lillies

I constellate the time
I brought my head down

The CEO tells me to embody values
which I brought down with qualities

I had to tell them the news
What I do in my liesure

I tell you my purposes
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I tell you the weight of my purchases
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

I tell you the weight of my purposes
One was up where it should be down

I tell you where I need gravity
here is the site of the battle of maldon

and that man comes on to tell me 
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything
