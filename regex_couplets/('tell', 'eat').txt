('tell', 'eat')

Then I constellate my time family country
too sunny to eat ice cream

So I constellate the time family country
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I constellate the time
was not just a defeat

The CEO tells me to embody values
Where I put it beating

I had to tell them the news
That company creates a life

I tell you my purposes
And from that great distance

I tell you the weight of my purchases
for the creation of the universe

and that man comes on to tell me 
burrowed about from repeated travels
