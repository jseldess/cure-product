('tell', 'he')

Then I constellate my time family country
where I sleep at times

So I constellate the time family country
The South Carolina primary 

I constellate the time
When we had jobs that were to earn

The CEO tells me to embody values
Or the company

I had to tell them the news
And as an extension of the values

I tell you my purposes
they can be waived

I tell you the weight of my purchases
until I purpose up in the sky

I tell you the weight of my purposes
They can be weighed

I tell you where I need gravity
Is the weight of my purchases

and that man comes on to tell me 
â€“ The Rolling Stones
