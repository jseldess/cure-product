('tell', 'here')

Then I constellate my time family country
where I sleep at times

So I constellate the time family country
I’ll get there eventually

I constellate the time
Where official policy is to catch and release

The CEO tells me to embody values
Where I put it beating

I had to tell them the news
there was no promotion

I tell you my purposes
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I tell you the weight of my purchases
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

I tell you the weight of my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity

and that man comes on to tell me 
there wasn’t any television
