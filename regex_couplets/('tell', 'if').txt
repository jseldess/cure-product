('tell', 'if')

Then I constellate my time family country
drifting away

So I constellate the time family country
if you have providence to excess

I constellate the time
if he had not carried one virtue 

The CEO tells me to embody values
out of the fifth page ruins

I had to tell them the news
That company creates a life

I tell you my purposes
if there is anything 

and that man comes on to tell me 
if only on the way to the trash
