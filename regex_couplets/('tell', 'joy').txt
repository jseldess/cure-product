('tell', 'joy')

Then I constellate my time family country
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

So I constellate the time family country
I was enjoying acting against myself

I had to tell them the news
a futile joyous white sun

I tell you my purposes
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

and that man comes on to tell me
