('tell', 'just')

Then I constellate my time family country
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

So I constellate the time family country
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I constellate the time
was not just a defeat

The CEO tells me to embody values
I just got a letter

I had to tell them the news
it was not just a defeat

I tell you my purposes
