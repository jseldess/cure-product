('tell', 'now')

Then I constellate my time family country
On a snow day with my children

So I constellate the time family country
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

I constellate the time
out in the snow

I had to tell them the news
I take it out in the snow fall

I tell you my purposes
knowing the constituents

and that man comes on to tell me 
who knows the way
