('tell', 'pleasure')

Then I constellate my time family country
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

So I constellate the time family country
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I constellate the time
there was no walking along the pleasure

I tell you my purposes
