('tell', 'pull')

Then I constellate my time family country
I’ll pull myself another personality type

So I constellate the time family country
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

I constellate the time
fish pulled out of the lake

The CEO tells me to embody values
I’ll pull myself higher up

I had to tell them the news
