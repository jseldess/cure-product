('tell', 'should')

Then I constellate my time family country
While I should be sleeping

The CEO tells me to embody values
Looking back while I should be sleeping

I had to tell them the news
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

I tell you my purposes
One was up where it should be down

I tell you the weight of my purposes
they should rise up

and that man comes on to tell me
