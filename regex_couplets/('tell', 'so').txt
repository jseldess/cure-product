('tell', 'so')

Then I constellate my time family country
reasons resources

So I constellate the time family country
Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type

I constellate the time
with reasons

The CEO tells me to embody values
dislocated and a person from a distance

I had to tell them the news
with little reason to aspiration

I tell you my purposes
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I tell you the weight of my purchases
so that nothing had gravity

and that man comes on to tell me 
so still watch them
