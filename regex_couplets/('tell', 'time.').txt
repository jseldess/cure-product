('tell', 'time.')

Then I constellate my time family country
where I sleep at times

So I constellate the time family country
over the long time up in the sky

I constellate the time
 and time in the train

The CEO tells me to embody values
I spend time online learning to code

I had to tell them the news
The long time I had a vision

I tell you my purposes
or alter of course the time anyway

and that man comes on to tell me 
formerly along time they were on
