('tell', 'tire')

Then I constellate my time family country
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I had to tell them the news
until I could not tire 

So I constellate the time family country
for to tire as far back as my history

I tell you my purposes
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

and that man comes on to tell me
