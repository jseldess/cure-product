('tell', 'up?')

Then I constellate my time family country
reasons resources

So I constellate the time family country
The South Carolina primary 

I constellate the time
not one virtue to excess

The CEO tells me to embody values
But not to me directly

I had to tell them the news
but it continued rippling muscle

I tell you my purposes
And for an ungraspable time

I tell you the weight of my purchases
until I purpose up in the sky

I tell you the weight of my purposes
weight of my purposes

I tell you where I need gravity
Is the weight of my purchases

and that man comes on to tell me 
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going
