('tell', 'us')

Then I constellate my time family country
asynchronous 

So I constellate the time family country
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I constellate the time
was not just a defeat

The CEO tells me to embody values
You use the most essential parts

I had to tell them the news
but it continued rippling muscle

I tell you my purposes
I wear suspenders

I tell you the weight of my purchases
a futile joyous white sun

and that man comes on to tell me 
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
