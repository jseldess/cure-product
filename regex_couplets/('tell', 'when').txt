('tell', 'When')

Then I constellate my time family country
When I woke up in the morning

So I constellate the time family country
When we had jobs that were to earn

The CEO tells me to embody values
When they really take hold of my finger

I had to tell them the news
When closed to my knowing

I tell you my purposes
When I'm watching my tv 

and that man comes on to tell me
