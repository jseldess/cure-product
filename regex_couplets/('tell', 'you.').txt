('tell', 'you.')

Then I constellate my time family country
Though how can you know without direction

So I constellate the time family country
You can hear it also through your leisure

I constellate the time
if you have providence to excess

The CEO tells me to embody values
That you can see only the back of

I had to tell them the news
since you can imagine movement

I tell you my purposes
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I tell you the weight of my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity

and that man comes on to tell me 
the young ripples inaudibly
