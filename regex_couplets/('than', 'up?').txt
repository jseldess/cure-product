('than', 'up?')

It keeps coming down thankfully
Then fall then summer

than in the incoming stream
The sun isnâ€™t up 

than solid ground
because there was no solid ground to continue along

Having seen more than 
I presume to others

Having seen more than I can remember 
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I have seen more than I can remember
that decisions can be attributable
