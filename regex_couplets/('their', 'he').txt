('their', 'he')

We can wrestle them with their goals
We can rest there in them with their goals

I am not allowed to see their face
of the economic value

I can see only the back of their economic value
Their economic value

increasingly that their economic value
is a function of the strength

that their economic value 
of the habits they create.

without their agreement
if there is anything 

to their other end
the contours exchange with you

to their other contours
who know the ways to their other end

who know the way to their other end
Who knows the way

that their knowing
The weight kept moaned impression
