('their', 'here')

We can wrestle them with their goals
We can rest there in them with their goals

I am not allowed to see their face
there was no promotion

that their economic value 
There was very little physical activity

without their agreement
if there is anything 

to their other end
There are no constant waves

that their knowing
where the tongue rippled
