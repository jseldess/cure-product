('their', 'man')

We can wrestle them with their goals
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

I am not allowed to see their face
not many face up

without their agreement
and that man comes on to tell me 

to their other end
The many transparent pixel calls

who know the way to their other end
The many transparent pixels call

that their knowing
