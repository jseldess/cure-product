('their', 'now')

We can wrestle them with their goals
Though how can you know without direction

I am not allowed to see their face
out in the snow

I can see only the back of their economic value
I take it out in the snow fall

without their agreement
who knows the way

to their other end
who know the ways to their other end

who know the way to their other end
that their knowing
