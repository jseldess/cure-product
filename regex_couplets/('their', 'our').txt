('their', 'our')

We can wrestle them with their goals
You can hear it also through your leisure

I am not allowed to see their face
with four key value pairs

increasingly that their economic value
your bid to the next highest ranked network

that their economic value 
reasons resources

without their agreement
Who throws contours away

to their other end
the contours exchange with you

to their other contours
phrase them of our possessions
