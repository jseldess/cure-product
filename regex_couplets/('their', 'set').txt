('their', 'set')

We can wrestle them with their goals
upset by Gingrich

I am not allowed to see their face
in front of the set afternoon

their economic value
in front of the set of regulations

increasingly that their economic value
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

without their agreement
presets
