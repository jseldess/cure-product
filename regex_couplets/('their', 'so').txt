('their', 'so')

We can wrestle them with their goals
You can hear it also through your leisure

I am not allowed to see their face
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

that their economic value 
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

without their agreement
so still watch them

to their other end
by in the sound privacy

that their knowing
buy in the sound privacy
