('them', 'And')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
And put in place as though stationary

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
And as an extension of the values

In a continuous theme
And make myself a visible

or argued for them at least
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I designed them to hold up my underwear
And from a weak distance

Then I saw them interview
