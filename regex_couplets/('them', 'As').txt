('them', 'As')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
As though stationary and a destination

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
Assimilable or

In a continuous theme
Aspirational strategy

or argued for them at least
As an extension of the values

I had to tell them the news
As a clone, illegally conceived

I designed them to hold up my underwear
