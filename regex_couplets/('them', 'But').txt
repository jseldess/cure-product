('them', 'but')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
but not impart cynicism

In a continuous theme
but the sun isnâ€™t up

or argued for them at least
but it continued rippling muscle

I had to tell them the news
but would I love her the same

talking into pheasants bending themselves
but they are black spots

I can hear them between bills and stuff
but I can hear them

the opacity given to them
but where is it

Then I saw them interview
I resume attributable visions

talking into percents bending themselves
attributable visions

I designed them to hold up my underwear
that decisions can be attributable

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
but for memory elsewhere

battery dawn nights ending themselves
but standing in memory

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
decisions that can be attributable

phrase them
revisions that can be attributable

before I act on them
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
