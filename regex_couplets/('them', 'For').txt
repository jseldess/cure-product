('them', 'For')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

In a continuous theme
Forecasting the story before dawn

or argued for them at least
For an ungraspable time

I designed them to hold up my underwear
For Mitt Romney

Then I saw them interview
For my own purchases

I speak to them
Formerly a way like this one

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

before I act on them
