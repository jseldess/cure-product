('them', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I’m simply inside

I can’t fix them without direction
Right now I’m the cart

In a continuous theme
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

or argued for them at least
where I’m watching my tv

battery dawn nights ending themselves
