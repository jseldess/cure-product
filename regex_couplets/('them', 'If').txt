('them', 'if')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
if not directly on my skin

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
drifting does not feel an exception

In a continuous theme
out of the fifth page ruins

or argued for them at least
That company creates a life

I had to tell them the news
Life is with people

talking into pheasants bending themselves
If I take a different measure

I can hear them between bills and stuff
If I take some different measure

but I can hear them
if there is anything 

Then I saw them interview
if you have providence

I speak to them
if that has anything

I speak to them my possessions
if only on the way to the trash

before I act on them
