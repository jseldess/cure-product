('them', 'IN')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

In a continuous theme
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

or argued for them at least
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

I designed them to hold up my underwear
By NATASHA SINGER

I speak to them
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

I speak them of my possessions
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
