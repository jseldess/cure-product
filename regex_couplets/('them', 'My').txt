('them', 'My')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
My associations

or argued for them at least
My purpose up in the sky

I designed them to hold up my underwear
My means without gravity

Then I saw them interview
My daughter with her way

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
My say to the elections

abjure them with determining 
My state kept loaned impression

I have them lost
