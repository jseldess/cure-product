('them', 'so')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
When I want something

That’s exaclty what I want for them
You can hear it also through your leisure

In a continuous theme
or an available resource

or argued for them at least
with little reason to move

I had to tell them the news
with little reason to aspiration

talking into pheasants bending themselves
no solid ground to continue along

I can hear them between bills and stuff
If I take some different measure

but I can hear them
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

the opacity given to them
More reasons 

Then I saw them interview
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I designed them to hold up my underwear
so that nothing had gravity

I speak to them
firing and connecting somewhere

I speak to them my possessions
so still watch them

so still them
so still washed

 them
by in the sound privacy

phrase them of my possessions
by in the sounded privacy

I speak them of my possessions
sizes track for asking sound

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
sizes asking for tracking sound

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
also didn’t really move

battery dawn nights ending themselves
buy in the sound privacy

phrase them of our possessions
and could be inflected with reasons

before I act on them
bought in the sounded privacy
