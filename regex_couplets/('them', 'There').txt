('them', 'There')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

That’s exaclty what I want for them
There are quarterly goals

In a continuous theme
There was very little physical activity

or argued for them at least
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

talking into pheasants bending themselves
There are spots waiting

Then I saw them interview
There are constant ways

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
