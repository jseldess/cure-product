('them', 'Thou')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Though there are quarters goals

I can’t fix them without direction
Though how can you know without direction

In a continuous theme
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Though in not many acts

the opacity given to them
Though we are waiting for her

Then I saw them interview
Though we are breaking 

I speak to them
Though we are waiting 

I speak to them my possessions
Though we can’t help waiting

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
