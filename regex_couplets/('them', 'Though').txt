('them', 'though')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
As though stationary and a destination

I can’t fix them without direction
though there are quarters with goals

In a continuous theme
I had nightmares though

or argued for them at least
though not many freeze up

talking into pheasants bending themselves
though not many facts up in the sky

I can hear them between bills and stuff
though as for conversing

but I can hear them
though in not many acts up in the sky

the opacity given to them
I thought

Then I saw them interview
though we are still breaking in

I speak to them
after though there’s no memory

 them
though we are waiting for her

I speak them of my possessions
I answered what I thought

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
I answered what I thought about

battery dawn nights ending themselves
