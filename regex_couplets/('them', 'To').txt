('them', 'To')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
To my children Walt Whitman

In a continuous theme
To that impossible place

or argued for them at least
Tomorrow

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

the opacity given to them
To neither study

Then I saw them interview
To the ends of transactions

I speak them of my possessions
To the ends of my transactions

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
To the right of determined elections

I have them lost
