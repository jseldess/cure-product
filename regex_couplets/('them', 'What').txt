('them', 'what')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
in light of learning what we see

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
what I find there

In a continuous theme
I invited most of what came next

or argued for them at least
I even know what I would find

talking into pheasants bending themselves
what literally moved

pre-worn and still wash them
In what part did I lose trust

I speak them of my possessions
I answered what I thought

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
I assumed what I draw

speak them of my possessions
I answered what I thought about

battery dawn nights ending themselves
to return what I bought

I have them lost
