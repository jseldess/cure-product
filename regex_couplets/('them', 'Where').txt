('them', 'Where')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Where official policy is to catch and release

In a continuous theme
Where I take my liesure

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Where I lead gravity

I designed them to hold up my underwear
Where I need gravity

Then I saw them interview
Where I host my purposes

I speak to them
Where in me did I host

I speak to them my possessions
Where in me did I lose

pre-worn and still wash them
Where in me pre-worn

so still them
Where in me did I loose

so still watch them
Where in me did I lose trust

I speak them of my possessions
