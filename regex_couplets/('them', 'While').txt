('them', 'while')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Looking back while I should be sleeping

In a continuous theme
at intervals while riding forward

or argued for them at least
while wrapped in static

talking into pheasants bending themselves
while wrapped in explicit static

talking into percents bending themselves
while consuming damage

I designed them to hold up my underwear
I answered while interfaced

battery dawn nights ending themselves
for a while to listen already

before I act on them
