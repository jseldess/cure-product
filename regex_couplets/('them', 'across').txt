('them', 'across')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Before we walk across the wide opening

That’s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field

I can’t fix them without direction
across the retinas

or argued for them at least
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

the opacity given to them
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
