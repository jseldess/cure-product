('them', 'act')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light

That’s exaclty what I want for them
One day was actually

I can’t fix them without direction
I was enjoined to act again myself

In a continuous theme
I was enjoined to act again

or argued for them at least
There was very little physical activity

I had to tell them the news
actually considering the end

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I refuse indelible tracts

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I refuse indelible contracts

but I can hear them
Though in not many acts

the opacity given to them
we had inhabited actually

Then I saw them interview
The ends of my transactions

I speak to them
to the ends of my transactions

I speak them of my possessions
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

pre-worn and still wash them
To the ends of transactions

speak them of my possessions
to the ends of actions

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
I turn not sad exactly

battery dawn nights ending themselves
I return not sad exactly

abjure them with determining 
I returned not sad exactly

I have them lost
before I act on them

phrase them of our possessions
