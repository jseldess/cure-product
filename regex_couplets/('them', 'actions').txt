('them', 'actions')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
conversations with our reactions

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
to the ends of my transactions

Then I saw them interview
The ends of my transactions

I speak to them
To the ends of transactions

I speak them of my possessions
to the ends of actions

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
