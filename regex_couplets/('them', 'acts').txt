('them', 'acts')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I refuse indelible tracts

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I refuse indelible contracts

talking into pheasants bending themselves
though not many facts up in the sky

but I can hear them
Though in not many acts

the opacity given to them
