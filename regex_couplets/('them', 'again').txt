('them', 'again')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
at any time it can drift again

In a continuous theme
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

or argued for them at least
I am enjoined to act again

I had to tell them the news
I let it remind me again

I designed them to hold up my underwear
