('them', 'agreed')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
and to which I’ve agreed

Then I saw them interview
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

I speak to them
and for which the plan agreed

I speak to them my possessions
that agreed one of rest

speak them of my possessions
and to which the plan agreed

pre-worn and still wash them
that agreed home

I can’t remember them
that agreed to one the people

phrase them of our possessions
