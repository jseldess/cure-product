('them', 'along')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
bring your child along

In a continuous theme
The days lined along company

I had to tell them the news
there was no walking along the pleasure

talking into pheasants bending themselves
formerly along time they were on

I speak them of my possessions
formerly along my say to the elections

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
drawn formerly along 

speak them of my possessions
along cables

battery dawn nights ending themselves
shone formerly along time

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
formerly along the time they were on

abjure them with determining
