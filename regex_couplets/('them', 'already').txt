('them', 'already')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
already formerly a long time

Then I saw them interview
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

I speak to them
with dawn already formerly nights 

I speak to them my possessions
dawn already formerly nights 

I speak them of my possessions
So I presume the offers already

phrase them of our possessions
The prospects there already

before I act on them
