('them', 'also')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
You can hear it also through your leisure

In a continuous theme
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I cannot clear it also through investiture

but I can hear them
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

talking into pheasants bending themselves
You can hear it also through static leisure

the opacity given to them
also didnâ€™t really move

battery dawn nights ending themselves
