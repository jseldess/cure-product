('them', 'any')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

That’s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field

I can’t fix them without direction
at any time it can drift again

In a continuous theme
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

or argued for them at least
The days aligned for company

I had to tell them the news
That company creates a life

talking into pheasants bending themselves
there wasn’t any television 

I can hear them between bills and stuff
not many face up

but I can hear them
in not many tracks up in the sky

the opacity given to them
So I work and don’t look any

Then I saw them interview
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I designed them to hold up my underwear
without any further damage

I speak to them
latency which doesn’t mean anything

I speak to them my possessions
if there is anything 

I speak them of my possessions
if that has anything

pre-worn and still wash them
The many transparent pixel calls

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
or imagined anyway

I have them lost
