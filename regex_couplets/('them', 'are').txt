('them', 'are')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Though there are quarters goals

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
there are quarters 

We can wrestle them with their goals
though there are quarters with goals

In a continuous theme
barely outlines

or argued for them at least
The days are long

I had to tell them the news
but they are black spots

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I believe I can prepare for it

I can hear them between bills and stuff
There are spots waiting

Then I saw them interview
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

I speak to them
Though we are waiting 

I speak to them my possessions
Though we are waiting for her

I speak them of my possessions
still carefully

so still them
There are constant ways

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
That are my right to say

abjure them with determining 
careening between the preambles

before I act on them
