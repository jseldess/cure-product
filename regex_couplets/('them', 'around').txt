('them', 'around')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Spinning around the heart

In a continuous theme
around my country 

Then I saw them interview
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I designed them to hold up my underwear
around the dogs and lillies

I speak to them
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
and around redundant

I speak to them my possessions
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
