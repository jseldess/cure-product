('them', 'aside')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
aside from the retinas

or argued for them at least
But my not feeling the memory aside

I speak to them
where I send and relive aside

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I am aside

I speak to them my possessions
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

battery dawn nights ending themselves
