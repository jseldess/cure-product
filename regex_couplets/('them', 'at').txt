('them', 'at')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
and not falling at all

That’s exaclty what I want for them
and at my desk

I can’t fix them without direction
into rotating and directionless space

We can wrestle them with their goals
and then into rotating and directional space

In a continuous theme
That’s when they really take

or argued for them at least
aspirating with visions

I had to tell them the news
That company creates a life

talking into pheasants bending themselves
What would I feel without that goal

I can hear them between bills and stuff
all that I can think I want

but I can hear them
What I do in my liesure

the opacity given to them
attesting this is a chance

talking into percents bending themselves
like flattening sleep 

walking into percents blending themselves
in the sense of watching

I have them lost
that having been after content

I designed them to hold up my underwear
that hold and wish to hold

Then I saw them interview
trackers collecting data on users

I speak to them
where I am aside at least

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
burrowed about from repeated travels

I speak to them my possessions
latency which doesn’t mean anything

I speak them of my possessions
that is of I am possessed

speak them of my possessions
I designated 

pre-worn and still wash them
so still watch them

so still them
In what part did I lose trust

phrase them of my possessions
we ask say in that case

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
I assumed what I draw

battery dawn nights ending themselves
radiating from housing

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
I answered what I thought

where rights ended themselves
stopped light with validated fields

abjure them with determining 
to return what I bought

I have them trust in me
I swayed a little in my state

I can’t remember them
I learned my location

phrase them of our possessions
decisions that can be attributable

phrase them
that agreed home

before I act on them
at home brought into privacy
