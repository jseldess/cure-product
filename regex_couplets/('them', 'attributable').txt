('them', 'attributable')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I resume attributable visions

talking into pheasants bending themselves
attributable visions

I designed them to hold up my underwear
that decisions can be attributable

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
decisions that can be attributable

phrase them
revisions that can be attributable

before I act on them
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
