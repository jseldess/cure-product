('them', 'bill')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I hear it between bills and stuff

or argued for them at least
I can hear it between bills and stuff

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I can hear them between bills and stuff

but I can hear them
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

the opacity given to them
billowing in the cloud

talking into percents bending themselves
until the bill came

Then I saw them interview
the bill my detuning 

abjure them with determining 
between bills and stuffed animals

phrase them
bills and stuffed animals

before I act on them
