('them', 'bills')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I hear it between bills and stuff

or argued for them at least
I can hear it between bills and stuff

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I can hear them between bills and stuff

but I can hear them
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

the opacity given to them
between bills and stuffed animals

phrase them
bills and stuffed animals

before I act on them
