('them', 'blend')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
walking into percents blending themselves

I have them lost
where I blend and relive

I speak to them my possessions
where lights blended themselves

where rights ended themselves
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

drawn formerly rights blended themselves
