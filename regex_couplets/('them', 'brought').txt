('them', 'brought')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I brought my head down

In a continuous theme
I brought my count down

or argued for them at least
own stays brought loyal

speak them of my possessions
own that stays brought loyal

phrase them of my possessions
that stays brought loyal

I speak them of my possessions
at home brought into privacy

phrase them of our possessions
home stays brought loyal

before I act on them
