('them', 'buy')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Before anyone buys up the opening

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
We had to buy there

I designed them to hold up my underwear
buy in the surrounded privacy

I speak them of my possessions
buy in the sound privacy

phrase them of our possessions
