('them', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I can’t fix them without direction

We can wrestle them with their goals
and can’t presume to need

In a continuous theme
That can’t be glimpsed

or argued for them at least
Though we can’t help waiting

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
I can’t remember them

I have them lost
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
