('them', 'cannot')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Then I cannot see face value

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I cannot clear it also through investiture

but I can hear them
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

talking into pheasants bending themselves
in that I cannot remember 

before I act on them
