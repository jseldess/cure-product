('them', 'child')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
about my children’s consumption

That’s exaclty what I want for them
especially in a child

I can’t fix them without direction
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

In a continuous theme
even my child

I designed them to hold up my underwear
my possession of my children

I speak them of my possessions
speech my possession of my children

speak them of my possessions
