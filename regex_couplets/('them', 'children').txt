('them', 'children')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
about my children’s consumption

That’s exaclty what I want for them
on a snow day with my children

I can’t fix them without direction
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

In a continuous theme
Even the children

I designed them to hold up my underwear
my possession of my children

I speak them of my possessions
speech my possession of my children

speak them of my possessions
