('them', 'code')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
as long as I have access to the code

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
May I have your zip code

In a continuous theme
learned without too much difficulty to code

or argued for them at least
falling off the encoded end

talking into pheasants bending themselves
encoded off the end

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

Then I saw them interview
zipcode

I speak them of my possessions
