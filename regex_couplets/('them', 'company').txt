('them', 'company')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Or the company

In a continuous theme
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

or argued for them at least
The days aligned for company

I had to tell them the news
That company creates a life

talking into pheasants bending themselves
