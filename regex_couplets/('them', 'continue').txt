('them', 'continue')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
but it continued

or argued for them at least
but it continued rippling muscle

I had to tell them the news
no solid ground to continue along

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I continue to presume

I designed them to hold up my underwear
Then I continue to dream then

Then I saw them interview
