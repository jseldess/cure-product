('them', 'could')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
and could be mapped and weighed

In a continuous theme
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

or argued for them at least
until I could not tire 

I can hear them between bills and stuff
until I could not be tired

talking into pheasants bending themselves
until I could not be hired

talking into percents bending themselves
I could in effect credit

I have them lost
I could consume the dream

I designed them to hold up my underwear
and we could inhabit the room easy

Then I saw them interview
and could be inflected with reasons

before I act on them
