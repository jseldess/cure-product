('them', 'count')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Then I constellate my time family country

In a continuous theme
I brought my count down

or argued for them at least
without the long time I was accounting

talking into pheasants bending themselves
the simple act of honoring an accountant

the opacity given to them
around my country 

Then I saw them interview
without the long time I was on accounting

talking into percents bending themselves
So I constellate the time family country

I speak to them
