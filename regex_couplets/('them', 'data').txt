('them', 'data')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I’ll pull my data higher up

In a continuous theme
I’ll pull my data

or argued for them at least
The days of private data

I had to tell them the news
The days of public data

talking into pheasants bending themselves
trackers collecting data on users

I speak to them
my interfaced stand data

battery dawn nights ending themselves
my standing in data

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
