('them', 'day')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
on a snow day with my children

That’s exaclty what I want for them
One day there is direction

I can’t fix them without direction
I argued the days felt longer

or argued for them at least
The days aligned for company

I had to tell them the news
The days were long aligned

talking into pheasants bending themselves
The day

Then I saw them interview
at least most days

battery dawn nights ending themselves
