('them', 'decision')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
the planning process for decisions

or argued for them at least
attributable decisions

I designed them to hold up my underwear
forgetting decisions 

speak them of my possessions
decisioned to learn 

phrase them of my possessions
decisioned by the prospect

I speak them of my possessions
that decisions can be attributable

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
decisioned to learn back

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
decisions that can be attributable

phrase them
phase decisioned by the prospect

before I act on them
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
