('them', 'decisioned')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
decisioned to learn 

speak them of my possessions
decisioned to learn back

phrase them of my possessions
decisioned by the prospect

I speak them of my possessions
phase decisioned by the prospect

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
phase decisioned

before I act on them
