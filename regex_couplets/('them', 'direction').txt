('them', 'direction')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Of course there is a direction

That’s exaclty what I want for them
One day there is direction

I can’t fix them without direction
into rotating and directionless space

We can wrestle them with their goals
Though how can you know without direction

In a continuous theme
stopping off in all directions
