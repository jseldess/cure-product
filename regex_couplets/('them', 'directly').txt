('them', 'directly')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
if not directly on my skin

That’s exaclty what I want for them
of not directly from my skin

I can’t fix them without direction
But not to me directly

In a continuous theme
The sun high enough to enter directly 

the opacity given to them
The sun high enough to strike directly
