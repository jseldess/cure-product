('them', 'do')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In a sharp downard turn

That’s exaclty what I want for them
does not feel an exception

In a continuous theme
I put my bread down

or argued for them at least
What I do in my liesure

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Undoubtedly 

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I walk up and don’t work anymore

the opacity given to them
So I work and don’t look any

Then I saw them interview
here is the site of the battle of maldon

I designed them to hold up my underwear
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I speak to them
and it doesn’t take long

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
latency which doesn’t mean anything

I speak to them my possessions
I only think I don’t listen

before I act on them
