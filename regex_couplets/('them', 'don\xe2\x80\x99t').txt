('them', 'don\xe2\x80\x99t')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

or argued for them at least
I walk up and don’t work anymore

the opacity given to them
So I work and don’t look any

Then I saw them interview
I only think I don’t listen

before I act on them
