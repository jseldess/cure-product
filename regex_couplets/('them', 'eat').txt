('them', 'eat')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I reach repeated expressions first

That’s exaclty what I want for them
But I can’t let myself treat 

In a continuous theme
executive breath

or argued for them at least
That company creates a life

I had to tell them the news
it was not just a defeat

the opacity given to them
And from that great distance

I designed them to hold up my underwear
And from a great distance

Then I saw them interview
for the creation of the universe

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
burrowed about from repeated travels

I speak to them my possessions
from cables reheated travels

battery dawn nights ending themselves
