('them', 'edge')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Face falling off the edge of the face

That’s exaclty what I want for them
The edge is put in place

I can’t fix them without direction
I step off the edge

We can wrestle them with their goals
I step over the edge

In a continuous theme
off the edge of the world

or argued for them at least
