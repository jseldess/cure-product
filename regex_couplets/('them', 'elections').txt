('them', 'elections')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
on my way to elections

I speak them of my possessions
formerly my way to the elections

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
on a way to the elections

speak them of my possessions
formally a way to the elections

abjure them with determining 
The right of incurred elections

I have them lost
