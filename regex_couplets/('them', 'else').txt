('them', 'else')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
If you have confidence regardless all else

In a continuous theme
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I designed them to hold up my underwear
and elsewhere my memory

Then I saw them interview
elsewhere my purposes

I speak to them
elsewhere by my memory

pre-worn and still wash them
By my memory elsewhere

so still them
in memory elsewhere

battery dawn nights ending themselves
but for memory elsewhere

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
