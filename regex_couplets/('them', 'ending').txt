('them', 'ending')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I tried to feel the key values extending 

or argued for them at least
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I can hear them between bills and stuff
talking into percents bending themselves

walking into percents blending themselves
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

I speak to them my possessions
battery dawn nights ending themselves

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
