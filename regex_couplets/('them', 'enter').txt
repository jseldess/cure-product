('them', 'enter')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
The sun high enough to enter directly 

the opacity given to them
I enter the flattening mirror

talking into percents bending themselves
I have entered my purposes

Then I saw them interview
I have entered my purchases

I speak to them
I have entered my phone

so still them
I had entered my phone

battery dawn nights ending themselves
