('them', 'fall')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Then fall then summer from my face

That’s exaclty what I want for them
Then fall then summer

I can’t fix them without direction
and not falling at all

In a continuous theme
Face falling off the edge of the face

or argued for them at least
falling off the encoded end

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I take it out in the snow fall

I can hear them between bills and stuff
falling off the end of the world

but I can hear them
