('them', 'far')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
as far as I can see

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
as far back as my history heard

I can hear them between bills and stuff
for to tire as far back as my history

talking into percents bending themselves
in welfare and hope

abjure them with determining
