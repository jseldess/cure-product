('them', 'feel')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
conversations with our feelings

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
does not feel an exception

In a continuous theme
I tried to feel the key values extending 

or argued for them at least
What would I feel without that goal

talking into pheasants bending themselves
But my not feeling the memory aside

I speak to them
But my not feeling the memory inside

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
which feels most comfortable

I speak to them my possessions
which feels more comfortable

I speak them of my possessions
which is what feels most comfortable

pre-worn and still wash them
which I feel formerly about for

so still them
By my feeling the memory inside

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
But my feeling the memory aside

battery dawn nights ending themselves
