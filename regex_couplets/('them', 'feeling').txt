('them', 'feeling')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
conversations with our feelings

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
But my not feeling the memory aside

I speak to them
But my not feeling the memory inside

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
By my feeling the memory inside

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
But my feeling the memory aside

battery dawn nights ending themselves
