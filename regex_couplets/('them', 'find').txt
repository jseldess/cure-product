('them', 'find')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I want to find a way to block it incoming

That’s exaclty what I want for them
I can find a way to block it

I can’t fix them without direction
with goals I find there

In a continuous theme
Companies increasingly find 

or argued for them at least
I even know what I would find

talking into pheasants bending themselves
So I find myself at home

phrase them of our possessions
