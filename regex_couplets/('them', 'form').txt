('them', 'form')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
There are performance reviews

In a continuous theme
Toward the start informally given my reasons

the opacity given to them
already formerly a long time

Then I saw them interview
A way formerly like this one

I speak to them
dawn formerly

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
in the form filled offered in trust

I speak to them my possessions
with dawn already formerly nights 

I speak them of my possessions
dawn already formerly nights 

pre-worn and still wash them
in the form filled offered trust

so still them
in the form filled offered must

so still watch them
in the form filled offered

speak them of my possessions
formerly a way

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
drawn formerly a long time

phrase them of my possessions
which I feel formerly about for

battery dawn nights ending themselves
addition were filters formerly

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

dawn formerly rights blended themselves
drawn formerly rights blended themselves

dawn formerly nights ended themselves
drawn formerly rights

ended themselves
drawn formerly rights ended themselves

where rights ended themselves
drawn formerly along 

abjure them with determining 
own best form

I canâ€™t remember them
own best form to ourselves

phrase them of our possessions
