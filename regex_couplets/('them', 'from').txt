('them', 'from')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Then fall then summer from my face

That’s exaclty what I want for them
from the incoming stream

I can’t fix them without direction
Falling from this distance

In a continuous theme
out from below the fold

or argued for them at least
aside from the retinas

I had to tell them the news
from which to step off

talking into pheasants bending themselves
promoting from home to a new job

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I get from here through there

I designed them to hold up my underwear
And from a weak distance

Then I saw them interview
breaking from my constituents

I speak to them
from no one point

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
and relive from burrowed travels

I speak to them my possessions
burrowed about from repeated travels

battery dawn nights ending themselves
radiating from housing

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
