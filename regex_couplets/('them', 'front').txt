('them', 'front')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

In a continuous theme
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

or argued for them at least
And need out in front purchase

I designed them to hold up my underwear
behind or out front or up above

I have them lost
