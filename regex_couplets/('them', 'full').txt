('them', 'full')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
It keeps coming down thankfully

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
I am full of potential

or argued for them at least
with full potential to movement

I had to tell them the news
full of aspirations

talking into pheasants bending themselves
full of the missing words

Then I saw them interview
still carefully

so still them
