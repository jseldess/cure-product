('them', 'get')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I’ll get there eventually

In a continuous theme
I’ll get there ruins

or argued for them at least
I get through there

I have them lost
I get from here through there

I designed them to hold up my underwear
forgetting decisions 

speak them of my possessions
forgettable

before I act on them
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
