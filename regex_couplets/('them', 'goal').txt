('them', 'goal')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Though there are quarters goals

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
We can wrestle them with their goals

We can rest there in them with their goals
with goals

In a continuous theme
before morning goals

or argued for them at least
What would I feel without that goal

talking into pheasants bending themselves
