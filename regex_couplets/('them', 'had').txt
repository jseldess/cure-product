('them', 'had')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
If he had not carried one virtue

In a continuous theme
I had me a vision

or argued for them at least
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

I had to tell them the news
The long time I had a vision

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I had a vision

talking into percents bending themselves
we had to say goodbye

I designed them to hold up my underwear
that nothing had gravity

Then I saw them interview
in the face that I had

I speak to them
which had on honor to be told

I speak to them my possessions
in the space that it had

pre-worn and still wash them
I had entered my phone

battery dawn nights ending themselves
