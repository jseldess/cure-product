('them', 'has')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
conversations with our purchase

That’s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field

I can’t fix them without direction
It has been since

In a continuous theme
in traversing my purchase

talking into pheasants bending themselves
purchased out

I designed them to hold up my underwear
until I purchase up the sky

Then I saw them interview
the impulse for my own purchases

I speak to them
for my own purchases

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
if that has anything

I speak to them my possessions
phase decisioned by the prospect

I speak them of my possessions
converting sight into a purchase

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
phase decisioned

battery dawn nights ending themselves
at the site of a purchase

I have them lost
which as tracked befitted phased

before I act on them
