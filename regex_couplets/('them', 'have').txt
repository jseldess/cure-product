('them', 'have')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
before we can have a retroactive

That’s exaclty what I want for them
as long as I have access to the code

I can’t fix them without direction
if you have providence to excess

In a continuous theme
If you have confidence regardless all else

talking into percents bending themselves
I have them lost

I have them trust in me
I have supporters

I designed them to hold up my underwear
I have a memory between the day

Then I saw them interview
if you have providence

I speak to them
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

pre-worn and still wash them
I have entered my phone

so still them
I have turned it off

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
I have seen more than I can remember
