('them', 'he')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light

That’s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field

I can’t fix them without direction
there are quarters 

We can wrestle them with their goals
We can rest there in them with their goals

In a continuous theme
I put my head down

or argued for them at least
The days aligned for company

I had to tell them the news
And as an extension of the values

talking into pheasants bending themselves
The long time I had a vision

I can hear them between bills and stuff
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

but I can hear them
without the long time I was accounting

the opacity given to them
but where is it

Then I saw them interview
only in the case

talking into percents bending themselves
which is the long time I was on

walking into percents blending themselves
talking into the cents

I have them lost
I have them trust in me

I designed them to hold up my underwear
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I speak to them
But my not feeling the memory inside

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
But my not feeling the memory aside

I speak to them my possessions
and move them literally with me

I literally move them
without their agreement

I speak them of my possessions
I presume to others

speak them of my possessions
stopping into the prospect

pre-worn and still wash them
so still watch them

so still them
after though there’s no memory

 them
Where in me did I loose

phrase them of my possessions
decisioned by the prospect

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
where rights ended themselves

where lights blended themselves
time they were on

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in memory elsewhere

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

dawn formerly rights blended themselves
drawn formerly rights blended themselves

dawn formerly nights ended themselves
ended themselves

drawn formerly rights ended themselves
formerly along time they were on

abjure them with determining 
I stay the right of my possessions 

I can’t remember them
in the long time they were on

phrase them of our possessions
phrase them

before I act on them
So I presume the offers already
