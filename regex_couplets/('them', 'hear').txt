('them', 'hear')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
You can hear it also through your leisure

In a continuous theme
I hear it between bills and stuff

or argued for them at least
I can hear it between bills and stuff

talking into pheasants bending themselves
that I can hear

I can hear them between bills and stuff
that I hear without trying

but I can hear them
as far back as my history heard

the opacity given to them
In my heart did I lose trust

I speak them of my possessions
