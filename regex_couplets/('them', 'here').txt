('them', 'here')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Of course there is a direction

That’s exaclty what I want for them
One day there is direction

I can’t fix them without direction
there are quarters 

We can wrestle them with their goals
We can rest there in them with their goals

In a continuous theme
I’ll get there eventually

or argued for them at least
There was very little physical activity

I had to tell them the news
there was no promotion

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Where I take my liesure

I can hear them between bills and stuff
there was no television to hear

the opacity given to them
but where is it

Then I saw them interview
I get through there

I have them lost
I get from here through there

I designed them to hold up my underwear
where I need gravity

I speak to them
where I send and relive

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I send and retrieve relive

I speak to them my possessions
if there is anything 

I speak them of my possessions
Where in me did I host

pre-worn and still wash them
Where in me pre-worn

so still them
after though there’s no memory

 them
Where in me did I loose

so still watch them
Where in me did I lose trust

speak them of my possessions
Is there a baby and a bear

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
where rights ended themselves

where lights blended themselves
By my memory elsewhere

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in memory elsewhere

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
my ethereal economic relations

abjure them with determining 
I learned the point where I am

I have them trust in me
where the tongue rippled

phrase them of our possessions
The prospects there already

phrase them of my possessions
The offers there already

before I act on them
