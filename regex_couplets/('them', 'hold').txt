('them', 'hold')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I take hold of my finger

In a continuous theme
When they really take hold of my finger

or argued for them at least
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

I had to tell them the news
and hold and wish to hold

I have them lost
designed to hold up my underwear

I designed them to hold up my underwear
that hold and wish to hold

Then I saw them interview
