('them', 'home')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
promoting from home to a new job

talking into pheasants bending themselves
that agreed home

I canâ€™t remember them
and came home to rewind inflections

before I act on them
at home brought into privacy

phrase them of our possessions
home stays brought loyal

phrase them of my possessions
So I find myself at home
