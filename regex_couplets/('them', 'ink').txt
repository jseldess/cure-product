('them', 'ink')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
ink

In a continuous theme
all that I can think I want

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I only think I don’t listen

before I act on them
