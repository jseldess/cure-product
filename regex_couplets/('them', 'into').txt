('them', 'into')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
into the stream of pictures

I can’t fix them without direction
into rotating and directionless space

We can wrestle them with their goals
and then into rotating and directional space

In a continuous theme
into the well controlled climate

or argued for them at least
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

but I can hear them
Then I saw into you

Then I saw them interview
talking into percents bending themselves

walking into percents blending themselves
walking into percents

I have them lost
entered into my purposes

I speak to them
deep into pathways from repeated travels

I speak to them my possessions
stopping into the prospect

pre-worn and still wash them
step by into the prospect

I speak them of my possessions
converting sight into a purchase

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
into liminal reflexing

I have them trust in me
at home brought into privacy

phrase them of our possessions
already brought into privacy

before I act on them
stepping off into the middle
