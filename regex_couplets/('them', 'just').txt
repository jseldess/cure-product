('them', 'just')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

That’s exaclty what I want for them
They’re just not mine

I can’t fix them without direction
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

In a continuous theme
I just got a letter

or argued for them at least
it was not just a defeat

the opacity given to them
was not just a defeat

Then I saw them interview
