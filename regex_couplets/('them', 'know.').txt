('them', 'know.')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
how can I know without direction

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
Though how can you know without direction

In a continuous theme
I even know what I would find

talking into pheasants bending themselves
even when close to my knowing

I designed them to hold up my underwear
knowing the constituents

I speak to them my possessions
who knows the way

so still them
who knows how to turn it off

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
that their knowing

I have them lost
