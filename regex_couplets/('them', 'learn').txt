('them', 'learn')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
in light of learning what we see

That’s exaclty what I want for them
I spend time online learning to code

In a continuous theme
learned without too much difficulty to code

or argued for them at least
decisioned to learn 

speak them of my possessions
decisioned to learn back

phrase them of my possessions
phase decision for learning

I speak them of my possessions
my daughter will learn 

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
for learning by the prospect

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
I learned my location

I have them lost
I learned my point

I have them trust in me
a precision for learning

before I act on them
