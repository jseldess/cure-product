('them', 'learning')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
in light of learning what we see

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
I spend time online learning to code

In a continuous theme
Then I am learning to code

or argued for them at least
phase decision for learning

I speak them of my possessions
for learning by the prospect

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
a precision for learning

before I act on them
