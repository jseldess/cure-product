('them', 'line')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
on the time line I was on

In a continuous theme
On the timeline I was on

or argued for them at least
The days lined along company

I had to tell them the news
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

I speak to them
Choose a line

phrase them of our possessions
