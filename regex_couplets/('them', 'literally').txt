('them', 'literally')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
and literally moved

Then I saw them interview
as it was designed literally

I speak to them
and literally unproved

I speak to them my possessions
and move them literally with me

I literally move them
literally move

I speak them of my possessions
and literally moved about

pre-worn and still wash them
not literally moved about

so still them
not literally moved

abjure them with determining
