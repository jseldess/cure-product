('them', 'little')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
with little reason to move

or argued for them at least
with little reasons to aspiration

I had to tell them the news
aspirating with little visions

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I swayed a little in my state

I designed them to hold up my underwear
