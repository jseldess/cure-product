('them', 'live')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Which is a measure to never live out

In a continuous theme
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Which is a pleasure to never live out

the opacity given to them
where I send and relive aside

I speak to them
where I send and relive

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I send and retrieve relive

I speak to them my possessions
where I stand and relive

battery dawn nights ending themselves
