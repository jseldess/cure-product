('them', 'log')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I logged in

In a continuous theme
I log in and search with my head

or argued for them at least
I used my technology

I designed them to hold up my underwear
and other types of tracking technology

Then I saw them interview
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

I speak to them
