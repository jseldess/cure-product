('them', 'man')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

In a continuous theme
not many face up

talking into pheasants bending themselves
though not many facts up in the sky

I can hear them between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

the opacity given to them
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

Then I saw them interview
They have very many choices

I speak to them
and that man comes on to tell me 

pre-worn and still wash them
The many transparent pixel calls

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
