('them', 'many')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
not many face up

talking into pheasants bending themselves
though not many facts up in the sky

I can hear them between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

the opacity given to them
They have very many choices

I speak to them
The many transparent pixel calls

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
