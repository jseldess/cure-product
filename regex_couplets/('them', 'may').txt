('them', 'may')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
may not be ingrained

talking into pheasants bending themselves
may not be engrained

I can hear them between bills and stuff
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

pre-worn and still wash them
and maybe regrettable 

before I act on them
and maybe forgettable
