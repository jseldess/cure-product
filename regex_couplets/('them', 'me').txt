('them', 'me')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Then fall then summer from my face

That’s exaclty what I want for them
only fragments of time with my children

I can’t fix them without direction
Then fall then summer

In a continuous theme
and the graph ahead of me

or argued for them at least
since I can imagine movement

I had to tell them the news
I had me a vision

talking into pheasants bending themselves
The long time I had a vision

I can hear them between bills and stuff
will not be the same

but I can hear them
I resume unassimilable visions

the opacity given to them
The long time I was a vision

talking into percents bending themselves
without the long time I was accounting

walking into percents blending themselves
If I take a different measure

I have them lost
I have them trust in me

I designed them to hold up my underwear
And for an ungraspable time

Then I saw them interview
But my not feeling the memory aside

I speak to them
But my not feeling the memory inside

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
firing and connecting somewhere

I speak to them my possessions
and move them literally with me

I literally move them
without their agreement

I speak them of my possessions
I presume to others

speak them of my possessions
Where in me did I host

pre-worn and still wash them
Where in me pre-worn

so still them
after though there’s no memory

 them
Where in me did I loose

so still watch them
Where in me did I lose trust

phrase them of my possessions
A way formerly like this one

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
drawn formerly a long time

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in memory elsewhere

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

dawn formerly rights blended themselves
drawn formerly rights blended themselves

dawn formerly nights ended themselves
drawn formerly rights

ended themselves
drawn formerly rights ended themselves

where rights ended themselves
drawn formerly along 

abjure them with determining 
which I feel formerly about for

I can’t remember them
in the long time they were on

phrase them of our possessions
that agreed home

phrase them
I assume the offers reliable

before I act on them
So I presume the offers already
