('them', 'move')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
since I can imagine movement

or argued for them at least
with little reasons to move

I had to tell them the news
with little reason to move

talking into pheasants bending themselves
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

I designed them to hold up my underwear
and literally moved

Then I saw them interview
myself moved literally as it is

I speak to them my possessions
and move them literally with me

I literally move them
literally move

I speak them of my possessions
and literally moved about

pre-worn and still wash them
not literally moved about

so still them
also didnâ€™t really move

battery dawn nights ending themselves
not literally moved

abjure them with determining
