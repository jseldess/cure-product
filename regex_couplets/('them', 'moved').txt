('them', 'moved')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
and literally moved

Then I saw them interview
myself moved literally as it is

I speak to them my possessions
and literally moved about

I speak them of my possessions
I literally moved

pre-worn and still wash them
not literally moved about

so still them
not literally moved

abjure them with determining
