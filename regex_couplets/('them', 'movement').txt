('them', 'movement')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
since I can imagine movement

or argued for them at least
with full potential to movement

I had to tell them the news
since you can imagine movement

talking into pheasants bending themselves
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

I designed them to hold up my underwear
