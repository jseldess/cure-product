('them', 'myself')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

In a continuous theme
I keep turning back again myself

or argued for them at least
off the end myself

I had to tell them the news
myself

I speak to them my possessions
the least productive of myself

battery dawn nights ending themselves
So I find myself at home

phrase them of our possessions
So I found myself at home

before I act on them
