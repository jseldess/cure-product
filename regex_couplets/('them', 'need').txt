('them', 'need')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

That’s exaclty what I want for them
and can’t presume to need

In a continuous theme
I need the work

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I need an explicit statement

I can hear them between bills and stuff
which I needed for an explicit state

the opacity given to them
You need history

talking into percents bending themselves
And need out in front purchase

I designed them to hold up my underwear
where I need gravity

Then I saw them interview
not needing to wait

I speak to them my possessions
without really needing

I speak them of my possessions
in need one in that best own

speak them of my possessions
need one in best own

phrase them of my possessions
that in need one best own

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
