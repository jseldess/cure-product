('them', 'night')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

In a continuous theme
blue and sun again a second, then night

or argued for them at least
I had nightmares though

I had to tell them the news
dawn already formerly nights 

Then I saw them interview
last night

I speak to them my possessions
with dawn already formerly nights 

I speak them of my possessions
battery dawn nights 

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
battery dawn nights ending themselves

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

dawn formerly rights blended themselves
dawn formerly nights ended themselves

drawn formerly rights blended themselves
