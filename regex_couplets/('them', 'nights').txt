('them', 'nights')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
dawn already formerly nights 

Then I saw them interview
with dawn already formerly nights 

I speak to them my possessions
battery dawn nights 

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
battery dawn nights ending themselves

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

dawn formerly rights blended themselves
dawn formerly nights ended themselves

drawn formerly rights blended themselves
