('them', 'no')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
and not falling at all

That’s exaclty what I want for them
if not directly on my skin

I can’t fix them without direction
Though how can you know without direction

In a continuous theme
Then I cannot see face value

or argued for them at least
there was no promotion

I had to tell them the news
I take it out in the snow fall

talking into pheasants bending themselves
may not be ingrained

I can hear them between bills and stuff
may not be engrained

but I can hear them
until I could not tire 

the opacity given to them
until I could not be tired

talking into percents bending themselves
even when close to my knowing

I designed them to hold up my underwear
that nothing had gravity

Then I saw them interview
which we can pronounce

I speak to them
But my not feeling the memory inside

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
But my not feeling the memory aside

I speak to them my possessions
and it’s not literal

pre-worn and still wash them
who knows the way

so still them
after though there’s no memory

 them
It’s not marshal exactly

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
not literally moved about

battery dawn nights ending themselves
between cereal and economic

abjure them with determining 
I returned not sad exactly

I have them lost
that their knowing

I have them trust in me
in that I cannot remember 

before I act on them
which is not necessarily possible

phrase them of our possessions
for a while not to listen
