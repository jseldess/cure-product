('them', 'nor')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
into the minority proportion of time

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
over the long line I would honor

In a continuous theme
the simple act of honoring an accountant

talking into pheasants bending themselves
nor work in this way daily

Then I saw them interview
which had on honor to be told

I speak to them my possessions
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
