('them', 'now')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
on a snow day with my children

That’s exaclty what I want for them
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

I can’t fix them without direction
Though how can you know without direction

In a continuous theme
Right now I’m the cart

or argued for them at least
I take it out in the snow fall

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I even know what I would find

I can hear them between bills and stuff
even when close to my knowing

I designed them to hold up my underwear
knowing the constituents

I speak to them my possessions
who knows the way

so still them
who knows how to turn it off

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
that their knowing

I have them lost
