('them', 'offer')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
in the form filled offered in trust

Then I saw them interview
in the form filled offered trust

pre-worn and still wash them
in the form filled offered must

so still watch them
in the form filled offered

I speak them of my possessions
in track as offer asked 

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
I assume the offers reliable

before I act on them
So I presume the offers already

phrase them of our possessions
I presume the offers
