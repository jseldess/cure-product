('them', 'only')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
only fragments of time with my children

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
only in the case

In a continuous theme
So that I notice I am the only one

or argued for them at least
would only willingly break

I speak to them my possessions
if only on the way to the trash

before I act on them
