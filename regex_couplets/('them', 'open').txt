('them', 'open')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Before we walk across the wide opening

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
my desires were open

In a continuous theme
I wish my desires were open

or argued for them at least
The simple act opening surmounted

talking into pheasants bending themselves
