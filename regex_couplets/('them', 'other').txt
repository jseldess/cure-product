('them', 'other')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
others desires

In a continuous theme
I’ll pull myself another personality type

or argued for them at least
On the other hand

talking into pheasants bending themselves
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

I designed them to hold up my underwear
and other types of tracking technology

Then I saw them interview
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

I speak to them
I presume to others

speak them of my possessions
to the other end

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
Cereal and others’ health

abjure them with determining 
I assume possession to others
