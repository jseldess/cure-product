('them', 'our')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
conversations with our purchase

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
You can hear it also through your leisure

In a continuous theme
or an available resource

or argued for them at least
reasons resources

the opacity given to them
or alter of course the time anyway

Then I saw them interview
This is your chance

I speak to them
Who throws contours away

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
phrase them of our possessions

phrase them
own best form to ourselves

phrase them of my possessions
