('them', 'over')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I step over the edge

In a continuous theme
hovering above standing water

or argued for them at least
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

the opacity given to them
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

I designed them to hold up my underwear
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

I speak to them
for not paying sound overwhelmed

I speak to them my possessions
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
