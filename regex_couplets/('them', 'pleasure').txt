('them', 'pleasure')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Which is a pleasure to never live out

In a continuous theme
there was no walking along the pleasure

talking into pheasants bending themselves
up in the television pleasure

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

but I can hear them
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

the opacity given to them
