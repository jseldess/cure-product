('them', 'possession')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I speak to them my possessions

and move them literally with me
my possessions

I speak them of my possessions
speech my possession of my children

speak them of my possessions
my possession of my children

phrase them of my possessions
I stay the right of my possessions 

I have them lost
possessions people

I have them trust in me
phrase them of our possessions

phrase them
possessions

I canâ€™t remember them
Or can have seen offering possession
