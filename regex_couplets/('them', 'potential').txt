('them', 'potential')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
I am full of potential

or argued for them at least
with full potential to movement

I had to tell them the news
full of potential

talking into pheasants bending themselves
