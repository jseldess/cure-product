('them', 'presume')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
and canâ€™t presume to need

In a continuous theme
I continue to presume

I designed them to hold up my underwear
I presume to others

speak them of my possessions
So I presume the offers already

phrase them of our possessions
I presume the offers

before I act on them
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
