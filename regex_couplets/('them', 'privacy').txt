('them', 'privacy')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
by in the sound privacy

phrase them of my possessions
by in the sounded privacy

I speak them of my possessions
buy in the surrounded privacy

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
bought in the sounded privacy

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
buy in the sound privacy

phrase them of our possessions
at home brought into privacy

speak them of my possessions
bought in the surrounded privacy 

before I act on them
