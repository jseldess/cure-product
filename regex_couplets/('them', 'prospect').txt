('them', 'prospect')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
the impulse for my own prospects

I speak to them
the impulse my own prospects

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
stopping into the prospect

pre-worn and still wash them
speech that is of by prospects

phrase them of my possessions
decisioned by the prospect

I speak them of my possessions
step in by the prospect

battery dawn nights ending themselves
The prospects there already

phrase them of our possessions
phase decisioned by the prospect

before I act on them
