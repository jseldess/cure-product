('them', 'prospects')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
the impulse for my own prospects

I speak to them
the impulse my own prospects

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
speech that is of by prospects

phrase them of my possessions
The prospects there already

phrase them of our possessions
the prospects being seen by me

before I act on them
