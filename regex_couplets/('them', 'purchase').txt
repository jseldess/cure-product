('them', 'purchase')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
conversations with our purchase

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
in traversing my purchase

talking into pheasants bending themselves
purchased out

I designed them to hold up my underwear
until I purchase up the sky

Then I saw them interview
the impulse for my own purchases

I speak to them
for my own purchases

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
converting sight into a purchase

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
impulse for my own purchases

battery dawn nights ending themselves
at the site of a purchase

I have them lost
