('them', 'purchases')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I designed them to hold up my underwear
Is the weight of my purchases

Then I saw them interview
the impulse for my own purchases

I speak to them
for my own purchases

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
impulse for my own purchases

battery dawn nights ending themselves
