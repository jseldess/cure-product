('them', 'purpose')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
by no ventillation my purpose

In a continuous theme
until my purpose up in the sky

or argued for them at least
until I purpose the horizon

talking into percents bending themselves
of my purpose in versing

I have them lost
in conversing of my purpose

I designed them to hold up my underwear
I tell you my purposes

Then I saw them interview
the impulse for my own purposes

I speak to them
the impulse to my purpose

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
to the other end of my purpose

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
aside the impulse to my purpose

battery dawn nights ending themselves
for my own purposes

abjure them with determining
