('them', 'really')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

That’s exaclty what I want for them
When they really take hold of my finger

In a continuous theme
That’s when they really take

or argued for them at least
without really agreeing

Then I saw them interview
without really speaking

I speak to them
without really branding 

I speak to them my possessions
without really needing

I speak them of my possessions
also didn’t really move

battery dawn nights ending themselves
