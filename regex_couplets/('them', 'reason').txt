('them', 'reason')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
reasons resources

In a continuous theme
with little reason to move

or argued for them at least
with little reasons to aspiration

I had to tell them the news
with little reason to aspiration

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Toward the start informally given my reasons

the opacity given to them
More reasons 

Then I saw them interview
More reasons around my country 

I speak to them
and could be inflected with reasons

before I act on them
