('them', 'reasons')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
reasons resources

In a continuous theme
with little reasons to aspiration

or argued for them at least
with little reasons to move

I had to tell them the news
Toward the start informally given my reasons

the opacity given to them
More reasons 

Then I saw them interview
More reasons around my country 

I speak to them
and could be inflected with reasons

before I act on them
