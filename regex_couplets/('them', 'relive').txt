('them', 'relive')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
where I send and relive aside

I speak to them
where I send and relive

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I send and retrieve relive

I speak to them my possessions
where I stand and relive

battery dawn nights ending themselves
