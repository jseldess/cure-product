('them', 'rest')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
wrestling to stay still

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
We can wrestle them with their goals

We can rest there in them with their goals
that agreed one of rest

speak them of my possessions
Aligned or not with my interests

battery dawn nights ending themselves
 as points which are my interest 

abjure them with determining 
home rest form to ourselves 

phrase them of our possessions
