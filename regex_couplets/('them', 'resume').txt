('them', 'resume')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
and canâ€™t presume to need

In a continuous theme
I resume unassimilable visions

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I resume indelible tracks

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

but I can hear them
I resume attributable visions

the opacity given to them
I continue to presume

I designed them to hold up my underwear
I presume to others

speak them of my possessions
So I presume the offers already

phrase them of our possessions
I presume the offers

before I act on them
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
