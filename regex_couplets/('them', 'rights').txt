('them', 'rights')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

I speak to them my possessions
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

where rights ended themselves
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

dawn formerly nights lended themselves
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

drawn formerly rights blended themselves
drawn formerly rights

ended themselves
drawn formerly rights ended themselves

where lights blended themselves
