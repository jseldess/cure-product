('them', 'ring')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
interferring 

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
bring your child along

In a continuous theme
hovering above standing water

or argued for them at least
actually considering the end

talking into pheasants bending themselves
the simple act of honoring an accountant

the opacity given to them
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

talking into percents bending themselves
wearing trying talking into it

walking into percents blending themselves
storing in surfeit

I designed them to hold up my underwear
firing and connecting somewhere

I speak to them my possessions
The prospect for veering healthily

before I act on them
Or can have seen offering possession
