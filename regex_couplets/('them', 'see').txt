('them', 'see')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Then I cannot see face value

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
If I let myself see others desires

In a continuous theme
where I can claim to see the ruins

or argued for them at least
under the last seen principle

I designed them to hold up my underwear
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

Then I saw them interview
Having seen more than 

I speak them of my possessions
being seen by me

before I act on them
Having seen more than I can remember
