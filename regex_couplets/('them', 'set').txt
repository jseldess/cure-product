('them', 'set')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
upset by Gingrich

In a continuous theme
in front of the set afternoon

or argued for them at least
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

Then I saw them interview
presets

phrase them
preset

I canâ€™t remember them
reset

before I act on them
