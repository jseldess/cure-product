('them', 'side')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I’m simply inside

I can’t fix them without direction
aside from the retinas

or argued for them at least
actually considering the end

talking into pheasants bending themselves
But my not feeling the memory aside

I speak to them
But my not feeling the memory inside

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I am aside

I speak to them my possessions
by the side of the hosting service

pre-worn and still wash them
By my feeling the memory inside

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
where I send and relive aside

battery dawn nights ending themselves
