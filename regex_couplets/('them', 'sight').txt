('them', 'sight')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In my sight 

I had to tell them the news
in pursuit of the sight

I designed them to hold up my underwear
converting sight

speak them of my possessions
my sight hosting

pre-worn and still wash them
converting sight into a purchase

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
