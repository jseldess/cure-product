('them', 'site')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
here is the site of the battle of maldon

I designed them to hold up my underwear
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

I speak to them
about the site

pre-worn and still wash them
at the site of a purchase

I have them lost
