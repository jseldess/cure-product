('them', 'skin')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
skin smile repeated expressions

That’s exaclty what I want for them
if not directly on my skin

I can’t fix them without direction
sizes track for asking sound

I speak them of my possessions
sizes asking for tracking sound

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
