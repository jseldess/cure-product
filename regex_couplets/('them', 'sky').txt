('them', 'sky')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
over the long time up in the sky

In a continuous theme
over the long line up in the sky

or argued for them at least
though not many facts up in the sky

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

I can hear them between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

the opacity given to them
Up in the sky

I designed them to hold up my underwear
until I purchase up the sky

Then I saw them interview
