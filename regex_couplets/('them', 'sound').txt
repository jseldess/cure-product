('them', 'sound')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
sound inundated for my own purchases

I speak to them
for not paying sound overwhelmed

I speak to them my possessions
by in the sound privacy

phrase them of my possessions
by in the sounded privacy

I speak them of my possessions
sizes track for asking sound

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
sizes asking for tracking sound

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
buy in the sound privacy

phrase them of our possessions
bought in the sounded privacy

before I act on them
