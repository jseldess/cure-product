('them', 'space')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
in rotating directionless space

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
into rotating and directionless space

We can wrestle them with their goals
and then into rotating and directional space

In a continuous theme
in the space that it had

Then I saw them interview
though we are breaking in the space that it had

I speak to them
in the fill space 

I have them lost
