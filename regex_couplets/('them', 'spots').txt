('them', 'spots')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
white spots on a black surface

talking into pheasants bending themselves
but they are black spots

I can hear them between bills and stuff
black spots on a white surface

but I can hear them
simple black spots

the opacity given to them
all the spots

Then I saw them interview
