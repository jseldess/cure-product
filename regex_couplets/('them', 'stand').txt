('them', 'stand')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
hovering above standing water

or argued for them at least
I stand and retrieve the impulse

I speak to them
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I stand and retrieve and relive

I speak to them my possessions
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
where I stand and relive

battery dawn nights ending themselves
my standing in data

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
I learned the point of standing

I have them lost
