('them', 'state')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
explicit statements

talking into pheasants bending themselves
wrapped in static and explicit statements

I can hear them between bills and stuff
wrapped in static implicit statements

but I can hear them
I need an explicit statement

the opacity given to them
for an explicit state

talking into percents bending themselves
like state mirror

walking into percents blending themselves
I swayed a little in my state

I designed them to hold up my underwear
in my state

I have them lost
state kept owned impression

phrase them of our possessions
