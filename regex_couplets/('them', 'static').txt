('them', 'static')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
wrapped in static and explicit statements

I can hear them between bills and stuff
wrapped in static implicit statements

but I can hear them
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

talking into pheasants bending themselves
You can hear it also through static leisure

the opacity given to them
while wrapped in explicit static

talking into percents bending themselves
