('them', 'stay')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
wrestling to stay still

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
So stay with us

I had to tell them the news
own stays brought loyal

speak them of my possessions
own that stays brought loyal

phrase them of my possessions
that stays brought loyal

I speak them of my possessions
I stay the right of my elections

abjure them with determining 
I stay the right of my possessions 

I have them lost
home stays brought loyal

phrase them of our possessions
