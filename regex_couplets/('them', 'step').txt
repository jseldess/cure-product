('them', 'step')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I step off the edge

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
I step over the edge

In a continuous theme
What the next step

or argued for them at least
from which to step off

I had to tell them the news
step in by the prospect

I speak them of my possessions
phase decision step in

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
step by into the prospect

before I act on them
stepping in the middle
