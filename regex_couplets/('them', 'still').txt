('them', 'still')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
That is itself not still

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
I love my daughter still

talking into pheasants bending themselves
though we are still breaking in

I speak to them
still wash conserving

pre-worn and still wash them
so still watch them

so still them
so still washed

 them
my in-laws still wash conserving

I speak them of my possessions
