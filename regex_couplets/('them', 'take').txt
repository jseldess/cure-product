('them', 'take')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I take hold of my finger

In a continuous theme
When they really take hold of my finger

or argued for them at least
If I take a different measure

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Where I take my liesure

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I take it out in the snow fall

but I can hear them
If I take some different measure

the opacity given to them
to take the call

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
and it doesnâ€™t take long

I speak to them my possessions
