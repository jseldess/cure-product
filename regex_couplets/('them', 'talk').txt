('them', 'talk')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

or argued for them at least
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I can hear them between bills and stuff
talking into percents bending themselves

walking into percents blending themselves
talking into the cents

I have them lost
