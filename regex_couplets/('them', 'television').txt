('them', 'television')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
there wasnâ€™t any television 

talking into pheasants bending themselves
up in the television pleasure

I can hear them between bills and stuff
up in the television

but I can hear them
there was no television to hear

the opacity given to them
joined in my television

battery dawn nights ending themselves
