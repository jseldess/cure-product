('them', 'tell')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Then I constellate my time family country

In a continuous theme
I had to tell them the news

talking into pheasants bending themselves
So I constellate the time family country

the opacity given to them
I tell you my purposes

I designed them to hold up my underwear
I tell you the weight of my purchases

Then I saw them interview
and that man comes on to tell me 

pre-worn and still wash them
