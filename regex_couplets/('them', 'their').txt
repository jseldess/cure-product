('them', 'their')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
We can wrestle them with their goals

We can rest there in them with their goals
I am not allowed to see their face

or argued for them at least
without their agreement

I speak to them my possessions
to their other end

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
that their knowing

I have them lost
