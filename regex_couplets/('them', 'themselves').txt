('them', 'themselves')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I can hear them between bills and stuff
talking into percents bending themselves

walking into percents blending themselves
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

I speak to them my possessions
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

where rights ended themselves
where lights blended themselves

I speak them of my possessions
battery dawn nights ending themselves

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

dawn formerly rights blended themselves
drawn formerly rights blended themselves

dawn formerly nights ended themselves
ended themselves

drawn formerly rights ended themselves
