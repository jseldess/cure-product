('them', 'They')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
They’re just not mine

I can’t fix them without direction
They are called aspirational

or argued for them at least
They can be waived

Then I saw them interview
They have very many choices

I speak to them
They were filters

battery dawn nights ending themselves
