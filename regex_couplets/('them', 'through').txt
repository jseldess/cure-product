('them', 'through')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
You can hear it also through your leisure

In a continuous theme
Back up through the results

or argued for them at least
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I cannot clear it also through investiture

but I can hear them
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

talking into pheasants bending themselves
You can hear it also through static leisure

the opacity given to them
I get through there

I have them lost
I get from here through there

I designed them to hold up my underwear
