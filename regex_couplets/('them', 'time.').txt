('them', 'time.')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
only fragments of time with my children

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
where I sleep at times

In a continuous theme
On the timeline I was on

or argued for them at least
The long time I had a vision

talking into pheasants bending themselves
without the long time I was accounting

I can hear them between bills and stuff
So I constellate the time family country

the opacity given to them
The long time I was a vision

talking into percents bending themselves
which is the long time I was on

walking into percents blending themselves
the long time I was on

I have them lost
in the long time they were on

I designed them to hold up my underwear
or alter of course the time anyway

Then I saw them interview
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

I speak to them
until a happier time found

I speak to them my possessions
formerly a long time they were on

I speak them of my possessions
formerly along time they were on

speak them of my possessions
time they were on

phrase them of my possessions
formerly along the time they were on

abjure them with determining
