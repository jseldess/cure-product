('them', 'tire')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

or argued for them at least
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

I had to tell them the news
until I could not tire 

I can hear them between bills and stuff
until I could not be tired

talking into pheasants bending themselves
for to tire as far back as my history

talking into percents bending themselves
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

Then I saw them interview
