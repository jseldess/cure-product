('them', 'track')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I reuse indelible tracks 

talking into pheasants bending themselves
The first track

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I refuse indelible tracks

but I can hear them
in not many tracks up in the sky

the opacity given to them
and other types of tracking technology

Then I saw them interview
trackers collecting data on users

I speak to them
which as tracked befitted 

pre-worn and still wash them
which as tracked befitted phased

I speak them of my possessions
sizes track for asking sound

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
sizes asking for tracking sound

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
between tracked and buffered

before I act on them
