('them', 'tracks')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I reuse indelible tracks 

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I refuse indelible tracks

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I resume indelible tracks

but I can hear them
in not many tracks up in the sky

the opacity given to them
