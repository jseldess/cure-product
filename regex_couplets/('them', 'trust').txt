('them', 'trust')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I have them trust in me

I designed them to hold up my underwear
in the form filled offered in trust

Then I saw them interview
about the sight hosting trusting

pre-worn and still wash them
in the form filled offered trust

so still them
Where in me did I lose trust

I speak them of my possessions
