('them', 'trying')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
when trying to feel the extension of key values

or argued for them at least
that I hear without trying

talking into pheasants bending themselves
wearing trying talking into it

talking into percents bending themselves
I spun around trying to touch the spots

Then I saw them interview
