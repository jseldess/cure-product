('them', 'turn')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In a sharp downard turn

That’s exaclty what I want for them
in a sharp downward turn 

In a continuous theme
I keep turning back

or argued for them at least
who knows how to turn it off

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
I turn not sad exactly

battery dawn nights ending themselves
I return not sad exactly

abjure them with determining 
I returned not sad exactly

I have them lost
I returned

I can’t remember them
