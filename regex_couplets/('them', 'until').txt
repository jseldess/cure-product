('them', 'until')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
until my purpose up in the sky

In a continuous theme
until I could not tire 

I can hear them between bills and stuff
until I could not be tired

talking into pheasants bending themselves
until I could not be hired

talking into percents bending themselves
until I purpose up in the sky

I designed them to hold up my underwear
until I purchase up the sky

Then I saw them interview
until a happier time found

I speak to them my possessions
