('them', 'up?')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In a sharp downard turn

That’s exaclty what I want for them
The sun isn’t up 

I can’t fix them without direction
there are quarters 

We can wrestle them with their goals
Though how can you know without direction

In a continuous theme
I put my bread down

or argued for them at least
I am full of potential

I had to tell them the news
but it continued rippling muscle

talking into pheasants bending themselves
without the long time I was accounting

I can hear them between bills and stuff
black spots on a white surface

but I can hear them
I resume unassimilable visions

the opacity given to them
around my country 

Then I saw them interview
If you have confidence regardless all else

talking into percents bending themselves
I resume attributable visions

walking into percents blending themselves
If I take a different measure

I have them lost
I have them trust in me

I designed them to hold up my underwear
I have supporters

I speak to them
But my not feeling the memory inside

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
But my not feeling the memory aside

I speak to them my possessions
without their agreement

I speak them of my possessions
I presume to others

speak them of my possessions
in the form filled offered in trust

pre-worn and still wash them
still carefully

so still them
after though there’s no memory

 them
in the form filled offered must

so still watch them
Where in me did I lose trust

phrase them of my possessions
by in the sounded privacy

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
I assumed what I draw

battery dawn nights ending themselves
radiating from housing

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
I thought

where rights ended themselves
about 

abjure them with determining 
I returned not sad exactly

I can’t remember them
sung reflexing

phrase them of our possessions
decisions that can be attributable

phrase them
between bills and stuffed animals

before I act on them
So I presume the offers already
