('them', 'us')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

That’s exaclty what I want for them
They’re just not mine

I can’t fix them without direction
slow asynchronous

In a continuous theme
in a continuous vertiginous dream

or argued for them at least
So stay with us

I had to tell them the news
but it continued rippling muscle

talking into pheasants bending themselves
because there was no solid ground to continue along

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I reuse indelible tracks 

but I can hear them
I want to cite a poem so usual

the opacity given to them
I have them trust in me

I designed them to hold up my underwear
I wear suspenders

Then I saw them interview
trackers collecting data on users

I speak to them
useless for not having paid

I speak to them my possessions
in the form filled offered in trust

pre-worn and still wash them
in the form filled offered trust

so still them
in the form filled offered must

so still watch them
Where in me did I lose trust

I speak them of my possessions
radiating from housing

battery dawn nights ending themselves
