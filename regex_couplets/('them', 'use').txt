('them', 'use')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
You use the most essential parts

In a continuous theme
I reuse unassimilable visions

talking into pheasants bending themselves
because there was no solid ground to continue along

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I reuse indelible tracks 

but I can hear them
I used my technology

I designed them to hold up my underwear
trackers collecting data on users

I speak to them
useless for not having paid

I speak to them my possessions
