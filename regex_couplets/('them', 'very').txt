('them', 'very')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

or argued for them at least
There was very little physical activity

I had to tell them the news
embodied everyday

talking into pheasants bending themselves
They have very many choices

I speak to them
