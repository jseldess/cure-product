('them', 'vision')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I had me a vision

or argued for them at least
aspirating with visions

I had to tell them the news
aspirating with little visions

talking into pheasants bending themselves
The long time I had a vision

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I resume unassimilable visions

but I can hear them
there was no television to hear

the opacity given to them
The long time I was a vision

talking into percents bending themselves
I resume attributable visions

walking into percents blending themselves
attributable visions

I designed them to hold up my underwear
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

Then I saw them interview
there wasnâ€™t any television 

pre-worn and still wash them
joined in my television

battery dawn nights ending themselves
visions that can be attainable

before I act on them
revisions that can be attributable
