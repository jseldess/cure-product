('them', 'visions')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
The planning process for visions

or argued for them at least
aspirating with visions

I had to tell them the news
aspirating with little visions

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I resume unassimilable visions

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I resume attributable visions

the opacity given to them
attributable visions

I designed them to hold up my underwear
visions that can be attainable

before I act on them
revisions that can be attributable
