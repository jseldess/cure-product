('them', 'wait')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
There are spots waiting

Then I saw them interview
Though we are waiting for her

I speak to them
not needing to wait

I speak to them my possessions
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
waiting out front or up above 

I have them lost
