('them', 'walk')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Before we walk across the wide opening

That’s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field

I can’t fix them without direction
there was no walking along the pleasure

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I walk up and don’t work anymore

the opacity given to them
walking into percents blending themselves

I have them lost
