('them', 'want')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
When I want something

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
I want but not to impart cynicism

In a continuous theme
all that I can think I want

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I want to cite a poem so usual

the opacity given to them
