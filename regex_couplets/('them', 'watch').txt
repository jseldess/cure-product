('them', 'watch')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
when watching tv

or argued for them at least
in the sense of watching

I have them lost
I watch a movie

I designed them to hold up my underwear
I watch a moving afterimage

Then I saw them interview
When I'm watching my tv 

pre-worn and still wash them
so still watch them

so still them
where Iâ€™m watching my tv

battery dawn nights ending themselves
