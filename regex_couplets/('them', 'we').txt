('them', 'We')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
We can wrestle them with their goals

We can rest there in them with their goals
We had to say goodbye there

I designed them to hold up my underwear
We had inhabited actually

Then I saw them interview
We ask say in that case

phrase them of our possessions
