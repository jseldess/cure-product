('them', 'were')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
When we had jobs that were to earn

In a continuous theme
I wish my desires were open

or argued for them at least
The days were long

I had to tell them the news
The days were long aligned

talking into pheasants bending themselves
they were on

I have them lost
in the long time they were on

I designed them to hold up my underwear
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

Then I saw them interview
answered about 

I speak to them my possessions
formerly a long time they were on

I speak them of my possessions
by the sight of the hosting answered about

pre-worn and still wash them
I answered about

so still them
formerly along time they were on

speak them of my possessions
I answered what I thought

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
time they were on

phrase them of my possessions
I answered while interfaced

battery dawn nights ending themselves
They were filters

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
formerly along the time they were on

abjure them with determining 
that they were visible

before I act on them
that they were divisible
