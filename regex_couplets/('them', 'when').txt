('them', 'When')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
When I want something

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
When we had jobs that were to earn

In a continuous theme
When they really take hold of my finger

or argued for them at least
When closed to my knowing

I designed them to hold up my underwear
When I'm watching my tv 

pre-worn and still wash them
