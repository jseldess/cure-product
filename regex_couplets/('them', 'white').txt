('them', 'white')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
white spots on a black surface

talking into pheasants bending themselves
black spots on a white surface

I can hear them between bills and stuff
a futile joyous white sun

I designed them to hold up my underwear
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

Then I saw them interview
