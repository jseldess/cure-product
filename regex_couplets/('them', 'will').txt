('them', 'will')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
will not be the same

talking into pheasants bending themselves
that will spur me on

I designed them to hold up my underwear
would only willingly break

I speak to them my possessions
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

pre-worn and still wash them
my daughter will learn 

I speak them of my possessions
