('them', 'work')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
nor work in this way daily

In a continuous theme
Having transitioned from leisure to work

or argued for them at least
I need the work

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I walk up and don’t work anymore

the opacity given to them
So I work and don’t look any

Then I saw them interview
nor envy honest work

I speak to them
