('them', 'world')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
off the edge of the world

In a continuous theme
off the end of the world

or argued for them at least
hauling off the end of the world

talking into pheasants bending themselves
falling off the end of the world

I can hear them between bills and stuff
the opinions in my world

I speak to them my possessions
