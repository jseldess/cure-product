('them', 'wrapped')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
wrapped in static and explicit statements

I can hear them between bills and stuff
wrapped in static implicit statements

but I can hear them
wrapped in static

talking into pheasants bending themselves
while wrapped in static

the opacity given to them
while wrapped in explicit static

talking into percents bending themselves
