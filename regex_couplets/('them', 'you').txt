('them', 'You')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
You can hear it also through your leisure

In a continuous theme
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

talking into pheasants bending themselves
You can hear it also through static leisure

the opacity given to them
You need history

talking into percents bending themselves
You can have seen offering
