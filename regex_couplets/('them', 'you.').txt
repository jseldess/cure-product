('them', 'you.')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Though how can you know without direction

In a continuous theme
That you can see only the back of

or argued for them at least
since you can imagine movement

I had to tell them the news
where you can earn more 

talking into pheasants bending themselves
You can hear it also through your leisure

the opacity given to them
If you have confidence regardless all else

talking into percents bending themselves
a futile joyous white sun

I designed them to hold up my underwear
I tell you my purposes

Then I saw them interview
This is your chance

I speak to them
the young ripples inaudibly

I have them lost
