('themselves', 'For')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

talking into pheasants bending themselves
For an ungraspable time

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
Formerly a way like this one

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
