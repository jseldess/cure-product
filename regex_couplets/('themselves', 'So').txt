('themselves', 'so')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
When I want something

talking into pheasants bending themselves
no solid ground to continue along

talking into percents bending themselves
If I take some different measure

walking into percents blending themselves
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
firing and connecting somewhere

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
by in the sound privacy

battery dawn nights ending themselves
buy in the sound privacy
