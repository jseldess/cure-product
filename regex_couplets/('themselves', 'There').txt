('themselves', 'There')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

talking into pheasants bending themselves
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

talking into percents bending themselves
There are spots waiting

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
There are constant ways

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
