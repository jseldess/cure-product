('themselves', 'Thou')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Though there are quarters goals

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

talking into percents bending themselves
Though we are waiting for her

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
Though we are waiting 

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
