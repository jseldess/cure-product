('themselves', 'To')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
To my children Walt Whitman

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Tomorrow

talking into percents bending themselves
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
To the ends of transactions

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
To the right of determined elections
