('themselves', 'act')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light

talking into pheasants bending themselves
actually considering the end

talking into percents bending themselves
we had inhabited actually

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
The ends of my transactions

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
I turn not sad exactly

battery dawn nights ending themselves
I return not sad exactly
