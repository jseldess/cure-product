('themselves', 'along')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
bring your child along

talking into pheasants bending themselves
there was no walking along the pleasure

talking into percents bending themselves
formerly along time they were on

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
drawn formerly along 

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
along cables

battery dawn nights ending themselves
shone formerly along time

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
formerly along my say to the elections
