('themselves', 'any')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

talking into pheasants bending themselves
there wasn’t any television 

talking into percents bending themselves
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
latency which doesn’t mean anything

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
or imagined anyway
