('themselves', 'blend')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
walking into percents blending themselves

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I blend and relive

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
where lights blended themselves

where rights ended themselves
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

drawn formerly rights blended themselves
