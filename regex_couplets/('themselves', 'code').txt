('themselves', 'code')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
as long as I have access to the code

talking into pheasants bending themselves
falling off the encoded end

talking into percents bending themselves
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
zipcode

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
