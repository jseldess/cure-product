('themselves', 'count')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Then I constellate my time family country

talking into pheasants bending themselves
without the long time I was accounting

talking into percents bending themselves
without the long time I was on accounting

walking into percents blending themselves
So I constellate the time family country

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
