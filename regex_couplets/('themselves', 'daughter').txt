('themselves', 'daughter')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I love my daughter still

talking into pheasants bending themselves
with my daughter

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
my daughter will learn 

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me

battery dawn nights ending themselves
