('themselves', 'do')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In a sharp downard turn

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Undoubtedly 

talking into percents bending themselves
What I do in my liesure

walking into percents blending themselves
here is the site of the battle of maldon

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
and it doesn’t take long

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
I only think I don’t listen
