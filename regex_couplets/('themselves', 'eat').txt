('themselves', 'eat')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I reach repeated expressions first

talking into pheasants bending themselves
it was not just a defeat

talking into percents bending themselves
And from that great distance

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
burrowed about from repeated travels

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
for the creation of the universe

battery dawn nights ending themselves
