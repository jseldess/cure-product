('themselves', 'else')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
If you have confidence regardless all else

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
elsewhere by my memory

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
By my memory elsewhere

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in memory elsewhere

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
