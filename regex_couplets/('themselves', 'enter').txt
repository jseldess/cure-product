('themselves', 'enter')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
The sun high enough to enter directly 

talking into percents bending themselves
I enter the flattening mirror

walking into percents blending themselves
I have entered my purposes

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
I have entered my phone

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
I had entered my phone

battery dawn nights ending themselves
