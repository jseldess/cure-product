('themselves', 'he')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In the inflected refracted retroactive reactive light

talking into pheasants bending themselves
The long time I had a vision

talking into percents bending themselves
without the long time I was accounting

walking into percents blending themselves
talking into the cents

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
But my not feeling the memory aside

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
where rights ended themselves

where lights blended themselves
time they were on

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in memory elsewhere

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

dawn formerly rights blended themselves
drawn formerly rights blended themselves

dawn formerly nights ended themselves
ended themselves

drawn formerly rights ended themselves
formerly along time they were on
