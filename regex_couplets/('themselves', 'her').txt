('themselves', 'her')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Of course there is a direction

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Where I take my liesure

talking into percents bending themselves
I get through there

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I send and retrieve relive

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
where rights ended themselves

where lights blended themselves
I presume to others

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in memory elsewhere

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
Cereal and othersâ€™ health
