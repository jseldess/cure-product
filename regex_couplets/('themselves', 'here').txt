('themselves', 'here')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Of course there is a direction

talking into pheasants bending themselves
Where I take my liesure

talking into percents bending themselves
I get through there

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I send and retrieve relive

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
where rights ended themselves

where lights blended themselves
By my memory elsewhere

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in memory elsewhere

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
my ethereal economic relations
