('themselves', 'live')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Which is a measure to never live out

talking into pheasants bending themselves
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

talking into percents bending themselves
Which is a pleasure to never live out

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
where I send and retrieve relive

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
where I send and relive

battery dawn nights ending themselves
