('themselves', 'man')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

talking into pheasants bending themselves
not many face up

talking into percents bending themselves
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
and that man comes on to tell me 

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
