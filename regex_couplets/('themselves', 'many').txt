('themselves', 'many')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
not many face up

talking into pheasants bending themselves
though not many facts up in the sky

talking into percents bending themselves
They have very many choices

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
The many transparent pixel calls

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
