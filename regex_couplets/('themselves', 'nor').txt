battery dawn nights blending themselves
into the minority proportion of time

talking into pheasants bending themselves
the simple act of honoring an accountant

talking into percents bending themselves
nor work in this way daily

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
which had on honor to be told

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
