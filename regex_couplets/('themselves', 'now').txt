('themselves', 'now')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
on a snow day with my children

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I take it out in the snow fall

talking into percents bending themselves
even when close to my knowing

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
knowing the constituents

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
who knows the way

battery dawn nights ending themselves
that their knowing
