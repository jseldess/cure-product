('themselves', 'our')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
conversations with our purchase

talking into pheasants bending themselves
You can hear it also through your leisure

talking into percents bending themselves
or alter of course the time anyway

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
Who throws contours away

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
phrase them of our possessions
