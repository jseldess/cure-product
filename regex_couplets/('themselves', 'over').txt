('themselves', 'over')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I step over the edge

talking into pheasants bending themselves
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

talking into percents bending themselves
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
for not paying sound overwhelmed

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
