('themselves', 'purchase')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
conversations with our purchase

talking into pheasants bending themselves
in traversing my purchase

talking into percents bending themselves
purchased out

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
converting sight into a purchase

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
for my own purchases

battery dawn nights ending themselves
at the site of a purchase
