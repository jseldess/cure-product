('themselves', 'repeated')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I reach repeated expressions first

talking into pheasants bending themselves
burrowed about from repeated travels

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
deep into pathways from repeated travels

battery dawn nights ending themselves
