('themselves', 'ring')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
interferring 

talking into pheasants bending themselves
actually considering the end

talking into percents bending themselves
wearing trying talking into it

walking into percents blending themselves
storing in surfeit

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
firing and connecting somewhere

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
The prospect for veering healthily
