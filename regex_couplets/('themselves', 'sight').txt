('themselves', 'sight')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
In my sight 

talking into pheasants bending themselves
in pursuit of the sight

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
converting sight

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
converting sight into a purchase

battery dawn nights ending themselves
