('themselves', 'state')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
explicit statements

talking into pheasants bending themselves
wrapped in static and explicit statements

talking into percents bending themselves
like state mirror

walking into percents blending themselves
I swayed a little in my state

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
in my state
