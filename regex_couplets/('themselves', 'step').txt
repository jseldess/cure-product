('themselves', 'step')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I step off the edge

talking into pheasants bending themselves
from which to step off

talking into percents bending themselves
step in by the prospect

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
phase decision step in

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
step by into the prospect
