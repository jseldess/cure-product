('themselves', 'still')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
That is itself not still

talking into pheasants bending themselves
I love my daughter still

talking into percents bending themselves
though we are still breaking in

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
still wash conserving

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
