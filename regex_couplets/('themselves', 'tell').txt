('themselves', 'tell')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Then I constellate my time family country

talking into pheasants bending themselves
So I constellate the time family country

talking into percents bending themselves
I tell you my purposes

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
and that man comes on to tell me 

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
