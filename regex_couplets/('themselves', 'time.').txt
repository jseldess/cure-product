('themselves', 'time.')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
only fragments of time with my children

talking into pheasants bending themselves
The long time I had a vision

talking into percents bending themselves
without the long time I was accounting

walking into percents blending themselves
the long time I was on

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
until a happier time found

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
time they were on

battery dawn nights ending themselves
in the long time they were on

dawn formerly rights lended themselves
formerly along time they were on
