('themselves', 'trying')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
when trying to feel the extension of key values

talking into pheasants bending themselves
that I hear without trying

talking into percents bending themselves
wearing trying talking into it

walking into percents blending themselves
I spun around trying to touch the spots

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
