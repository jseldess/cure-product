('themselves', 'until')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
until my purpose up in the sky

talking into pheasants bending themselves
until I could not tire 

talking into percents bending themselves
until I purpose up in the sky

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
until a happier time found

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
