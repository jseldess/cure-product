('themselves', 'us')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

talking into pheasants bending themselves
because there was no solid ground to continue along

talking into percents bending themselves
I have them trust in me

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
useless for not having paid

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
radiating from housing

battery dawn nights ending themselves
