('themselves', 'vision')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
I had me a vision

talking into pheasants bending themselves
The long time I had a vision

talking into percents bending themselves
I resume attributable visions

walking into percents blending themselves
attributable visions

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
there wasnâ€™t any television 

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
joined in my television

battery dawn nights ending themselves
visions that can be attainable
