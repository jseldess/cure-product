('themselves', 'will')

battery dawn nights blending themselves
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

talking into pheasants bending themselves
will not be the same

talking into percents bending themselves
that will spur me on

drawn formerly rights ending themselves
would only willingly break

dawn formerly rights ended themselves
my daughter will learn 

battery dawn nights ending themselves
