('then', 'A')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Then fall then summer from my face
All of the time

Then fall then summer
Actually one day there is direction

and then into rotating and directional space
And as an extension of the values

blue and sun again a second, then night
ASPIRATING

then I cannot see face value
Aspirational strategy

then I can see only the back of values
ASPIRATING VISIONS

Then I continue to dream then
COPY DREAM 

Then I continued to dream then
Articles all around us

I continued to dream then
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
