('then', 'And')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
And put in place as though stationary

and then into rotating and directional space
And as an extension of the values

Then fall then summer
And make myself a visible

blue and sun again a second, then night
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Then I continue to dream then
And we had to say goodbye to her there

I continued to dream then
And from a weak distance
