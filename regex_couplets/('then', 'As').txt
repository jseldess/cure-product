('then', 'As')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
As though stationary and a destination

and then into rotating and directional space
Assimilable or

Then fall then summer
Aspirational strategy

then I cannot see face value
As an extension of the values

Then I continue to dream then
As a clone, illegally conceived
