('then', 'if')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
drifting away

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
if not directly on my skin

Then fall then summer
drifting does not feel an exception

blue and sun again a second, then night
That company creates a life

Then I continue to dream then
if there is anything
