('then', 'It')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Then fall then summer from my face
It keeps coming down thankfully

Then fall then summer
It has been since

blue and sun again a second, then night
It’s not marshal exactly
