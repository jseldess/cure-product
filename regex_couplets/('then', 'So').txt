('then', 'so')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Then fall then summer from my face
When I want something

Then fall then summer
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

and then into rotating and directional space
You can hear it also through your leisure

blue and sun again a second, then night
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

Then I continue to dream then
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I continued to dream then
so that nothing had gravity
