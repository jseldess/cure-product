('then', 'That')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
That’s exaclty what I want for them

Then fall then summer
That is itself not still

and then into rotating and directional space
That’s where I sleep at times

blue and sun again a second, then night
That you can see only the back of

then I can see only the back values
That can’t be glimpsed

Then I continue to dream then
That I captured an afterimage

I continued to dream then
That are my right to say
