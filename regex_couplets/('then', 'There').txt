('then', 'There')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Then fall then summer
There are quarterly goals

blue and sun again a second, then night
There was very little physical activity

Then I continue to dream then
There are spots waiting

I continued to dream then
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
