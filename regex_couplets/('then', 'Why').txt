('then', 'Why')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

Then fall then summer from my face
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

blue and sun again a second, then night
