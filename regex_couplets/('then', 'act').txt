('then', 'act')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Then fall then summer from my face
In the retroactive light

Then fall then summer
In the light of retroactive conversations

and then into rotating and directional space
I was enjoined to act again myself

blue and sun again a second, then night
and strategies not tactics

then I cannot see face value
Not goals or tactics

Then I continue to dream then
we had inhabited actually
