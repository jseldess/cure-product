('then', 'again')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
at any time it can drift again

Then fall then summer
I keep turning back again myself

blue and sun again a second, then night
I was enjoined to act again myself

Then I continue to dream then
I let it remind me again

I continued to dream then
