('then', 'any')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Then fall then summer
Before anyone buys up the opening

and then into rotating and directional space
at any time it can drift again

blue and sun again a second, then night
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

Then I continue to dream then
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I continued to dream then
without any further damage
