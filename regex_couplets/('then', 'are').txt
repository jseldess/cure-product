('then', 'are')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Though there are quarters goals

and then into rotating and directional space
who are so fresh and agile

Then fall then summer
barely outlines

blue and sun again a second, then night
They are called aspirational

Then I continue to dream then
There are spots waiting

I continued to dream then
Though we are waiting for her
