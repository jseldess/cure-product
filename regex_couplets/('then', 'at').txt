Then blue and sun again a second, then night

into rotating directionless 

Then fall then summer from my face
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Then fall then summer
I reach repeated expressions first

and then into rotating and directional space

of the habits I create

then I can see only the back of values
What’s the next step

then I can see only the back values
of the habits they create

Then I continue to dream then
I watch a movie

Then I continued to dream then
that I saw

I continued to dream then
And from that great distance
