('then', 'been')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
It has been since

Then fall then summer
After having been contented

blue and sun again a second, then night
that having been after content

Then I continue to dream then
having been an ungraspable time

Then I continued to dream then
having been purchased out

I continued to dream then
