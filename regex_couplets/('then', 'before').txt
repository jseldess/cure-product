('then', 'Before')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Before we walk across the wide field

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Before we walk across the wide opening

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Then fall then summer
Before anyone buys up the opening

and then into rotating and directional space
Before morning goals

blue and sun again a second, then night
