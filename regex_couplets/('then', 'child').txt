('then', 'child')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
On a snow day with my children

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
as pure as my children

Then fall then summer from my face
my children’s consumption

Then fall then summer
especially in a child

and then into rotating and directional space
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

blue and sun again a second, then night
even my child

Then I continue to dream then
my possession of my children
