('then', 'could')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
and could be mapped and weighed

Then fall then summer
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

blue and sun again a second, then night
until I could not tire 

Then I continue to dream then
I could consume the dream

Then I continued to dream then
I could in effect credit

I continued to dream then
and we could inhabit the room easy
