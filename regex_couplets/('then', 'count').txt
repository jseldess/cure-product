('then', 'count')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Then I constellate my time family country

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
So I constellate the time family country

Then fall then summer
I brought my count down

blue and sun again a second, then night
without the long time I was accounting

Then I continue to dream then
More reasons around my country
