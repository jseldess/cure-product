('then', 'day')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
On a snow day with my children

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
One day there is direction

Then fall then summer
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

and then into rotating and directional space
I argued the days felt longer

then I cannot see face value
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

Then I continue to dream then
The day
