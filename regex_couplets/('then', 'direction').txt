('then', 'direction')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
into rotating directionless 

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Of course there is a direction

Then fall then summer
One day there is direction

and then into rotating and directional space
for how can you know without direction

blue and sun again a second, then night
stopping off in all directions
