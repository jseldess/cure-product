('then', 'directly')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
if not directly on my skin

Then fall then summer
of not directly from my skin

and then into rotating and directional space
But not to me directly

blue and sun again a second, then night
The sun high enough to enter directly 

Then I continue to dream then
The sun high enough to strike directly
