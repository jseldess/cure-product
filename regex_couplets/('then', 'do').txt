('then', 'do')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
in a sharp downward turn 

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

Then fall then summer from my face
In a sharp downard turn

Then fall then summer
It keeps coming down thankfully

and then into rotating and directional space
does not feel an exception

blue and sun again a second, then night
What I do in my liesure

Then I continue to dream then
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I continued to dream then
around the dogs and lillies
