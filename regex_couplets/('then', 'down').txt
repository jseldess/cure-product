('then', 'down')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
in a sharp downward turn 

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
In a sharp downard turn

Then fall then summer from my face
It keeps coming down thankfully

Then fall then summer
to the down arrow

blue and sun again a second, then night
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

Then I continue to dream then
