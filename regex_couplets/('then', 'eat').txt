('then', 'eat')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
too sunny to eat ice cream

Then fall then summer from my face
I reach repeated expressions first

Then fall then summer
I propogated repeated expressions first

and then into rotating and directional space
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

blue and sun again a second, then night
of the habits I create

then I cannot see face value
of the habits they create

then I can see only the back values
they create

Then I continue to dream then
And from that great distance

I continued to dream then
And from a great distance
