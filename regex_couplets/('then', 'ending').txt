('then', 'ending')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Then fall then summer from my face
I tried to feel the key values extending 

then I cannot see face value
talking into pheasants bending themselves

Then I continue to dream then
drawn formerly rights ending themselves
