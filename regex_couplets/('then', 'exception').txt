('then', 'exception')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
does not feel an exception

Then fall then summer
drifting does not feel an exception

blue and sun again a second, then night
