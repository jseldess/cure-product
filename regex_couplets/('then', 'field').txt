('then', 'field')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Before we walk across the wide field

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
stopped light with validated variegated fields

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone has walked across the field

Then fall then summer
stopped light with validated fields
