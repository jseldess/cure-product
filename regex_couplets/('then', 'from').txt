('then', 'from')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Then fall then summer from my face

Then fall then summer
Falling from this distance

and then into rotating and directional space
Falling from my face

blue and sun again a second, then night
aside from the retinas

Then I continue to dream then
And from a weak distance

I continued to dream then
And from that great distance
