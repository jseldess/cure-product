('then', 'front')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Then fall then summer
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

blue and sun again a second, then night
in front of the set afternoon

then I cannot see face value
in front of the set of regulations

Then I continue to dream then
And need out in front purchase

I continued to dream then
behind or out front or up above
