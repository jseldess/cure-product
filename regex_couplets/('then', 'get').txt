('then', 'get')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll get there eventually

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
and is relentlessly budgeted

Then fall then summer
I’ll get there ruins

blue and sun again a second, then night
I get through there

Then I continue to dream then
forgetting decisions
