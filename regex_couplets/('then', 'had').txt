('then', 'had')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
If he had not carried one virtue

Then fall then summer
When we had jobs that were to earn

blue and sun again a second, then night
I had me a vision

Then I continue to dream then
we had to say goodbye

I continued to dream then
that nothing had gravity
