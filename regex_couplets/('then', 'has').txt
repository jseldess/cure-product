('then', 'has')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
conversations with our purchase

Then fall then summer
Before anyone has walked across the opening

and then into rotating and directional space
It has been since

blue and sun again a second, then night
in traversing my purchase

Then I continue to dream then
purchased out

I continued to dream then
until I purchase up the sky
