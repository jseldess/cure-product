('then', 'he')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

Then fall then summer from my face
Before we walk across the wide opening

Then fall then summer
The sun isn’t up 

and then into rotating and directional space
If I step over the edge

blue and sun again a second, then night
The planning process for visions

then I cannot see face value
out in the snow

then I can see only the back of values
out in the snow fall

then I can see only the back values
of the habits they create

Then I continue to dream then
I could consume the dream

Then I continued to dream then
Then I continued to dream

I continued to dream then
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
