('then', 'her')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I told her a story, she drew waves.

Then fall then summer from my face
Of course there is a direction

Then fall then summer
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

and then into rotating and directional space
what I find there

blue and sun again a second, then night
there was no promotion

Then I continue to dream then
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

Then I continued to dream then
And we had to say goodbye to her there

I continued to dream then
where I need gravity
