('then', 'here')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll get there eventually

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Of course there is a direction

Then fall then summer
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

and then into rotating and directional space
what I find there

blue and sun again a second, then night
there was no promotion

Then I continue to dream then
And we had to say goodbye to her there

I continued to dream then
where I need gravity
