('then', 'hold')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I take hold of my finger

Then fall then summer
When they really take hold of my finger

blue and sun again a second, then night
Since I had to hold the entire company

Then I continue to dream then
and hold and wish to hold

I continued to dream then
designed to hold up my underwear
