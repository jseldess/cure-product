('then', 'inter')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Then fall then summer from my face
interjecting on a day ambition

Then fall then summer
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

and then into rotating and directional space
way high up in the inter

blue and sun again a second, then night
with internally regulated climate

Then I continue to dream then
Then I saw them interview
