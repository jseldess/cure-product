('then', 'into')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
into rotating directionless 

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
into the stream of pictures

and then into rotating and directional space
into directionless space

Then fall then summer
into a brigand and a murderer

blue and sun again a second, then night
into the well controlled climate

Then I continue to dream then
Then I saw into you
