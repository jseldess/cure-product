Then blue and sun again a second, then night
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

Then fall then summer from my face
The sun isn’t up 

Then fall then summer
The edge isn’t even there

and then into rotating and directional space
Then the sun isn’t available

blue and sun again a second, then night
