('then', 'just')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Then fall then summer
Theyâ€™re just not mine

and then into rotating and directional space
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

blue and sun again a second, then night
it was not just a defeat

Then I continue to dream then
was not just a defeat
