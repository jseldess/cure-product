('then', 'know.')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
who knows the way

Then fall then summer from my face
how can I know without direction

and then into rotating and directional space
for how can you know without direction

Then fall then summer
I even know what I would find

Then I continue to dream then
knowing the constituents
