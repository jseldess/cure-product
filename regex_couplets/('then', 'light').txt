('then', 'light')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
variegated reflected light

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Then fall then summer from my face
In the retroactive light

Then fall then summer
In the light of retroactive conversations

and then into rotating and directional space
stopped light with validated fields
