('then', 'live')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Which is a measure to never live out

Then fall then summer
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

blue and sun again a second, then night
Which is a pleasure to never live out

Then I continue to dream then
where I send and relive aside
