('then', 'low')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
slow

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
slow asynchronous

Then fall then summer
to the pillow

blue and sun again a second, then night
I am not allowed to see their face

then I can see only the back values
under pillowing a cloud

Then I continue to dream then
