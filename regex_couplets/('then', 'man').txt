('then', 'man')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

Then fall then summer
To my children Walt Whitman

blue and sun again a second, then night
not many face up

Then I continue to dream then
that of the man with the dyed blond hair
