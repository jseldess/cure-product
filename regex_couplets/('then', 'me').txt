('then', 'me')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Then I constellate my time family country

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
I assumed it was visible

Then fall then summer from my face
Then fall then summer

and then into rotating and directional space
Which is a measure to never live out

blue and sun again a second, then night
I had me a vision

Then I continue to dream then
I could consume the dream

Then I continued to dream then
I came after my past

I continued to dream then
And for an ungraspable time
