('then', 'morning')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
When I woke up in the morning

Then fall then summer from my face
before morning goals

blue and sun again a second, then night
