('then', 'myself')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
But I can’t let myself treat 

Then fall then summer
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

blue and sun again a second, then night
I was enjoined to act again myself

Then I continue to dream then
myself
