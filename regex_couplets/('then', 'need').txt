('then', 'need')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Then fall then summer
and can’t presume to need

blue and sun again a second, then night
I need the work

Then I continue to dream then
And need out in front purchase

I continued to dream then
where I need gravity
