('then', 'night')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Then fall then summer from my face
blue and sun again a second, then night

then I cannot see face value
I had nightmares though

Then I continue to dream then
dawn already formerly nights
