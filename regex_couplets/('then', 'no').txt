('then', 'no')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
asynchronous 

Then fall then summer from my face
not calling or echoing for once

Then fall then summer
on a snow day with my children

and then into rotating and directional space
or not even rotating

blue and sun again a second, then night
upsent in the afternoon

then I cannot see face value
out in the snow

then I can see only the back of values
out in the snow fall

then I can see only the back values
I can see only the back of their economic value

Then I continue to dream then
I used my technology

I continued to dream then
that nothing had gravity
