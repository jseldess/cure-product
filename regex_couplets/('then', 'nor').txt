('then', 'nor')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
into the minority proportion of time

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
over the long line I would honor

Then fall then summer
nor work in this way daily

blue and sun again a second, then night
the simple act of honoring an accountant

Then I continue to dream then
nor envy honest work
