('then', 'now')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
On a snow day with my children

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
who knows the way

Then fall then summer from my face
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

and then into rotating and directional space
for how can you know without direction

Then fall then summer
Right now I’m the cart

blue and sun again a second, then night
out in the snow

then I cannot see face value
out in the snow fall

then I can see only the back of values
out in the snow falling face value

then I can see only the back values
I take it out in the snow fall

Then I continue to dream then
knowing the constituents
