('then', 'off')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
off the edge of the world

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
I step off the edge

Then fall then summer from my face
Face falling off the edge of the face

Then fall then summer
value falling off the edge of the face

and then into rotating and directional space
I am first in the office 

blue and sun again a second, then night
off the end of the world

Then I continue to dream then
Sweets and coffee and juice

I continued to dream then
in the form filled offered in trust
