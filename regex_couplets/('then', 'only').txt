('then', 'only')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
only fragments of time with my children

Then fall then summer
only in the case

blue and sun again a second, then night
I see only the back

then I cannot see face value
I can see only values falling back

then I can see only the back of values
The planning process is for visionaries only

then I can see only the back values
I can see only the back of their economic value

Then I continue to dream then
would only willingly break
