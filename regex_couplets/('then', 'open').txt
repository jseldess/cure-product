('then', 'open')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Before we walk across the wide opening

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Then fall then summer
Before anyone buys up the opening

and then into rotating and directional space
my desires were open

blue and sun again a second, then night
The simple act opening surmounted

Then I continue to dream then
