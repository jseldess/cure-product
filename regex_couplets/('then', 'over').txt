('then', 'over')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I step over the edge

and then into rotating and directional space
If I step over the edge

Then fall then summer
over the long time up in the sky

blue and sun again a second, then night
oddly grown over with historic bark

Then I continue to dream then
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel
