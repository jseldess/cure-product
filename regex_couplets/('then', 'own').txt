('then', 'own')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
in a sharp downward turn 

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
In a sharp downard turn

Then fall then summer from my face
It keeps coming down thankfully

Then fall then summer
Being grown

blue and sun again a second, then night
oddly grown over with historic bark

Then I continue to dream then
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

I continued to dream then
the impulse for my own prospects
