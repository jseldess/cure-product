('then', 'pleasure')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Then fall then summer from my face
Which is a pleasure to never live out

Then fall then summer
there was no walking along the pleasure

Then I continue to dream then
