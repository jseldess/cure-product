('then', 'product')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
an impure product

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
What is an impure product

Then fall then summer from my face
as a cure product

Then fall then summer
as a pure product

blue and sun again a second, then night
the least productive of myself
