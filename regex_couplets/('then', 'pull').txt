('then', 'pull')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

Then fall then summer
I’ll pull my data higher up

blue and sun again a second, then night
