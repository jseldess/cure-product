('then', 'pure')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
an impure product

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
as pure as my children

Then fall then summer from my face
What is an impure product

Then fall then summer
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

blue and sun again a second, then night
