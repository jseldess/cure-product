('then', 'purpose')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
by no ventillation my purpose

Then fall then summer
until my purpose up in the sky

blue and sun again a second, then night
until I purpose the horizon

Then I continue to dream then
My purpose up in the sky

I continued to dream then
I tell you my purposes
