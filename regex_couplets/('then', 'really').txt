('then', 'really')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
because it was really dark

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
it was really sunny

Then fall then summer from my face
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Then fall then summer
When they really take hold of my finger

blue and sun again a second, then night
without really agreeing
