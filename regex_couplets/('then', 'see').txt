('then', 'see')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Then I cannot see face value

Then fall then summer
such as I see

and then into rotating and directional space
If I let myself see others desires

blue and sun again a second, then night
I see only the back

then I can see only the back of values
I see only the back of my habits

then I can see only the back values
I can see only the back of their economic value

Then I continue to dream then
Under the last seen principle

Then I continued to dream then
I see you knitting uproars with a bow
