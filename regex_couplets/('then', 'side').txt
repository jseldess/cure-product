('then', 'side')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I’m simply inside

Then fall then summer
aside from the retinas

Then I continue to dream then
But my not feeling the memory aside
