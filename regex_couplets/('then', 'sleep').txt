('then', 'sleep')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
where I sleep at times

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

Then fall then summer from my face
That’s where I sleep at times

Then fall then summer
Interrupted sleep or

blue and sun again a second, then night
like flattening sleep 

Then I continue to dream then
