('then', 'sleeping')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

Then fall then summer from my face
While I should be sleeping

Then fall then summer
Looking back while I should be sleeping

blue and sun again a second, then night
