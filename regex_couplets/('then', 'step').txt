('then', 'step')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I step off the edge

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I step over the edge

and then into rotating and directional space
If I step over the edge

Then fall then summer
What the next step

blue and sun again a second, then night
What’s the next step

then I cannot see face value
The next step 

Then I continue to dream then
step in by the prospect
