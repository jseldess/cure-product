('then', 'still')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
That is itself not still

and then into rotating and directional space
I love my daughter still

Then I continue to dream then
though we are still breaking in
