('then', 'story')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I told her a story, she drew waves.

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Forecasting the story before dawn

blue and sun again a second, then night
as far back as my history heard

Then I continue to dream then
