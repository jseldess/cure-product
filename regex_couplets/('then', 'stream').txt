('then', 'stream')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
into the stream of pictures

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
I can find a way to block it in the incoming stream

Then fall then summer
interjecting into the stream

and then into rotating and directional space
