('then', 'tell')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Then I constellate my time family country

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
So I constellate the time family country

Then fall then summer
I constellate the time

blue and sun again a second, then night
I had to tell them the news

Then I continue to dream then
I tell you my purposes

I continued to dream then
I tell you the weight of my purchases
