('then', 'them')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Then fall then summer from my face
That’s exaclty what I want for them

Then fall then summer
I can’t fix them without direction

and then into rotating and directional space
In a continuous theme

blue and sun again a second, then night
or argued for them at least

Then I continue to dream then
I designed them to hold up my underwear

I continued to dream then
Then I saw them interview
