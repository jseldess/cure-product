('then', 'time.')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Then I constellate my time family country

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

Then fall then summer from my face
only fragments of time with my children

Then fall then summer
where I sleep at times

blue and sun again a second, then night
The long time I had a vision

Then I continue to dream then
or alter of course the time anyway
