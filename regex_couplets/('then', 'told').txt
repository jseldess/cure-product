('then', 'told')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I told her a story, she drew waves.

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
I am told ventillation

Then fall then summer
I am told by no ventillation

blue and sun again a second, then night
which ran to be told
