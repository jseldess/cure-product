('then', 'too.')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

Then fall then summer from my face
emerging this year from too much standing water

Then fall then summer
learned without too much difficulty to code

blue and sun again a second, then night
Selma knows too
