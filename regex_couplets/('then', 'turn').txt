('then', 'turn')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
in a sharp downward turn 

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
In a sharp downard turn

Then fall then summer from my face
sudden downward turn

Then fall then summer
I keep turning back again myself

blue and sun again a second, then night
who knows how to turn it off
