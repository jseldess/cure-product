('then', 'up?')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I’ll pull myself another personality type

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

Then fall then summer from my face
my children’s consumption

Then fall then summer
The sun isn’t up 

and then into rotating and directional space
for how can you know without direction

blue and sun again a second, then night
upsent in the afternoon

then I cannot see face value
out in the snow

then I can see only the back of values
out in the snow fall

then I can see only the back values
I can see only the back of their economic value

Then I continue to dream then
I could consume the dream

Then I continued to dream then
Then I continued to dream

I continued to dream then
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
