('then', 'us')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
asynchronous 

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
because it was really dark

Then fall then summer from my face
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Then fall then summer
They’re just not mine

and then into rotating and directional space
slow asynchronous

blue and sun again a second, then night
So stay with us

Then I continue to dream then
Articles all around us

I continued to dream then
I wear suspenders
