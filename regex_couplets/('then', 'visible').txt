('then', 'visible')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I assumed it was visible

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

Then fall then summer
And make myself a visible

blue and sun again a second, then night
I assume the offers divisible
