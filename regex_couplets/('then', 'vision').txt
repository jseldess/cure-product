('then', 'vision')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
I had me a vision

Then fall then summer
The planning process for visions

then I cannot see face value
The planning process is for visionaries only

then I can see only the back of values
aspirating visions

Then I continue to dream then
there wasnâ€™t any television 

I continued to dream then
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
