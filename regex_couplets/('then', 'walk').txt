('then', 'walk')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Before we walk across the wide field

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Before we walk across the wide opening

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Then fall then summer
Before anyone walks across the opening

and then into rotating and directional space
there was no walking along the pleasure

Then I continue to dream then
