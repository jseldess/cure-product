('then', 'want')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
When I want something

Then fall then summer
I want to find a way to block it incoming

and then into rotating and directional space
I want but not to impart cynicism

blue and sun again a second, then night
all that I can think I want

Then I continue to dream then
I want to cite a poem so usual
