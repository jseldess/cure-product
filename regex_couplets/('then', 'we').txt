Then blue and sun again a second, then night
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

Then fall then summer from my face
We can wrestle them with their goals

and then into rotating and directional space
We had to say goodbye there

Then I continue to dream then
We had inhabited actually
