('then', 'were')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
When we had jobs that were to earn

Then fall then summer
my desires were open

blue and sun again a second, then night
I argued the days were longer

Then I continue to dream then
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
