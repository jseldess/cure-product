('then', 'When')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
When I woke up in the morning

Then fall then summer from my face
When I want something

Then fall then summer
When we had jobs that were to earn

blue and sun again a second, then night
When closed to my knowing

Then I continue to dream then
When I'm watching my tv
