('then', 'wide')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Before we walk across the wide field

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Before we walk across the wide opening

Then fall then summer from my face
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Then fall then summer
