('then', 'work')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

Then fall then summer from my face
nor work in this way daily

Then fall then summer
Having transitioned from leisure to work

blue and sun again a second, then night
your bid to the next highest ranked network

Then I continue to dream then
nor envy honest work
