('then', 'world')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
off the edge of the world

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Which can be pronounced to the world

Then fall then summer
The world 

blue and sun again a second, then night
off the end of the world

Then I continue to dream then
the opinions in my world
