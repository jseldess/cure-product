('then', 'you.')

Then blue and sun again a second, then night
Though how can you know without direction

and then into rotating and directional space
for how can you know without direction

Then fall then summer
You can hear it also through your leisure

blue and sun again a second, then night
That you can see only the back of

then I can see only the back values
your bid to the next highest ranked network

Then I continue to dream then
I tell you my purposes

I continued to dream then
I tell you the weight of my purchases
