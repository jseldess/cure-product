('there', 'A')

The prospects there already
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Of course there is a direction
All of the time

One day there is direction
Actually one day there is direction

Though there are quarters goals 
As though stationary and a destination

The edge isn’t even there
And put in place as though stationary

there are quarters 
And as an extension of the values

I’ll get there eventually
And make myself a visible

I’ll get there ruins
After having been contented

there was no promotion
As an extension of the values

that potential is there for you
All that I can think I want

there was no television to hear
A defeated

I get through there
COPY DREAM 

in traversing get through there
As a clone, illegally conceived

And we had to say goodbye to her there
Articles all around stores in surfeit

We had to say goodbye there
Articles all around us

We had to buy there
And need out in front purchase

 of those gathered
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

there wasn’t any television 
And from a weak distance

if there is anything 
And we could inhabit the room easy

after though there’s no memory
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

Is there a baby and a bear
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

Formerly away there are constant ways
A way I was going

my ethereal economic relations
Aligned or not with my interests

The offers there already
All that I own messageable

traffick is there nonetheless
