('there', 'And')

The prospects there already
And put in place as though stationary

Though there are quarters goals
And as an extension of the values

I’ll get there eventually
And make myself a visible

I’ll get there ruins
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

And we had to say goodbye to her there
And need out in front purchase

We had to say goodbye there
And read out in front

 of those gathered
And from a weak distance

there wasn’t any television 
And for an ungraspable time

if there is anything 
And we could inhabit the room easy

after though there’s no memory
