('There', 'As')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
As though stationary and a destination

There are quarterly goals
Assimilable or

There was very little physical activity
As an extension of the values

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
As a clone, illegally conceived

There are spots waiting
