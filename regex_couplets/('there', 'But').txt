('There', 'but')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
but not impart cynicism

There are quarterly goals
Attributable or

There was very little physical activity
but it continued rippling muscle

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I resume attributable visions

There are spots waiting
that decisions can be attributable

There are constant ways
but for memory elsewhere
