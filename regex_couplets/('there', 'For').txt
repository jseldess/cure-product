('There', 'For')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

There are quarterly goals
Forecasting the story before dawn

There was very little physical activity
For an ungraspable time

There are spots waiting
For Mitt Romney

There are constant ways
Formerly a way like this one

There are no constant waves
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
