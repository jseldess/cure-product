('There', 'if')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
if not directly on my skin

There are quarterly goals
drifting away needs others presume desires

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
if you have providence to excess

There was very little physical activity
That company creates a life

There are spots waiting
if there is anything 

There are constant ways
if only on the way to the trash
