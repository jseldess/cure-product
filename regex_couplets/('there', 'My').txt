('There', 'My')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
My associations

There was very little physical activity
My purpose up in the sky

There are spots waiting
My means without gravity

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
My daughter with her way

There are constant ways
My say to the elections
