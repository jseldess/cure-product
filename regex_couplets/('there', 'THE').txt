('There', 'THE')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
THE SNOW

There are quarterly goals
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

There was very little physical activity
THE OFFERS

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

There are spots waiting
