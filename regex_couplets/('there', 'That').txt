('There', 'That')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
That’s exaclty what I want for them

There are quarterly goals
That’s where I sleep at times

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
That’s when they really take

There was very little physical activity
That company creates a life

There are spots waiting
That I captured an afterimage

There are constant ways
That are my right to say
