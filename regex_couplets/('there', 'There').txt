('there', 'There')

The prospects there already
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Of course there is a direction
There are quarterly goals

I’ll get there eventually
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I’ll get there ruins
There was very little physical activity

that potential is there for you
There are spots waiting

if there is anything 
There are constant ways

Formerly away there are constant ways
There are no constant waves

my ethereal economic relations
