('there', 'though')

The prospects there already
As though stationary and a destination

The edge isn’t even there
And put in place as though stationary

Though there are quarters goals
though there are quarters with goals

with goals I find there
though it was most emphatically that

I’ll get there eventually
I had nightmares though

that potential is there for you
though not many freeze up

there was no television to hear
though in not many acts up in the sky

I get through there
I thought

if there is anything 
though we are still breaking in

there wasn’t any television 
after though there’s no memory

Is there a baby and a bear
I answered what I thought

my ethereal economic relations
