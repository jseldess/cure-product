('there', 'To')

The prospects there already
To my children Walt Whitman

I’ll get there eventually
To my chidren

I’ll get there ruins
Tomorrow

there was no promotion
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

I get through there
To neither study

if there is anything 
To the ends of transactions

Is there a baby and a bear
To the ends of my transactions

Formerly away there are constant ways
To the other end of transactions

my ethereal economic relations
To the right of determined elections

The offers there already
