('there', 'Where')

The prospects there already
Where official policy is to catch and release

I’ll get there eventually
Where I put it beating

I’ll get there ruins
Where I take my liesure

there was no promotion
Where I lead gravity

if there is anything 
Where I host my purposes

there wasn’t any television 
Where in me did I host

after though there’s no memory
Where in me did I loose

Is there a baby and a bear
