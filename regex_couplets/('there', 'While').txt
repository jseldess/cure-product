('There', 'while')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Looking back while I should be sleeping

There was very little physical activity
while wrapped in static

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
while wrapped in explicit static

There are spots waiting
I answered while interfaced
