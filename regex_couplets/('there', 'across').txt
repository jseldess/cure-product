('there', 'across')

The prospects there already
Before we walk across the wide field

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
Before we walk across the wide opening

Of course there is a direction
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

One day there is direction
Before anyone walks across the opening

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
across the retinas

that potential is there for you
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

I get through there
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
