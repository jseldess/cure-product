('There', 'actions')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
to the ends of my transactions

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
The ends of my transactions

There are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

There are no constant waves
The other ends of my transactions

There are no constant ways
The other end of my transactions
