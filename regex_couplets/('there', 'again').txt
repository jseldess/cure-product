('there', 'again')

The prospects there already
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I’ll get there eventually
at any time it can drift again

I’ll get there ruins
I was enjoined to act again myself

there was no promotion
I am bid to act again

that potential is there for you
I let it remind me again

if there is anything
