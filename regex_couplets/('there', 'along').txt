('there', 'along')

The prospects there already
bring your child along

I’ll get there eventually
The days lined along company

that potential is there for you
there was no walking along the pleasure

there was no promotion
there was no walking along

because there was no solid ground to continue along
walking along the measure

there wasn’t any television 
formerly along time they were on

Is there a baby and a bear
formerly along my say to the elections

my ethereal economic relations
