('there', 'already')

The prospects there already
already formerly a long time

if there is anything 
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

there wasn’t any television 
dawn already formerly nights 

Is there a baby and a bear
So I presume the offers already

The offers there already
So I resume the offers already

traffick is there nonetheless
