('There', 'any')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Before anyone walks across the opening

There are quarterly goals
at any time it can drift again

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
Or the company

There was very little physical activity
The days aligned for company

There are spots waiting
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

There are constant ways
The many transparent pixel calls

There are no constant waves
or imagined anyway
