('there', 'are')

The prospects there already
Though there are quarters goals

Actually one day there is direction
there are quarters 

We can rest there in them with their goals
though there are quarters with goals

with goals I find there
who are so fresh and agile

I’ll get there eventually
There are quarterly goals

I’ll get there ruins
barely outlines

there was no promotion
The days are long

that potential is there for you
but they are black spots

there was no television to hear
There are spots waiting

if there is anything 
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

there wasn’t any television 
still carefully

after though there’s no memory
though we are waiting for her

Is there a baby and a bear
There are constant ways

Formerly away there are constant ways
The many transparent pixel calls

my ethereal economic relations
 as points which are my interest 

The offers there already
careening between the preambles
