('there', 'around')

The prospects there already
Spinning around the heart

I’ll get there eventually
around my country 

I get through there
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

And we had to say goodbye to her there
articles all around us

We had to say goodbye there
articles all around storming around

We had to buy there
around the dogs and lillies

if there is anything 
More reasons around my country 

there wasn’t any television 
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

Is there a baby and a bear
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

Formerly away there are constant ways
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

my ethereal economic relations
