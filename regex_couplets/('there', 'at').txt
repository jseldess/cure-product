('there', 'at')

The prospects there already
by the private preambles

I’ll get there eventually
Then I constellate my time family country

Of course there is a direction
I reach repeated expressions first

One day there is direction
That’s exaclty what I want for them

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
and at my desk

On a day there will be direction
Put in place as stationary destinations

The edge isn’t even there
Rather it itself is rotating

Though there are quarters goals
not rotating

there are quarters 
into rotating and directionless space

We can rest there in them with their goals
and then into rotating and directional space

what I find there
attempted anachronism

I’ll get there ruins
Out of later results

there was no promotion
I am told ventillation

that potential is there for you
That company creates a life

there was no walking along the pleasure
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

there was no television to hear
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I get through there
in the sense of watching

I get from here through there
I watch a movie

in traversing get through there
I resume attributable visions

get from here through there
attributable visions

I get here through there
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

And we had to say goodbye to her there
of those gathered

We had to say goodbye there
And from that great distance

if there is anything 
if that has anything

there wasn’t any television 
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

after though there’s no memory
so still watch them

Is there a baby and a bear
The way that I was going

Formerly away there are constant ways
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

my ethereal economic relations
to return what I bought

The offers there already
at home brought into private

traffick is there nonetheless
The prospect for careening attached
