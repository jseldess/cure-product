('There', 'away')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
drifting away needs others presume desires

There are quarterly goals
drifting away from the task

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
Who throws contours away

There are constant ways
Formerly away there are constant ways

There are no constant waves
formerly away
