('there', 'been')

The prospects there already
It has been since

I’ll get there eventually
After having been contented

I’ll get there ruins
that having been after content

there was no promotion
having been graspable

I get through there
having been an ungraspable time

And we had to say goodbye to her there
Having been purchased out of you

there wasn’t any television
