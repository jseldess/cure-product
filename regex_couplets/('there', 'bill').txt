('There', 'bill')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
I hear it between bills and stuff

There was very little physical activity
I can hear it between bills and stuff

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
billowing in the cloud

There are spots waiting
until the bill came

There are constant ways
the bill my detuning
