('there', 'brought')

The prospects there already
brought messageable to you

I’ll get there eventually
I brought my head down

I’ll get there ruins
own stays brought loyal

if there is anything 
own that stays brought loyal

Is there a baby and a bear
that stays brought loyal

my ethereal economic relations
at home brought into privacy

The offers there already
at home brought into private

traffick is there nonetheless
