('there', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

The prospects there already
I can’t fix them without direction

there are quarters 
and can’t presume to need

I’ll get there eventually
Then I can’t presume to need others

I’ll get there ruins
That can’t be glimpsed

there was no promotion
Though we can’t help waiting

Is there a baby and a bear
I can’t remember them

The offers there already
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
