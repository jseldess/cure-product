('there', 'cannot')

The prospects there already
Then I cannot see face value

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

there was no television to hear
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I get through there
in that I cannot remember 

The offers there already
