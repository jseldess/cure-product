('there', 'children')

The prospects there already
On a snow day with my children

I’ll get there eventually
as pure as my children

Of course there is a direction
only fragments of time with my children

on a day there will be direction
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

I’ll get there ruins
Even the children

We had to say goodbye there
my possession of my children

if there is anything 
speech my possession of my children

Is there a baby and a bear
