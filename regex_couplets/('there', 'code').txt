('There', 'code')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
as long as I have access to the code

There are quarterly goals
May I have your zip code

There was very little physical activity
falling off the encoded end

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

There are constant ways
zipcode
