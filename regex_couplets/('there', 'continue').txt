('There', 'continue')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
but it continued

There was very little physical activity
but it continued rippling muscle

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I continue to presume

There are spots waiting
Then I continue to dream then

There are constant ways
