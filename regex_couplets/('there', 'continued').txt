('There', 'continued')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
but it continued

There was very little physical activity
but it continued rippling muscle

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
Then I continued to dream then

There are spots waiting
I continued to dream then

There are constant ways
