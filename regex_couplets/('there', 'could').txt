('there', 'could')

The prospects there already
and could be mapped and weighed

I’ll get there eventually
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

I’ll get there ruins
until I could not tire 

there was no television to hear
until I could not be tired

I get through there
I could in effect credit

I get from here through there
I could consume the dream

And we had to say goodbye to her there
and we could inhabit the room easy

if there is anything 
and could be inflected with reasons

The offers there already
