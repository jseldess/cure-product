('There', 'count')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Then I constellate my time family country

There are quarterly goals
So I constellate the time family country

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I brought my count down

There was very little physical activity
without the long time I was accounting

There are spots waiting
More reasons around my country 

There are constant ways
