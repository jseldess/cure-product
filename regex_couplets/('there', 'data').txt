('There', 'data')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
I’ll pull my data higher up

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I’ll pull my data

There was very little physical activity
The days of private data

There are spots waiting
trackers collecting data on users

There are constant ways
my interfaced stand data
