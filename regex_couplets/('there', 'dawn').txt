('there', 'dawn')

The prospects there already
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Of course there is a direction
Forecasting the story before dawn

I’ll get there eventually
dawn already formerly nights 

if there is anything 
dawn formerly

there wasn’t any television 
battery dawn nights 

Formerly away there are constant ways
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

my ethereal economic relations
