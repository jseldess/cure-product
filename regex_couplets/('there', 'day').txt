('there', 'day')

The prospects there already
On a snow day with my children

I’ll get there eventually
One day there is direction

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
on a day there will be direction

Though there are quarters goals
Actually one day there is direction

The edge isn’t even there
I argued the days felt longer

there was no promotion
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

that potential is there for you
The days are long

there was no walking along the pleasure
The day

if there is anything 
I have a memory between the day

there wasn’t any television 
at least most days

my ethereal economic relations
