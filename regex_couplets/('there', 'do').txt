('There', 'do')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
does not feel an exception

There are quarterly goals
in a sharp downward turn 

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
The dogs and lillies

There was very little physical activity
What I do in my liesure

There are spots waiting
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

There are constant ways
and it doesn’t take long
