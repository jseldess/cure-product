('There', 'eat')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
But I can’t let myself treat 

There are quarterly goals
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
was not just a defeat

There was very little physical activity
That company creates a life

There are spots waiting
And from a great distance

There are constant ways
for the creation of the universe
