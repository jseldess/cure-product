('there', 'edge')

The prospects there already
off the edge of the world

I’ll get there eventually
I step off the edge

Of course there is a direction
The edge is put in place

The edge isn’t even there
I step over the edge

though there are quarters with goals
If I step on the edge

what I find there
Face falling off the edge of the face

I’ll get there ruins
Falling off the edge of the face

there was no promotion
