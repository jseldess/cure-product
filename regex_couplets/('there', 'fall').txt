('there', 'fall')

The prospects there already
Then fall then summer from my face

Of course there is a direction
Then fall then summer

One day there is direction
and not falling at all

I’ll get there eventually
Face falling off the edge of the face

I’ll get there ruins
The value falling off the edge of th face

there was no promotion
falling off the encoded end

there was no walking along the pleasure
I take it out in the snow fall

there was no television to hear
