('there', 'feel')

The prospects there already
conversations with our feelings

Of course there is a direction
conversation with our feelings

One day there is direction
does not feel an exception

I’ll get there eventually
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

I’ll get there ruins
I tried to feel the key values extending 

there was no promotion
I tried to feel the extension of key values

that potential is there for you
What would I feel without that goal

there was no walking along the pleasure
But my not feeling the memory aside

if there is anything 
which feels more comfortable

there wasn’t any television 
which is what feels most comfortable

after though there’s no memory
But my not feeling the memory inside

Is there a baby and a bear
By my feeling the memory inside

Formerly away there are constant ways
which I feel formerly about for

my ethereal economic relations
