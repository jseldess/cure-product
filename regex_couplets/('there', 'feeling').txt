('there', 'feeling')

The prospects there already
conversations with our feelings

Of course there is a direction
conversation with our feelings

One day there is direction
But my not feeling the memory aside

if there is anything 
But my not feeling the memory inside

Is there a baby and a bear
By my feeling the memory inside

Formerly away there are constant ways
But my feeling the memory aside

my ethereal economic relations
