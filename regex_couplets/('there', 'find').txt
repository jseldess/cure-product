('There', 'find')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
I can find a way to block it incoming

There are quarterly goals
Companies increasingly find 

There was very little physical activity
I even know what I would find

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
So I find myself at home
