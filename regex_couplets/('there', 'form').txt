('there', 'form')

The prospects there already
There are performance reviews

I’ll get there eventually
Toward the start informally given my reasons

I get through there
already formerly a long time

if there is anything 
A way formerly like this one

there wasn’t any television 
in the form filled offered in trust

after though there’s no memory
in the form filled offered must

Is there a baby and a bear
formerly a way

Formerly away there are constant ways
formerly away

my ethereal economic relations
which I feel formerly about for

The offers there already
