('there', 'from')

The prospects there already
Then fall then summer from my face

Of course there is a direction
from the incoming stream

One day there is direction
Falling from this distance

I’ll get there eventually
drifting away from the task

I’ll get there ruins
out from below the fold

there was no promotion
shielding from the bandwidth

that potential is there for you
aside from the retinas

there was no walking along the pleasure
from which to step off

there was no walking along
promoting from home

because there was no solid ground to continue along
from home

there wasn’t any television 
I get from here through there

I get here through there
get from here through there

I get through there
And from a weak distance

if there is anything 
breaking from my constituents

after though there’s no memory
from no one point

my ethereal economic relations
