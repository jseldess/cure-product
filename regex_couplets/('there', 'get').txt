('there', 'get')

The prospects there already
I’ll get there eventually

Of course there is a direction
and is relentlessly budgeted

I’ll get there ruins
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

there was no promotion
I get through there

I get from here through there
I get here through there

in traversing get through there
get from here through there

And we had to say goodbye to her there
forgetting decisions 

if there is anything 
forgettable
