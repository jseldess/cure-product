('there', 'going')

The prospects there already
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Of course there is a direction
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

there was no television to hear
The way that she is going

if there is anything 
The way that I am going

Is there a baby and a bear
The way that I was going

Formerly away there are constant ways
way I was going 

my ethereal economic relations
