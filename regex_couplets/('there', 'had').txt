('there', 'had')

The prospects there already
If he had not carried one virtue

I’ll get there eventually
When we had jobs that were to earn

I’ll get there ruins
I had me a vision

there was no promotion
Since I had to hold the entire company

that potential is there for you
I had to tell them the news

there was no walking along the pleasure
The long time I had a vision

there was no television to hear
I had a vision

I get through there
we had to say goodbye

And we had to say goodbye to her there
We had to say goodbye there

We had to buy there
that nothing had gravity

if there is anything 
We had inhabited actually

there wasn’t any television 
in the space that it had

after though there’s no memory
I had entered my phone

my ethereal economic relations
