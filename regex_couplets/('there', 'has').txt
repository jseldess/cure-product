('There', 'has')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Before anyone has walked across the opening

There are quarterly goals
It has been since

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
in traversing my purchase

There are spots waiting
until I purchase up in the sky

There are constant ways
phase decisioned by the prospect
