('there', 'have')

The prospects there already
I have entered my phone

Of course there is a direction
before we can have a retroactive

One day there is direction
as long as I have access to the code

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
if you have providence to excess

I’ll get there eventually
If you have confidence regardless all else

I’ll get there ruins
I have them lost

I get through there
I have supporters

there wasn’t any television 
I have a memory between the day

if there is anything 
I have entered my purposes

after though there’s no memory
I have turned it off

Formerly away there are constant ways
and have no way

my ethereal economic relations
I have them trust in me

The offers there already
I have seen more than I can remember
