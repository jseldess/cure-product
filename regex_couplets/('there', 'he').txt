('There', 'he')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
All of the time

There are quarterly goals
There are performance reviews

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
You can hear it also through your leisure

There was very little physical activity
aside from the retinas

There are spots waiting
until I purchase up in the sky

There are constant ways
The other end of means

There are no constant waves
The other ends of my transactions

There are no constant ways
The other end of my transactions
