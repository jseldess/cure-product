('there', 'hear')

The prospects there already
You can hear it also through your leisure

I’ll get there eventually
and my heart rate

I’ll get there ruins
I hear it between bills and stuff

there was no promotion
I can hear it between bills and stuff

there was no walking along the pleasure
that I can hear

there was no television to hear
I cannot hear it between bills

I get through there
In my heart did I lose trust

Is there a baby and a bear
