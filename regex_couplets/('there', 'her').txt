('there', 'her')

The prospects there already
I’ll pull myself another personality type

I’ll get there eventually
where I sleep at times

Of course there is a direction
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

One day there is direction
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

on a day there will be direction
Though there are quarters goals

Actually one day there is direction
The edge isn’t even there

there are quarters 
We can rest there in them with their goals

though there are quarters with goals
with goals I find there

what I find there
others desires

I’ll get there ruins
where I can lay claim to ruins

there was no promotion
I’ll pull myself higher up

that potential is there for you
There was very little physical activity

there was no walking along the pleasure
there was no walking along

because there was no solid ground to continue along
there wasn’t any television 

there was no television to hear
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I get through there
I get from here through there

I get here through there
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

in traversing get through there
get from here through there

And we had to say goodbye to her there
of those gathered

We had to say goodbye there
We had to buy there

if there is anything 
Where I host my purposes

after though there’s no memory
Where in me did I loose

Is there a baby and a bear
Though we are waiting for her

Formerly away there are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

my ethereal economic relations
I learned the point where I am

The offers there already
traffick is there nonetheless
