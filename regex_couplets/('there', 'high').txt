('There', 'high')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
way high up in the inter

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
higher up in the results

There was very little physical activity
The sun high enough to enter directly 

There are spots waiting
The sun high enough to strike directly
