('There', 'imagine')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
since I can imagine movement

There was very little physical activity
since you can imagine movement

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
on behalf of imagined

There are constant ways
or imagined anyway
