('There', 'inter')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
interjecting on a day ambition

There are quarterly goals
way high up in the inter

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
hold at intervals riding forward

There was very little physical activity
Then I saw them interview

There are spots waiting
my interfaced stand data
