('there', 'into')

The prospects there already
into rotating directionless 

Of course there is a direction
into the stream of pictures

on a day there will be direction
interjecting into the stream

One day there is direction
into rotating and directionless space

there are quarters 
and then into rotating and directional space

what I find there
into a brigand and a murderer

I’ll get there eventually
into the well controlled climate

there was no promotion
talking into pheasants bending themselves

there was no walking along the pleasure
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

there was no television to hear
Then I saw into you

I get through there
entered into my purposes

if there is anything 
stopping into the prospect

there wasn’t any television 
step by into the prospect

Is there a baby and a bear
converting sight into a purchase

my ethereal economic relations
into liminal reflexing

The offers there already
at home brought into private

traffick is there nonetheless
stepping off into the middle
