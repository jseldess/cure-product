('there', 'isn\xe2\x80\x99t')

The prospects there already
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

Of course there is a direction
The sun isn’t up 

One day there is direction
The edge isn’t even there

Though there are quarters goals
Then the sun isn’t available

I’ll get there eventually
Then the sun isn’t up

I’ll get there ruins
but the sun isn’t up

there was no promotion
