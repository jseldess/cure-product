('There', 'just')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

There are quarterly goals
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
was not just a defeat

There was very little physical activity
it was not just a defeat

There are spots waiting
