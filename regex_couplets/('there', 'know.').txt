('There', 'know.')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
how can I know without direction

There are quarterly goals
I even know what I would find

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
even when close to my knowing

There are spots waiting
knowing the constituents

There are constant ways
who knows the way

There are no constant waves
that their knowing
