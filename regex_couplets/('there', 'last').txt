('there', 'last')

The prospects there already
What was the last time

there was no television to hear
under the last seen principle

in traversing get through there
Under the last principle 

And we had to say goodbye to her there
Under the last principle of purchasing power

there wasnâ€™t any television 
Where in me did I last

if there is anything
