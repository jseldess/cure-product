('There', 'leisure')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
You can hear it also through your leisure

There are quarterly goals
Having transitioned from leisure to work

There was very little physical activity
You can hear it also through static leisure

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
