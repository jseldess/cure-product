('There', 'let')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
But I can’t let myself treat 

There are quarterly goals
I let myself treat

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
It’s the third letter from the end

There was very little physical activity
I let it remind me again

There are spots waiting
