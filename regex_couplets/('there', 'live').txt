('there', 'live')

The prospects there already
Which is a measure to never live out

I’ll get there eventually
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I’ll get there ruins
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I get through there
where I send and relive aside

if there is anything 
where I send and relive

my ethereal economic relations
