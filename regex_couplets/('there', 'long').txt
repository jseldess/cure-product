('there', 'long')

The prospects there already
as long as I have access to the code

One day there is direction
bring your child along

I’ll get there eventually
over the long time up in the sky

I’ll get there ruins
over the long line up in the sky

there was no promotion
I argued the days felt longer

that potential is there for you
The days are long

there was no walking along the pleasure
there was no walking along

because there was no solid ground to continue along
walking along the measure

there wasn’t any television 
The long time I had a vision

there was no television to hear
without the long time I was accounting

I get through there
the long time I was on

I get from here through there
without longer damage

if there is anything 
already formely a long time

after though there’s no memory
already formerly a long time

Is there a baby and a bear
shone formerly a long time

my ethereal economic relations
in the long time they were on

The offers there already
