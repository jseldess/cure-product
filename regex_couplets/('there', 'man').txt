('There', 'man')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

There are quarterly goals
There are performance reviews

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
not many face up

There are spots waiting
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

There are constant ways
The many transparent pixel calls

There are no constant waves
