('there', 'me')

The prospects there already
brought messageable to you

I’ll get there eventually
Then I constellate my time family country

Of course there is a direction
When I want something

One day there is direction
Then fall then summer

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
only fragments of time with my children

on a day there will be direction
wrestling me to stay still

there are quarters 
Which is a measure to never live out

I’ll get there ruins
emerging this year from standing water

there was no promotion
On the timeline I was on

that potential is there for you
with full potential to movement

there was no walking along the pleasure
I had me a vision

there was no walking along
promoting from home

because there was no solid ground to continue along
from home

there wasn’t any television 
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

there was no television to hear
I resume attributable visions

I get through there
If I take a different measure

I get from here through there
If I take some different measure

in traversing get through there
I came after my past

get from here through there
I continue to presume

I get here through there
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

And we had to say goodbye to her there
For an ungraspable time

We had to say goodbye there
And for an ungraspable time

if there is anything 
I have a memory between the day

after though there’s no memory
Where in me did I loose

Is there a baby and a bear
But my not feeling the memory inside

Formerly away there are constant ways
By my feeling the memory inside

my ethereal economic relations
which I feel formerly about for

The offers there already
The prospects being seen by me

traffick is there nonetheless
I presume the offers
