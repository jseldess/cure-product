('There', 'mean')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
What does it mean to drift

There are quarterly goals
My means without gravity

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
latency which doesn’t mean anything

There are constant ways
The other end of means

There are no constant waves
To the other end of means like this one
