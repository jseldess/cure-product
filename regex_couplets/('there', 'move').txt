('There', 'move')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
since I can imagine movement

There was very little physical activity
with little reasons to move

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

There are spots waiting
and literally moved

There are constant ways
not literally moved about
