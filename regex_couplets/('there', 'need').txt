('there', 'need')

The prospects there already
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Of course there is a direction
and can’t presume to need

I’ll get there eventually
drifting away needs

I’ll get there ruins
I need the work

there was no television to hear
I need an explicit statement

I get through there
And need out in front purchase

We had to say goodbye there
where I need gravity

there wasn’t any television 
I tell you where I need gravity

if there is anything 
not needing to wait

after though there’s no memory
in need one in that best own

Is there a baby and a bear
need one in best own

my ethereal economic relations
that in need one best own

The offers there already
