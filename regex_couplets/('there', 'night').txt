('there', 'night')

The prospects there already
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I’ll get there eventually
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Of course there is a direction
blue and sun again a second, then night

there was no promotion
I had nightmares though

that potential is there for you
battery dawn nights blending themselves

I get through there
dawn already formerly nights 

if there is anything 
last night

there wasn’t any television 
battery dawn nights 

Formerly away there are constant ways
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

my ethereal economic relations
