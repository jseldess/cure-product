('there', 'nights')

The prospects there already
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Of course there is a direction
dawn already formerly nights 

if there is anything 
with dawn already formerly nights 

there wasnâ€™t any television 
battery dawn nights 

Formerly away there are constant ways
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

my ethereal economic relations
