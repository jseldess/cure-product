('there', 'no')

The prospects there already
Then I cannot see face value

I’ll get there eventually
asynchronous 

Of course there is a direction
on a snow day with my children

One day there is direction
if not directly on my skin

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
into the minority proportion of time

on a day there will be direction
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

Though there are quarters goals
They’re just not mine

Actually one day there is direction
how can I know without direction

The edge isn’t even there
not rotating

there are quarters 
Though how can you know without direction

though there are quarters with goals
or not even rotating

what I find there
slow asynchronous

I’ll get there ruins
there was no promotion

that potential is there for you
I take it out in the snow fall

there was no walking along the pleasure
there was no walking along

because there was no solid ground to continue along
may not be ingrained

there was no television to hear
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I get through there
even when close to my knowing

in traversing get through there
When closed to my knowing

And we had to say goodbye to her there
I used my technology

if there is anything 
The sun high enough to enter directly

there wasn’t any television 
who knows the way

after though there’s no memory
But my not feeling the memory inside

Is there a baby and a bear
It’s not marshal exactly

Formerly away there are constant ways
with no constant way

my ethereal economic relations
Aligned or not with my interests

The offers there already
for a while not to listen

traffick is there nonetheless
in that I cannot remember
