('There', 'nor')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
into the minority proportion of time

There are quarterly goals
over the long line I would honor

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
nor work in this way daily

There was very little physical activity
the simple act of honoring an accountant

There are spots waiting
nor envy honest work

There are constant ways
