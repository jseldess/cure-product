('There', 'now')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
on a snow day with my children

There are quarterly goals
Right now I’m the cart

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
out in the snow

There was very little physical activity
I take it out in the snow fall

There are spots waiting
knowing the constituents

There are constant ways
who knows the way

There are no constant waves
that their knowing
