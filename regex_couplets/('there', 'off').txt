('there', 'off')

The prospects there already
off the edge of the world

I’ll get there eventually
I step off the edge

Of course there is a direction
I am first in the office 

I’ll get there ruins
Falling off the edge of the face

there was no promotion
off the end of the world

that potential is there for you
from which to step off

there was no walking along the pleasure
falling off the end

there was no television to hear
Sweets and coffee and juice

We had to say goodbye there
Sweets and coffee

We had to buy there
in the form filled offered in trust

if there is anything 
in the form filled offered trust

after though there’s no memory
in the form filled offered must

Is there a baby and a bear
My daughter turns it off too

Formerly away there are constant ways
in track as offer asked 

my ethereal economic relations
iced coffee and sun position

The offers there already
So I presume the offers already

traffick is there nonetheless
stepping off into the middle
