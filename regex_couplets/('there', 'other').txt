('there', 'other')

The prospects there already
I’ll pull myself another personality type

I’ll get there eventually
others desires

I’ll get there ruins
On the other hand

there was no television to hear
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

And we had to say goodbye to her there
and other types of tracking technology

if there is anything 
I presume to others

there wasn’t any television 
to the other end

Is there a baby and a bear
the other end transactions

Formerly away there are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

my ethereal economic relations
I assume possession to others
