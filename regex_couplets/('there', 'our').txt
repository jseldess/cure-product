('There', 'our')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Of course there is a direction

There are quarterly goals
reasons resources

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
You can hear it also through your leisure

There was very little physical activity
or alter of course the time anyway

There are constant ways
The contours exchange with you

There are no constant waves
phrase them of our possessions
