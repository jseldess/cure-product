('there', 'over')

The prospects there already
I step over the edge

though there are quarters with goals
If I step over the edge

what I find there
over the long time up in the sky

I’ll get there eventually
over the time line I was on

I’ll get there ruins
hovering above standing water

there was no promotion
over the long line up in the sky

that potential is there for you
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

I get through there
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

And we had to say goodbye to her there
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

if there is anything 
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
