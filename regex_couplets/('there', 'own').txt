('there', 'own')

The prospects there already
in a sharp downward turn 

Of course there is a direction
Being grown

I’ll get there eventually
to the down arrow

I’ll get there ruins
oddly grown over with historic bark

there was no promotion
even when close to my owning

I get from here through there
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

if there is anything 
the impulse for my own prospects

there wasn’t any television 
own stays brought loyal

Is there a baby and a bear
in need one in that best own

my ethereal economic relations
for my own purposes

The offers there already
All that I own messageable

traffick is there nonetheless
