('There', 'potential')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

There are quarterly goals
I am full of potential

There was very little physical activity
with full potential to movement

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
