('there', 'presume')

The prospects there already
and can’t presume to need

I’ll get there eventually
Then I can’t presume to need others

I’ll get there ruins
I continue to presume

I get through there
I presume to others

if there is anything 
So I presume the offers already

The offers there already
I presume the offers

traffick is there nonetheless
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
