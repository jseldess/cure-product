('there', 'principle')

The prospects there already
under the last seen principle

in traversing get through there
Under the grass principle

And we had to say goodbye to her there
under the grasp principle

We had to say goodbye there
under the past principle

We had to buy there
Under the last principle

 of those gathered
Under the last principle of purchasing power

there wasn’t any television
