('There', 'pull')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
I’ll pull myself another personality type

There are quarterly goals
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
fish pulled out of the lake

There was very little physical activity
