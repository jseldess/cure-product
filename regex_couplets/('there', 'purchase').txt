('there', 'purchase')

The prospects there already
conversations with our purchase

Of course there is a direction
in traversing my purchase

there was no promotion
purchased out

And we had to say goodbye to her there
for an ungraspable purchase

We had to say goodbye there
And need out in front purchase

We had to buy there
Having been purchased out of you

there wasn’t any television 
until I purchase up the sky

if there is anything 
I have entered my purchases

after though there’s no memory
converting sight into a purchase

Is there a baby and a bear
for my own purchases

my ethereal economic relations
at the site of a purchase

The offers there already
