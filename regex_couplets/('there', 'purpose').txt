('there', 'purpose')

The prospects there already
by no ventillation my purpose

I’ll get there eventually
until my purpose up in the sky

there was no promotion
until I purpose the horizon

I get through there
of my purpose in conversing

I get from here through there
in conversing of my purpose

in traversing get through there
in traversing my purpose

I get here through there
in pursuing my purpose

And we had to say goodbye to her there
My purpose up in the sky

We had to say goodbye there
Until my purpose 

 of those gathered
I tell you my purposes

there wasn’t any television 
I tell you the weight of my purposes

if there is anything 
Where I host my purposes

after though there’s no memory
to the other end of my purpose

my ethereal economic relations
for my own purposes

The offers there already
