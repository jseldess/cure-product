('there', 'really')

The prospects there already
because it was really dark

Of course there is a direction
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

One day there is direction
When they really take hold of my finger

I’ll get there eventually
That’s when they really take

I’ll get there ruins
without really agreeing

if there is anything 
without really speaking

there wasn’t any television 
also didn’t really move

my ethereal economic relations
