('there', 'reason')

The prospects there already
reasons resources

Of course there is a direction
with reasons

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
with little reason to move

that potential is there for you
with little reason to aspiration

there was no promotion
Toward the start informally given my reasons

I get through there
More reasons around my country 

if there is anything 
and could be inflected with reasons

The offers there already
