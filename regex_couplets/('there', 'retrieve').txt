('there', 'retrieve')

The prospects there already
I send and retrieve the impulse

if there is anything 
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

Is there a baby and a bear
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

Formerly away there are constant ways
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

my ethereal economic relations
