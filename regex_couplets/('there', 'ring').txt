('There', 'ring')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
interferring 

There are quarterly goals
ring

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
hovering above standing water

There was very little physical activity
actually considering the end

There are spots waiting
firing and connecting somewhere

There are constant ways
The prospect for veering healthily
