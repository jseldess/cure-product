('there', 'say')

The prospects there already
we had to say goodbye

And we had to say goodbye to her there
We had to say goodbye there

We had to buy there
I ask say in that case

if there is anything 
we ask say in that case

Is there a baby and a bear
formerly along my say to the elections

my ethereal economic relations
I ask say in that phase decisioned

The offers there already
