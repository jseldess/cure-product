('there', 'see')

The prospects there already
Then I cannot see face value

I’ll get there eventually
such as I see

Of course there is a direction
in light of learning what we see

One day there is direction
If I let myself see others desires

I’ll get there ruins
where I can claim to see the ruins

there was no promotion
I see only the back of falling values

that potential is there for you
under the last seen principle

in traversing get through there
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

And we had to say goodbye to her there
Having seen more than 

if there is anything 
being seen by me

The offers there already
The prospects being seen by me

traffick is there nonetheless
The prospect for seeing healthily
