('There', 'side')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
I’m simply inside

There are quarterly goals
aside from the retinas

There was very little physical activity
actually considering the end

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
But my not feeling the memory aside

There are constant ways
But my not feeling the memory inside

There are no constant waves
By my feeling the memory inside
