('there', 'sky')

The prospects there already
over the long time up in the sky

I’ll get there eventually
over the long line up in the sky

I’ll get there ruins
until my purpose up in the sky

there was no promotion
though not many facts up in the sky

there was no television to hear
and stuff up in the sky

I get through there
Up in the sky

We had to say goodbye there
My purpose up in the sky

 of those gathered
While they’re up in the sky

there wasn’t any television 
until I purchase up the sky

if there is anything
