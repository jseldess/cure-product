('There', 'space')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
in rotating directionless space

There are quarterly goals
in the space that it had

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
though we are breaking in the space that it had

There are constant ways
in the fill space
