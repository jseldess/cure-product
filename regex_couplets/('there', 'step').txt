('there', 'step')

The prospects there already
I step off the edge

Of course there is a direction
I step over the edge

though there are quarters with goals
If I step on the edge

what I find there
What the next step

there was no promotion
from which to step off

that potential is there for you
step in by the prospect

Is there a baby and a bear
phase decision step in

my ethereal economic relations
step by into the prospect

The offers there already
stepping in the middle

traffick is there nonetheless
stepping off into the middle
