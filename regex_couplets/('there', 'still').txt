('there', 'still')

The prospects there already
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Of course there is a direction
That is itself not still

The edge isn’t even there
wrestling to stay still

there are quarters 
I love my daughter still

there was no promotion
though we are still breaking in

if there is anything 
still wash conserving

after though there’s no memory
so still washed

Is there a baby and a bear
