('there', 'stuff')

The prospects there already
between bills and stuffed animals

Iâ€™ll get there eventually
I hear it between bills and stuff

there was no promotion
I can hear it between bills and stuff

there was no walking along the pleasure
I can hear them between bills and stuff

there was no television to hear
and stuff up in the sky

I get through there
bills and stuffed animals

The offers there already
