('there', 'take')

The prospects there already
I take hold of my finger

I’ll get there eventually
When they really take hold of my finger

I’ll get there ruins
If I take a different measure

there was no promotion
If I take some different measure

there was no television to hear
to take the call

if there is anything 
and it doesn’t take long

my ethereal economic relations
