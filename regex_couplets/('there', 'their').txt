('There', 'their')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
We can wrestle them with their goals

There are quarterly goals
I am not allowed to see their face

There was very little physical activity
without their agreement

There are constant ways
to their other end

There are no constant waves
that their knowing
