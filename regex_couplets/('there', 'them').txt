('there', 'them')

The prospects there already
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Of course there is a direction
That’s exaclty what I want for them

One day there is direction
I can’t fix them without direction

there are quarters 
We can wrestle them with their goals

We can rest there in them with their goals
In a continuous theme

I’ll get there eventually
or argued for them at least

that potential is there for you
I had to tell them the news

there was no promotion
talking into pheasants bending themselves

there was no walking along the pleasure
I can hear them between bills and stuff

there was no television to hear
the opacity given to them

I get through there
I have them lost

I get from here through there
I designed them to hold up my underwear

if there is anything 
Then I saw them interview

there wasn’t any television 
pre-worn and still wash them

after though there’s no memory
 them

Is there a baby and a bear
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

my ethereal economic relations
abjure them with determining 

The offers there already
before I act on them
