('there', 'themselves')

The prospects there already
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Of course there is a direction
talking into pheasants bending themselves

there was no promotion
talking into percents bending themselves

I get through there
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

if there is anything 
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

my ethereal economic relations
