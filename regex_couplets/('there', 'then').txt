('there', 'then')

The prospects there already
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I’ll get there eventually
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Of course there is a direction
Then fall then summer

One day there is direction
and then into rotating and directional space

what I find there
blue and sun again a second, then night

there was no promotion
Then I continue to dream then

And we had to say goodbye to her there
I continued to dream then

if there is anything
