('There', 'They')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
They’re just not mine

There are quarterly goals
They are called aspirational

There was very little physical activity
They can be waived

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
They have very many choices

There are constant ways
They were filters
