('there', 'through')

The prospects there already
You can hear it also through your leisure

I’ll get there eventually
Back up through the results

I’ll get there ruins
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

there was no television to hear
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I get through there
I get from here through there

I get here through there
in traversing get through there

get from here through there
