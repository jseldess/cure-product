('There', 'time.')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
only fragments of time with my children

There are quarterly goals
where I sleep at times

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
So I constellate the time family country

There was very little physical activity
The long time I had a vision

There are spots waiting
or alter of course the time anyway

There are constant ways
formerly along time they were on
