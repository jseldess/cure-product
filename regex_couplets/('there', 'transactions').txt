('there', 'transactions')

The prospects there already
to the ends of my transactions

if there is anything 
The ends of my transactions

there wasnâ€™t any television 
To the ends of transactions

Is there a baby and a bear
the other end transactions

Formerly away there are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

my ethereal economic relations
