('There', 'turn')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
in a sharp downward turn 

There are quarterly goals
sudden downward turn

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I keep turning back again myself

There was very little physical activity
who knows how to turn it off

There are constant ways
I turn not sad exactly
