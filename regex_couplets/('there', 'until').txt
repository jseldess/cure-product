('there', 'until')

The prospects there already
until my purpose up in the sky

I’ll get there eventually
until I could not tire 

there was no television to hear
until I could not be tired

I get through there
until I purpose up in the sky

there wasn’t any television 
until I purchase up the sky

if there is anything 
until a happier time found

after though there’s no memory
