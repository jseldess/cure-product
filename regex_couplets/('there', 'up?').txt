('There', 'up?')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

There are quarterly goals
And as an extension of the values

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
You can hear it also through your leisure

There was very little physical activity
I argued that the days were longer

There are spots waiting
until I purchase up in the sky

There are constant ways
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

There are no constant waves
But my not feeling the memory inside

There are no constant ways
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
