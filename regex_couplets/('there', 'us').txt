('There', 'us')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

There are quarterly goals
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I want to cite a poem so usual

There was very little physical activity
So stay with us

There are spots waiting
a futile joyous white sun

There are constant ways
radiating from housing
