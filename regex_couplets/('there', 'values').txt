('there', 'values')

The prospects there already
And as an extension of the values

I’ll get there eventually
The CEO tells me to embody values

I’ll get there ruins
I see only the back of falling values

there was no promotion
I tried to feel the key values extending 

that potential is there for you
As an extension of the values

there was no walking along the pleasure
