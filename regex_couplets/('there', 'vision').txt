('there', 'vision')

The prospects there already
I had me a vision

there was no promotion
The planning process for visions

that potential is there for you
aspirating with little visions

there was no walking along the pleasure
there wasnâ€™t any television 

there was no television to hear
I resume attributable visions

I get through there
attributable visions

I get from here through there
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

And we had to say goodbye to her there
joined in my television

my ethereal economic relations
visions that can be attainable

The offers there already
revisions that can be attributable

traffick is there nonetheless
