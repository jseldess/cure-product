('there', 'visions')

The prospects there already
The planning process for visions

there was no promotion
aspirating visions

that potential is there for you
aspirating with little visions

there was no walking along the pleasure
I resume unassimilable visions

there was no television to hear
I resume attributable visions

I get through there
attributable visions

I get from here through there
visions that can be attainable

The offers there already
revisions that can be attributable

traffick is there nonetheless
