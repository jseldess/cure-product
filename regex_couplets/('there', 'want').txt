('There', 'want')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
When I want something

There are quarterly goals
I want to cite a poem so usual

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I want to cite a poem

There was very little physical activity
all that I can think I want

There are spots waiting
