('There', 'watch')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
when watching tv

There was very little physical activity
in the sense of watching

There are spots waiting
I watch a movie

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
When I'm watching my tv 

There are constant ways
where I’m watching my tv
