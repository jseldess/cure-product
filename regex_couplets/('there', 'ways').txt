('there', 'ways')

The prospects there already
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

Of course there is a direction
always watching

I get through there
deep into pathways from repeated travels

if there is anything 
with constant ways 

Is there a baby and a bear
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

Formerly away there are constant ways
with no constant ways 

my ethereal economic relations
