('There', 'We')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
We can wrestle them with their goals

There are quarterly goals
We had to say goodbye there

There are spots waiting
We had inhabited actually

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
We got paid one way by a voice

There are constant ways
We ask say in that case
