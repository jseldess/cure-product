('there', 'were')

The prospects there already
When we had jobs that were to earn

I’ll get there eventually
my desires were open

I’ll get there ruins
I argued the days were longer

there was no promotion
I agrued the days were longer

that potential is there for you
The days were long

there was no walking along the pleasure
they were on

I get through there
in the long time they were on

I get from here through there
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

if there is anything 
answered about 

there wasn’t any television 
by the sight of the hosting answered about

after though there’s no memory
formerly along time they were on

Is there a baby and a bear
I answered what I thought

my ethereal economic relations
that they were visible

The offers there already
that they were divisible
