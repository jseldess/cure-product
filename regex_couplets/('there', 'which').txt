('There', 'Which')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Which is a measure to never live out

There are quarterly goals
Which can be pronounced to the world

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
Which is a pleasure to never live out

There was very little physical activity
Which can be called confidence

There are spots waiting
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

There are constant ways
