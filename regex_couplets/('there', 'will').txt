('There', 'will')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

There are quarterly goals
will not be the same

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
that will spur me on

There are spots waiting
would only willingly break

There are constant ways
my daughter will learn
