('There', 'work')

There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time
nor work in this way daily

There was very little physical activity
I need the work

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
I walk up and don’t work anymore

There are spots waiting
nor envy honest work

There are constant ways
