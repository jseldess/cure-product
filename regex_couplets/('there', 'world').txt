('there', 'world')

The prospects there already
off the edge of the world

I’ll get there eventually
Which can be pronounced to the world

I’ll get there ruins
off the end of the world

there was no promotion
hauling off the end of the world

there was no television to hear
the opinions in my world

if there is anything
