('There', 'you.')

Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time
Though how can you know without direction

There are quarterly goals
You can hear it also through your leisure

There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer
if you have providence to excess

There was very little physical activity
since you can imagine movement

There are spots waiting
I tell you the weight of my purchases

There are constant ways
the young ripples inaudibly
