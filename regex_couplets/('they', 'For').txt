('they', 'For')

When they really take hold of my finger
Forecasting the story before dawn

of the habits they create
For an ungraspable time

they can be waived
For Mitt Romney

they should rise up
For my own purchases

formerly a long time they were on
Formerly a way like this one

formerly along time they were on
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen

that they were divisible
