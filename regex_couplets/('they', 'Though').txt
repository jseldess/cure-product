('they', 'though')

When they really take hold of my finger
I had nightmares though

but they are black spots
though not many freeze up

they were on
I thought

formerly a long time they were on
though it was most emphatically that

they should rise up
after though thereâ€™s no memory

formerly along time they were on
though we are waiting for her

time they were on
I answered what I thought

in the long time they were on
