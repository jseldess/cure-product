('they', 'To')

When they really take hold of my finger
To that impossible place

of the habits they create
Tomorrow

but they are black spots
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

they were on
To neither study

they should rise up
To the ends of transactions

formerly along time they were on
To the ends of my transactions

time they were on
To the right of determined elections

in the long time they were on
