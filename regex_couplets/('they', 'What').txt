('they', 'what')

When they really take hold of my finger
I invited most of what came next

but they are black spots
I even know what I would find

they were on
what literally moved

formerly along time they were on
I answered what I thought

time they were on
I assumed what I draw

in the long time they were on
I answered what I thought about

formerly along the time they were on
to return what I bought

that they were visible
