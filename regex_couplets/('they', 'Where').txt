('they', 'Where')

When they really take hold of my finger
Where I take my liesure

but they are black spots
Where I lead gravity

they can be waived
Where I need gravity

formerly a long time they were on
Where I host my purposes

they should rise up
Where in me did I host

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
Where in me did I lose

formerly along time they were on
