('they', 'act')

When they really take hold of my finger
I was enjoined to act again

of the habits they create
Not goals or tactics

of the habits they create.
I was enjoying acting against myself

but they are black spots
actually considering the end

they were on
we had inhabited actually

formerly a long time they were on
The ends of my transactions

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
To the ends of transactions

formerly along time they were on
to the ends of actions

time they were on
I turn not sad exactly

in the long time they were on
I return not sad exactly

that they were visible
before I act on them

that they were divisible
