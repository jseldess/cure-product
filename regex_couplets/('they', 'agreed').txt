('they', 'agreed')

When they really take hold of my finger
and to which I’ve agreed

formerly a long time they were on
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

they should rise up
and for which the plan agreed

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
that agreed one of rest

formerly along time they were on
that agreed home

that they were visible
that agreed to one the people

that they were divisible
