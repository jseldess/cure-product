('they', 'already')

When they really take hold of my finger
already formerly a long time

formerly a long time they were on
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
dawn already formerly nights 

formerly along time they were on
So I presume the offers already

that they were divisible
