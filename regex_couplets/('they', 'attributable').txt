('they', 'attributable')

When they really take hold of my finger
I resume attributable visions

they were on
attributable visions

they can be waived
that decisions can be attributable

formerly along time they were on
decisions that can be attributable

that they were visible
revisions that can be attributable

that they were divisible
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I assumed that they were divisible
