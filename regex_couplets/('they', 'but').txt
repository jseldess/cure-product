('they', 'but')

When they really take hold of my finger
but the sun isnâ€™t up

of the habits they create
but it continued

but they are black spots
but I can hear them

they were on
I resume attributable visions

in the long time they were on
attributable visions

they can be waived
that decisions can be attributable

formerly along time they were on
but for memory elsewhere

time they were on
decisions that can be attributable

that they were visible
revisions that can be attributable

that they were divisible
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I assumed that they were divisible
