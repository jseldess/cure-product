('they', 'came')

When they really take hold of my finger
I invited most of what came next

but they are black spots
I came back to me

they can be waived
until the bill came

formerly a long time they were on
and came home to rewind inflections

that they were divisible
and came home to rewind

I assumed that they were divisible
