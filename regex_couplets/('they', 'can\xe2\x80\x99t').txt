('they', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

When they really take hold of my finger
That can’t be glimpsed

they create
Though we can’t help waiting

formerly along time they were on
I can’t remember them

in the long time they were on
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

I assumed that they were divisible
