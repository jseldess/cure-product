('they', 'could')

When they really take hold of my finger
and could be mapped and weighed

Thatâ€™s when they really take
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

of the habits they create
until I could not tire 

they were on
I could in effect credit

in the long time they were on
I could consume the dream

they can be waived
and we could inhabit the room easy

formerly a long time they were on
and could be inflected with reasons

that they were divisible
