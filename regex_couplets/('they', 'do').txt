('They', 'do')

They’re just not mine
does not feel an exception

They are called aspirational
What I do in my liesure

They can be waived
One was up where it should be down

They can be weighed
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

They have very many choices
and it doesn’t take long

They were filters
I only think I don’t listen
