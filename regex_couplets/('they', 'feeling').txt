('they', 'feeling')

When they really take hold of my finger
But my not feeling the memory aside

they should rise up
But my not feeling the memory inside

formerly a long time they were on
By my feeling the memory inside

formerly along time they were on
But my feeling the memory aside

in the long time they were on
