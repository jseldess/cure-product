('they', 'front')

When they really take hold of my finger
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

of the habits they create
in front of the set afternoon

they create
in front of the set of regulations

of the habits they create.
And need out in front purchase

they can be waived
behind or out front or up above

in the long time they were on
