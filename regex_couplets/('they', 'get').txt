('they', 'get')

When they really take hold of my finger
I’ll get there eventually

That’s when they really take
I’ll get there ruins

of the habits they create
I get through there

they were on
I get from here through there

they can be waived
forgetting decisions 

formerly a long time they were on
forgettable

that they were divisible
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I assumed that they were divisible
and maybe forgettable
