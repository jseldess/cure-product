('they', 'hear')

When they really take hold of my finger
I hear it between bills and stuff

of the habits they create
I can hear it between bills and stuff

but they are black spots
as far back as my history heard

they were on
You can hear it also through your leisure

they should rise up
In my heart did I lose trust

formerly along time they were on
