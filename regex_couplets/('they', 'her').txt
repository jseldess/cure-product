('they', 'her')

When they really take hold of my finger
I’ll get there eventually

That’s when they really take
higher up in the results

of the habits they create
there was no promotion

of the habits they create.
There was very little physical activity

but they are black spots
Where I take my liesure

they were on
I get through there

in the long time they were on
I get from here through there

they can be waived
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

While they’re up in the sky
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

formerly a long time they were on
if there is anything 

they should rise up
where I send and relive

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
Where in me did I host

formerly along time they were on
I presume to others

time they were on
By my memory elsewhere

formerly along the time they were on
Cereal and others’ health

that they were visible
The prospects there already

that they were divisible
I assume possession to others
