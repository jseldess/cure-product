('They', 'here')

Theyâ€™re just not mine
Actually one day there is direction

They are called aspirational
there was no promotion

They can be waived
One was up where it should be down

They can be weighed
I tell you where I need gravity

They have very many choices
elsewhere my purposes

They were filters
where rights ended themselves
