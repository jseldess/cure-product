('they', 'if')

When they really take hold of my finger
out of the fifth page ruins

of the habits they create
That company creates a life

but they are black spots
If I take a different measure

they were on
If I take some different measure

in the long time they were on
if there is anything 

they should rise up
if that has anything

formerly a long time they were on
if only on the way to the trash

that they were divisible
