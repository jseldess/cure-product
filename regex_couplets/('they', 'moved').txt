('they', 'moved')

When they really take hold of my finger
and literally moved

they should rise up
myself moved literally as it is

formerly a long time they were on
and literally moved about

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
literally moved

formerly along time they were on
not literally moved about

in the long time they were on
not literally moved

that they were visible
