('they', 'need')

When they really take hold of my finger
I need the work

they were on
And need out in front purchase

they can be waived
where I need gravity

While theyâ€™re up in the sky
I tell you where I need gravity

formerly a long time they were on
not needing to wait

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
in need one in that best own

formerly along time they were on
need one in best own

in the long time they were on
that in need one best own

that they were divisible
