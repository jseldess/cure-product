('they', 'only')

When they really take hold of my finger
So that I notice I am the only one

of the habits they create
I can see only the back of their economic value

they create
The planning process is for visionaries only

of the habits they create.
only in the case

they were on
would only willingly break

formerly a long time they were on
if only on the way to the trash

that they were divisible
