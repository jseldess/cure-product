('they', 'our')

When they really take hold of my finger
or an available resource

of the habits they create
with four key value pairs

they create
your bid to the next highest ranked network

of the habits they create.

or alter of course the time anyway

formerly a long time they were on
reasons resources

Who throws contours away

formerly along time they were on
phrase them of our possessions

that they were visible
own best form to ourselves

that they were divisible
