('they', 'over')

When they really take hold of my finger
hovering above standing water

of the habits they create
oddly grown over with historic bark

of the habits they create.
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

they were on
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

they can be waived
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

they should rise up
for not paying sound overwhelmed

formerly a long time they were on
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

I assumed that they were divisible
