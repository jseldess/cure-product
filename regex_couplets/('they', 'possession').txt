('they', 'possession')

When they really take hold of my finger
I speak to them my possessions

formerly a long time they were on
my possession of my children

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
I speak them of my possessions

formerly along time they were on
speech my possession of my children

in the long time they were on
I stay the right of my possessions 

that they were visible
phrase them of our possessions

that they were divisible
Or can have seen offering possession

I assumed that they were divisible
seen having or offering possession
