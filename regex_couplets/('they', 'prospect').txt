('they', 'prospect')

When they really take hold of my finger
the impulse for my own prospects

they should rise up
the impulse my own prospects

formerly a long time they were on
stopping into the prospect

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
speech that is of by prospects

formerly along time they were on
decisioned by the prospect

in the long time they were on
The prospects there already

that they were divisible
