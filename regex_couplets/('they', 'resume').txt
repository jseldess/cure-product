('they', 'resume')

When they really take hold of my finger
I resume unassimilable visions

but they are black spots
I resume indelible tracks

they were on
I resume attributable visions

in the long time they were on
I continue to presume

they can be waived
I presume to others

formerly a long time they were on
So I presume the offers already

that they were divisible
I presume the offers

I assumed that they were divisible
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
