('they', 'seen')

When they really take hold of my finger
under the last seen principle

they can be waived
Having seen more than 

formerly a long time they were on
being seen by me

that they were divisible
Having seen more than I can remember 

I assumed that they were divisible
Or can have seen offering possession
