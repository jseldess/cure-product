('they', 'should')

When they really take hold of my finger
While I should be sleeping 

Thatâ€™s when they really take
Looking back while I should be sleeping

of the habits they create
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

formerly a long time they were on
they should rise up

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
