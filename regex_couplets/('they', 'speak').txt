('they', 'speak')

When they really take hold of my finger
not speaking

they should rise up
I speak to them

formerly a long time they were on
I speak to them my possessions

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
I speak them of my possessions

formerly along time they were on
speak them of my possessions

in the long time they were on
