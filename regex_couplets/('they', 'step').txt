('they', 'step')

When they really take hold of my finger
What the next step

of the habits they create
Whatâ€™s the next step

of the habits they create.
from which to step off

but they are black spots
step in by the prospect

formerly along time they were on
phase decision step in

in the long time they were on
step by into the prospect

that they were divisible
stepping in the middle

I assumed that they were divisible
stepping off into the middle
