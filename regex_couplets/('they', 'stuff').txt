('they', 'stuff')

When they really take hold of my finger
I hear it between bills and stuff

of the habits they create
I can hear it between bills and stuff

but they are black spots
I can hear them between bills and stuff

they were on
between bills and stuffed animals

that they were visible
bills and stuffed animals

that they were divisible
