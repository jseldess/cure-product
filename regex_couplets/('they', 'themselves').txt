('they', 'themselves')

When they really take hold of my finger
talking into pheasants bending themselves

but they are black spots
talking into percents bending themselves

they were on
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

formerly a long time they were on
battery dawn nights blending themselves

formerly along time they were on
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

time they were on
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in the long time they were on
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

formerly along the time they were on
