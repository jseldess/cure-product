('they', 'through')

When they really take hold of my finger
Back up through the results

Thatâ€™s when they really take
back up through results

of the habits they create
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

they were on
I get through there

in the long time they were on
I get from here through there

they can be waived
You can hear it also through your leisure

they should rise up
