('they', 'until')

When they really take hold of my finger
until my purpose up in the sky

of the habits they create
until I could not tire 

they were on
until I purpose up in the sky

While theyâ€™re up in the sky
until I purchase up the sky

they can be waived
until I purchase the sky

formerly a long time they were on
until a happier time found

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
