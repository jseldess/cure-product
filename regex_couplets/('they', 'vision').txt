('they', 'vision')

When they really take hold of my finger
I had me a vision

of the habits they create
The planning process for visions

of the habits they create.
aspirating visions

but they are black spots
I resume unassimilable visions

they were on
I resume attributable visions

in the long time they were on
attributable visions

they can be waived
there wasn’t any television 

While they’re up in the sky
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

formerly a long time they were on
joined in my television

time they were on
visions that can be attainable

that they were divisible
revisions that can be attributable

I assumed that they were divisible
