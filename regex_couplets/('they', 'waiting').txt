('they', 'waiting')

When they really take hold of my finger
There are spots waiting

While they’re up in the sky
Though we are waiting for her

formerly a long time they were on
Though we are waiting 

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
Though we can’t help waiting

formerly along time they were on
waiting out front or up above 

in the long time they were on
