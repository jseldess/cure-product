('they', 'were')

When they really take hold of my finger
I wish my desires were open

Thatâ€™s when they really take
I argued the days were longer

of the habits they create.
I agrued the days were longer

but they are black spots
they were on

in the long time they were on
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

formerly a long time they were on
answered about 

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
by the sight of the hosting answered about

formerly along time they were on
I answered what I thought

time they were on
I answered about

formerly along the time they were on
that they were visible

that they were divisible
I assumed that they were divisible
