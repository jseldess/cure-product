('they', 'world')

When they really take hold of my finger
off the edge of the world

Thatâ€™s when they really take
off the end of the world

of the habits they create.
hauling off the end of the world

but they are black spots
falling off the end of the world

they were on
the opinions in my world

formerly a long time they were on
