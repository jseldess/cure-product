('They', 'you.')

Theyâ€™re just not mine
Though how can you know without direction

They are called aspirational
your bid to the next highest ranked network

They can be waived
I tell you the weight of my purposes

They can be weighed
I tell you the weight of my purchases

They have very many choices
the young ripples inaudibly
