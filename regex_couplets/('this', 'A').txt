('this', 'A')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Arrayed out in such a nested way

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Falling from this distance
All of the time

attesting this is a chance
BREAK

emerging this year from standing water
And as an extension of the values

that I was the arm of this
As an extension of the values

nor work in this way daily
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

A way formerly like this one
All parties would be held for my own purchases

Formerly a way like this one
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

The other end of transactions like this
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

To the other end of transactions like this
A way I was going

that this is possible
All that I own messageable
