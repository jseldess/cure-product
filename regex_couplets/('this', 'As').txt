('this', 'As')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Ask who I am to suspend

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
As though stationary and a destination

Falling from this distance
Assimilable or

emerging this year from standing water
Aspirational strategy

that I was the arm of this
As an extension of the values

attesting this is a chance
As a clone, illegally conceived

nor work in this way daily
