('this', 'Bach')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I end up in Bach 

A way formerly like this one
I end up in Bach and Selma

Formerly a way like this one
I end up Bach

The other end of transactions like this
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

To the other end of transactions like this
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

Like this one other end of transactions
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

that this is possible
