('this', 'For')

We’ll have coffee this morning
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Falling from this distance
Forecasting the story before dawn

that I was the arm of this
For an ungraspable time

nor work in this way daily
For Mitt Romney

attesting this is a chance
For my own purchases

A way formerly like this one
Formerly a way like this one

The other end of transactions like this
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

To the other end of transactions like this
Forty-one seconds in

that this is possible
For a while I think I don’t listen
