('this', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

We’ll have coffee this morning
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
I’m simply inside

Falling from this distance
Right now I’m the cart

attesting this is a chance
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

that I was the arm of this
where I’m watching my tv

that this is possible
