('this', 'It')

We’ll have coffee this morning
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
It keeps coming down thankfully

Falling from this distance
It has been since

attesting this is a chance
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

that I was the arm of this
It’s not marshal exactly

Formerly a way like this one
It’s not marshall exactly

The other end of transactions like this
