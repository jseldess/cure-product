('this', 'My')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
My live connections to you

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
My associations

that I was the arm of this
My purpose up in the sky

nor work in this way daily
My daughter with her way

A way formerly like this one
My daughter helps too

Formerly a way like this one
My say to the elections

that this is possible
