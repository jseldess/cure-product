('this', 'That')

We’ll have coffee this morning
That’s exaclty what I want for them

Falling from this distance
That’s where I sleep at times

attesting this is a chance
That’s when they really take

emerging this year from standing water
That you can see only the back of

that I was the arm of this
That company creates a life

nor work in this way daily
That are my right to say

that this is possible
