('this', 'There')

We’ll have coffee this morning
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Falling from this distance
There are quarterly goals

attesting this is a chance
There was very little physical activity

that I was the arm of this
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

nor work in this way daily
There are constant ways

Formerly a way like this one
There are no constant waves

To the other end of transactions like this
