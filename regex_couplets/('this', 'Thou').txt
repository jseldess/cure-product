('this', 'Thou')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Though there are quarters goals

Falling from this distance
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

attesting this is a chance
Though we are waiting for her

nor work in this way daily
Though we are breaking 

A way formerly like this one
Though we can’t help waiting

Formerly a way like this one
