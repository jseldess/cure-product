('this', 'though')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
As though stationary and a destination

Falling from this distance
though it was most emphatically that

attesting this is a chance
I had nightmares though

that I was the arm of this
though not many freeze up

nor work in this way daily
I thought

A way formerly like this one
though we are breaking in the space that it had

Formerly a way like this one
I answered what I thought

that this is possible
