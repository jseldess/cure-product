('this', 'To')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
To my children Walt Whitman

Falling from this distance
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

attesting this is a chance
To neither study

nor work in this way daily
To that impossible place

emerging this year from standing water
Tomorrow

that I was the arm of this
Toward the start informally given my reasons

A way formerly like this one
To the ends of transactions

Formerly a way like this one
To the ends of my transactions

The other end of transactions like this
To the other end of transactions

To the other end of transactions like this
To the other end of means like this one

Like this one the other end of means
To the right of determined elections

that this is possible
