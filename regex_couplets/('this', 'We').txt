('this', 'We')

We’ll have coffee this morning
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
We can wrestle them with their goals

Falling from this distance
We had to say goodbye there

nor work in this way daily
We got paid one way by a voice

attesting this is a chance
We ask say in that case

that this is possible
