('this', 'Where')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Where I sleep at times

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Where official policy is to catch and release

emerging this year from standing water
Where I take my liesure

attesting this is a chance
Where I lead gravity

nor work in this way daily
Where I host my purposes

A way formerly like this one
Where in me did I last

Formerly a way like this one
