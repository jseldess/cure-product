('this', 'Which')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Which is a measure to never live out

Falling from this distance
Which can be pronounced to the world

attesting this is a chance
Which can be called confidence

nor work in this way daily
Which is a pleasure to never live out

A way formerly like this one
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

Formerly a way like this one
