('this', 'while')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Looking back while I should be sleeping

emerging this year from standing water
while wrapped in static

attesting this is a chance
while wrapped in explicit static

nor work in this way daily
I answered while interfaced

that this is possible
for a while to listen already

in that all this in private is messageable
For a while I think I don’t listen
