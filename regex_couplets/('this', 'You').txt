('this', 'You')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
You should ask who I am

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling from this distance
You use the most essential parts

emerging this year from standing water
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

attesting this is a chance
You need history

nor work in this way daily
You can have seen offering
