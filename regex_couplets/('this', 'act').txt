('this', 'act')

We’ll have coffee this morning
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Falling from this distance
In the retroactive light

attesting this is a chance
I was enjoined to act again

emerging this year from standing water
I was enjoined to act again myself

that I was the arm of this
There was very little physical activity

nor work in this way daily
The ends of my transactions

A way formerly like this one
to the ends of my transactions

Formerly a way like this one
It’s not marshal exactly

The other end of transactions like this
The other ends of my transactions

To the other end of transactions like this
of my actions

Like this one other end of transactions
the other end transactions

that this is possible
before I act on them
