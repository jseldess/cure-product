('this', 'already')

We’ll have coffee this morning
So I presume the offers already

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
already formerly a long time

nor work in this way daily
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

A way formerly like this one
already brought into privacy

that this is possible
for a while to listen already

in that all this in private is messageable
