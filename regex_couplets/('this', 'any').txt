('this', 'any')

We’ll have coffee this morning
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

Falling from this distance
at any time it can drift again

attesting this is a chance
Or the company

emerging this year from standing water
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

that I was the arm of this
The days aligned for company

nor work in this way daily
They have very many choices

A way formerly like this one
latency which doesn’t mean anything

Formerly a way like this one
The many transparent pixel calls

To the other end of transactions like this
or imagined anyway

that this is possible
