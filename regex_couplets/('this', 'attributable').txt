('this', 'attributable')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I resume attributable visions

attesting this is a chance
attributable visions

nor work in this way daily
that decisions can be attributable

A way formerly like this one
decisions that can be attributable

that this is possible
revisions that can be attributable

in that all this in private is messageable
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
