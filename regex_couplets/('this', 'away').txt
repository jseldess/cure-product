('this', 'away')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
drifting away

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
drifting away needs others presume desires

Falling from this distance
drifting away needs

attesting this is a chance
Who throws contours away

Formerly a way like this one
Formerly away there are constant ways

The other end of transactions like this
formerly away

that this is possible
