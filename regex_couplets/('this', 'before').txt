('this', 'Before')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Before we walk across the wide field

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Before we walk across the wide opening

Falling from this distance
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

attesting this is a chance
Before morning goals

that I was the arm of this
