('this', 'but')

We’ll have coffee this morning
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
but not impart cynicism

Falling from this distance
Attributable or

emerging this year from standing water
but the sun isn’t up

that I was the arm of this
but it continued rippling muscle

attesting this is a chance
I resume attributable visions

nor work in this way daily
that decisions can be attributable

A way formerly like this one
but for memory elsewhere

that this is possible
revisions that can be attributable

in that all this in private is messageable
but I own all that’s messageable
