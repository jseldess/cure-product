('this', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

We’ll have coffee this morning
I can’t fix them without direction

Falling from this distance
Then I can’t presume to need others

attesting this is a chance
That can’t be glimpsed

that I was the arm of this
Though we can’t help waiting

Formerly a way like this one
I can’t remember them

that this is possible
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered
