('this', 'case')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
only in the case

nor work in this way daily
I ask say in that case

A way formerly like this one
we ask say in that case

that this is possible
