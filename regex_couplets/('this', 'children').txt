('this', 'children')

We’ll have coffee this morning
On a snow day with my children

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
my children’s consumption

Falling from this distance
about my children’s consumption

attesting this is a chance
Even the children

nor work in this way daily
my possession of my children

A way formerly like this one
speech my possession of my children

that this is possible
