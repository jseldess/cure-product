('this', 'code')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
as long as I have access to the code

Falling from this distance
May I have your zip code

emerging this year from standing water
learned without too much difficulty to code

that I was the arm of this
falling off the encoded end

attesting this is a chance
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

nor work in this way daily
zipcode

A way formerly like this one
