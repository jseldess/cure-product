('this', 'constant')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
with constant ways 

Formerly a way like this one
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

The other end of transactions like this
with no constant way

To the other end of transactions like this
There are constant ways

Like this one other end of transactions
with constant ways to the other end

that this is possible
