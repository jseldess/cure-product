('this', 'daughter')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I love my daughter still

attesting this is a chance
with my daughter

A way formerly like this one
My daughter with her way

Formerly a way like this one
My daughter helps too

The other end of transactions like this
my daughter will learn 

that this is possible
