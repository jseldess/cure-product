('this', 'dawn')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Falling from this distance
Forecasting the story before dawn

that I was the arm of this
dawn already formerly nights 

nor work in this way daily
dawn formerly

A way formerly like this one
battery dawn nights 

Formerly a way like this one
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

To the other end of transactions like this
to the other end battery dawn 

that this is possible
