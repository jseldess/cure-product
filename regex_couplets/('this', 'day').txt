('this', 'day')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
On a snow day with my children

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
One day there is direction

Falling from this distance
I argued the days felt longer

that I was the arm of this
The days long aligned

attesting this is a chance
The day

nor work in this way daily
at least most days

that this is possible
