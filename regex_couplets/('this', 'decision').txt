('this', 'decision')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
the planning process for decisions

that I was the arm of this
attributable decisions

nor work in this way daily
forgetting decisions 

A way formerly like this one
decisioned to learn 

that this is possible
decisions that can be attributable
