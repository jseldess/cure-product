('this', 'do')

We’ll have coffee this morning
The dogs and lillies

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
In a sharp downard turn

Falling from this distance
It keeps coming down thankfully

attesting this is a chance
I brought my head down

emerging this year from standing water
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

that I was the arm of this
What I do in my liesure

nor work in this way daily
and it doesn’t take long

A way formerly like this one
I only think I don’t listen

in that all this in private is messageable
For a while I think I don’t listen
