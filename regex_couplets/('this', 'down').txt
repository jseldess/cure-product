('this', 'down')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
in a sharp downward turn 

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
In a sharp downard turn

Falling from this distance
It keeps coming down thankfully

attesting this is a chance
I brought my head down

emerging this year from standing water
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

nor work in this way daily
