('this', 'edge')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I step off the edge

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Face falling off the edge of the face

Falling from this distance
value falling off the edge of the face

attesting this is a chance
off the edge of the world

emerging this year from standing water
Falling off the edge of the face

that I was the arm of this
