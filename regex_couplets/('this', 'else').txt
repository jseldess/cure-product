('this', 'else')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
If you have confidence regardless all else

nor work in this way daily
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

attesting this is a chance
and elsewhere my memory of you

A way formerly like this one
elsewhere by my memory

Formerly a way like this one
By my memory elsewhere

that this is possible
