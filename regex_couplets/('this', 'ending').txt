('this', 'ending')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Falling from this distance
I tried to feel the key values extending 

that I was the arm of this
talking into pheasants bending themselves

attesting this is a chance
talking into percents bending themselves

nor work in this way daily
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

A way formerly like this one
battery dawn nights ending themselves

that this is possible
