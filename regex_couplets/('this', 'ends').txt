('this', 'ends')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
to the ends of my transactions

nor work in this way daily
The ends of my transactions

A way formerly like this one
to the ends

Formerly a way like this one
with her ways to the ends

The other end of transactions like this
The other ends of my transactions

To the other end of transactions like this
