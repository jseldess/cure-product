('this', 'enter')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I have entered my phone

Falling from this distance
The sun high enough to enter directly 

attesting this is a chance
I enter the flattening mirror

nor work in this way daily
I have entered my purposes

A way formerly like this one
I had entered my phone

that this is possible
