('this', 'fall')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Then fall then summer from my face

Falling from this distance
and not falling at all

attesting this is a chance
Then fall then summer

emerging this year from standing water
Face falling off the edge of the face

that I was the arm of this
falling off the encoded end

nor work in this way daily
