('this', 'feel')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
conversations with our feelings

Falling from this distance
I tried to feel the key values extending 

that I was the arm of this
What would I feel without that goal

attesting this is a chance
But my not feeling the memory aside

A way formerly like this one
But my not feeling the memory inside

Formerly a way like this one
By my feeling the memory inside

The other end of transactions like this
which I feel formerly about for

that this is possible
