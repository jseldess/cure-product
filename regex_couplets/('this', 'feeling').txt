('this', 'feeling')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
conversations with our feelings

Falling from this distance
But my not feeling the memory aside

A way formerly like this one
But my not feeling the memory inside

Formerly a way like this one
By my feeling the memory inside

The other end of transactions like this
But my feeling the memory aside

that this is possible
