('this', 'field')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Before we walk across the wide field

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
stopped light with validated variegated fields

Falling from this distance
Before anyone has walked across the field

attesting this is a chance
stopped light with validated fields

A way formerly like this one
