('this', 'form')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
There are performance reviews

Falling from this distance
Toward the start informally given my reasons

attesting this is a chance
already formerly a long time

nor work in this way daily
A way formerly like this one

Formerly a way like this one
formerly a way

The other end of transactions like this
formerly away

that this is possible
