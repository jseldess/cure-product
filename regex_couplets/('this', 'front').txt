('this', 'front')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Falling from this distance
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

emerging this year from standing water
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

that I was the arm of this
And need out in front purchase

nor work in this way daily
behind or out front or up above

that this is possible
