('this', 'full')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
It keeps coming down thankfully

Falling from this distance
I am full of potential

that I was the arm of this
with full potential to movement

attesting this is a chance
full of the missing words

nor work in this way daily
still carefully

A way formerly like this one
