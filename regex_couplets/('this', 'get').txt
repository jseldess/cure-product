('this', 'get')

We’ll have coffee this morning
I’ll get there eventually

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
and is relentlessly budgeted

Falling from this distance
I’ll get there ruins

emerging this year from standing water
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

that I was the arm of this
I get through there

nor work in this way daily
forgetting decisions 

A way formerly like this one
forgettable
