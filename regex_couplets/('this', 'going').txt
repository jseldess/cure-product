('this', 'going')

We’ll have coffee this morning
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

attesting this is a chance
The way that she is going

A way formerly like this one
The way that I am going

Formerly a way like this one
The way that I was going

The other end of transactions like this
way I was going 

that this is possible
