('this', 'has')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
conversations with our purchase

Falling from this distance
It has been since

attesting this is a chance
in traversing my purchase

nor work in this way daily
I have entered my purchases

A way formerly like this one
for my own purchases

Formerly a way like this one
He has turned it off

The other end of transactions like this
phase decisioned by the prospect

that this is possible
converting sight into a purchase
