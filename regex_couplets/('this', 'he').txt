('this', 'he')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Where I sleep at times

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

Falling from this distance
Face falling off the edge of the face

attesting this is a chance
only in the case

nor work in this way daily
The South Carolina primary 

emerging this year from standing water
from where I can claim

emerging this year from too much standing water
to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water

that I was the arm of this
The days long aligned

A way formerly like this one
The constituents would be helped

Formerly a way like this one
to the other end

The other end of transactions like this
who knows the way

To the other end of transactions like this
By my feeling the memory inside

Like this one other end of transactions
To the other end of means like this one

Like this one the other end of means
the other end transactions

that this is possible
So I presume the offers already

in that all this in private is messageable
traffick is there nonetheless
