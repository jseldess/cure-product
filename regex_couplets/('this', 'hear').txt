('this', 'hear')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling from this distance
and my heart rate

emerging this year from standing water
I hear it between bills and stuff

that I was the arm of this
I can hear it between bills and stuff

attesting this is a chance
In my heart did I lose trust

A way formerly like this one
