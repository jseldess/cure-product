('this', 'here')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Where I sleep at times

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Of course there is a direction

Falling from this distance
I’ll get there eventually

attesting this is a chance
Where official policy is to catch and release

emerging this year from standing water
from where I can claim

emerging this year from too much standing water
there was no promotion

that I was the arm of this
There was very little physical activity

nor work in this way daily
and elsewhere my memory of you

A way formerly like this one
where I send and relive would be held

Formerly a way like this one
Is there a baby and a bear

The other end of transactions like this
There are no constant waves

To the other end of transactions like this
There are constant ways

Like this one other end of transactions
where rights ended themselves

that this is possible
traffick is there nonetheless
