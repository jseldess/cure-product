('this', 'high')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
way high up in the inter

Falling from this distance
way high up in the internet

attesting this is a chance
higher up in the results

emerging this year from standing water
high up in the internet

that I was the arm of this
The sun high enough to enter directly 

nor work in this way daily
The sun high enough to strike directly
