('this', 'hold')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I take hold of my finger

attesting this is a chance
When they really take hold of my finger

emerging this year from standing water
Since I had to hold the entire company

that I was the arm of this
and hold and wish to hold

nor work in this way daily
