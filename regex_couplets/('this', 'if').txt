('this', 'if')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
drifting away

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
if not directly on my skin

Falling from this distance
drifting away needs

attesting this is a chance
if he had not carried one virtue 

nor work in this way daily
out of the fifth page ruins

emerging this year from standing water
learned without too much difficulty to code

that I was the arm of this
That company creates a life

A way formerly like this one
if there is anything 

Formerly a way like this one
if only on the way to the trash

that this is possible
