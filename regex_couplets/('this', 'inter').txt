('this', 'inter')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Falling from this distance
interjecting on a day ambition

attesting this is a chance
hold at intervals riding forward

emerging this year from standing water
high up in the internet

that I was the arm of this
Then I saw them interview

nor work in this way daily
my interfaced stand data

that this is possible
