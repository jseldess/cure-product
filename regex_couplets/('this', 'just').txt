('this', 'just')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

Falling from this distance
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

attesting this is a chance
was not just a defeat

emerging this year from standing water
I just got a letter

that I was the arm of this
it was not just a defeat

nor work in this way daily
