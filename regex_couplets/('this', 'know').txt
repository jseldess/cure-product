('this', 'know')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
who knows the way

Falling from this distance
how can I know without direction

attesting this is a chance
I even know what I would find

nor work in this way daily
knowing the constituents

A way formerly like this one
who knows how to turn it off

Formerly a way like this one
who know the ways to their other end

To the other end of transactions like this
that their knowing

that this is possible
