('this', 'learn')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
in light of learning what we see

Falling from this distance
I spend time online learning to code

emerging this year from standing water
learned without too much difficulty to code

that I was the arm of this
decisioned to learn 

A way formerly like this one
decisioned to learn back

that this is possible
