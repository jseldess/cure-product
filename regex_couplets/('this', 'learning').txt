('this', 'learning')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
in light of learning what we see

Falling from this distance
I spend time online learning to code

emerging this year from standing water
Then I am learning to code

that I was the arm of this
phase decision for learning

A way formerly like this one
for learning by the prospect

that this is possible
