('this', 'light')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
variegated reflected light

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Falling from this distance
In the retroactive light

attesting this is a chance
stopped light with validated fields

A way formerly like this one
where lights blended themselves

that this is possible
