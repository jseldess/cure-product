('this', 'live')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I suspend live connections to you

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Which is a measure to never live out

Falling from this distance
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

attesting this is a chance
Which is a pleasure to never live out

nor work in this way daily
where I send and relive aside

A way formerly like this one
where I send and relive would be held

Formerly a way like this one
where I send and relive

that this is possible
