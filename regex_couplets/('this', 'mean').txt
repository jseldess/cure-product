('this', 'mean')

We’ll have coffee this morning
What does it mean to drift

Falling from this distance
My means without gravity

nor work in this way daily
latency which doesn’t mean anything

A way formerly like this one
The other end of means

The other end of transactions like this
To the other end of means like this one

Like this one the other end of means
