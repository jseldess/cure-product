('this', 'need')

We’ll have coffee this morning
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Falling from this distance
drifting away needs

attesting this is a chance
I need the work

nor work in this way daily
not needing to wait

A way formerly like this one
in need one in that best own

that this is possible
