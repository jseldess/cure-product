('this', 'nor')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
into the minority proportion of time

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
over the long line I would honor

attesting this is a chance
nor work in this way daily

emerging this year from standing water
the simple act of honoring an accountant

A way formerly like this one
which had on honor to be told

Formerly a way like this one
Prelude (Fantasy) in A Minor

that this is possible
