('this', 'now')

We’ll have coffee this morning
On a snow day with my children

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
who knows the way

Falling from this distance
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

attesting this is a chance
Right now I’m the cart

that I was the arm of this
I take it out in the snow fall

nor work in this way daily
knowing the constituents

A way formerly like this one
who knows how to turn it off

Formerly a way like this one
who know the ways to their other end

To the other end of transactions like this
that their knowing

that this is possible
