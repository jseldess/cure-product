('this', 'offer')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
So I presume the offers already

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
in the form filled offered in trust

nor work in this way daily
in the form filled offered trust

A way formerly like this one
in track as offer asked 

that this is possible
So I presume the offers

in that all this in private is messageable
I presume the offers
