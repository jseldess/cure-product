('this', 'only')

We’ll have coffee this morning
only fragments of time with my children

Falling from this distance
only in the case

nor work in this way daily
So that I notice I am the only one

that I was the arm of this
would only willingly break

A way formerly like this one
if only on the way to the trash

that this is possible
I only think I don’t listen

in that all this in private is messageable
less only money
