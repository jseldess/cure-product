('this', 'open')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Before we walk across the wide opening

Falling from this distance
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

attesting this is a chance
my desires were open

emerging this year from standing water
The simple act opening surmounted

nor work in this way daily
