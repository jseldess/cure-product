('this', 'our')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
reasons resources

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
conversations with our purchase

Falling from this distance
You can hear it also through your leisure

attesting this is a chance
Two hours and

emerging this year from standing water
or an available resource

that I was the arm of this
or alter of course the time anyway

nor work in this way daily
This is your voice 

A way formerly like this one
Who throws contours away

Formerly a way like this one
who throws contours a way

The other end of transactions like this
The contours exchange with you

To the other end of transactions like this
phrase them of our possessions

that this is possible
