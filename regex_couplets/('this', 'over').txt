('this', 'over')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I step over the edge

Falling from this distance
over the long time up in the sky

attesting this is a chance
hovering above standing water

emerging this year from standing water
over the time line I was on

that I was the arm of this
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

nor work in this way daily
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

A way formerly like this one
for not paying sound overwhelmed

Formerly a way like this one
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
