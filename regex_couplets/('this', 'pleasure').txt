('this', 'pleasure')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Which is a pleasure to never live out

attesting this is a chance
there was no walking along the pleasure

nor work in this way daily
