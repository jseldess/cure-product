('this', 'prospect')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
The prospects there already

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
the impulse for my own prospects

A way formerly like this one
the impulse my own prospects

Formerly a way like this one
stopping into the prospect

that this is possible
The prospect for careening attached
