('this', 'pull')

We’ll have coffee this morning
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

Falling from this distance
I’ll pull my data higher up

attesting this is a chance
fish pulled out of the lake

emerging this year from standing water
I’ll pull myself higher up

that I was the arm of this
