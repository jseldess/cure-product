('this', 'pulse')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
impulse control

emerging this year from standing water
I send and retrieve the impulse

A way formerly like this one
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

Formerly a way like this one
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

The other end of transactions like this
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

To the other end of transactions like this
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

that this is possible
