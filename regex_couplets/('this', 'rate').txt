('this', 'rate')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

Falling from this distance
and my heart rate

emerging this year from standing water
Strategy comes before morning

that I was the arm of this
I aspirate with little vision

attesting this is a chance
