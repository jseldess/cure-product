('this', 'really')

We’ll have coffee this morning
because it was really dark

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
it was really sunny

Falling from this distance
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

attesting this is a chance
When they really take hold of my finger

emerging this year from standing water
without really agreeing

nor work in this way daily
without really speaking

A way formerly like this one
also didn’t really move

that this is possible
