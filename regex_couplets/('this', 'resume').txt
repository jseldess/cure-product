('this', 'resume')

We’ll have coffee this morning
So I presume the offers already

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
and can’t presume to need

Falling from this distance
Then I can’t presume to need others

attesting this is a chance
I resume unassimilable visions

nor work in this way daily
I presume to others

A way formerly like this one
I presume the offers

that this is possible
So I presume the offers

in that all this in private is messageable
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
