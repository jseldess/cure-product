('this', 'sleep')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Where I sleep at times

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
So I went back to sleep

Falling from this distance
That’s where I sleep at times

attesting this is a chance
Interrupted sleep or

emerging this year from standing water
like flattening sleep 

nor work in this way daily
