('this', 'step')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I step off the edge

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
I step over the edge

Falling from this distance
What the next step

that I was the arm of this
from which to step off

attesting this is a chance
step in by the prospect

A way formerly like this one
phase decision step in

that this is possible
stepping in the middle
