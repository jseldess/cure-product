('this', 'still')

We’ll have coffee this morning
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
That is itself not still

Falling from this distance
I love my daughter still

attesting this is a chance
though we are still breaking in

A way formerly like this one
still wash conserving

Formerly a way like this one
