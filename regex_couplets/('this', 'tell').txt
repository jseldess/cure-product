('this', 'tell')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Then I constellate my time family country

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
So I constellate the time family country

Falling from this distance
I constellate the time

attesting this is a chance
The CEO tells me to embody values

emerging this year from standing water
I had to tell them the news

nor work in this way daily
and that man comes on to tell me 

A way formerly like this one
