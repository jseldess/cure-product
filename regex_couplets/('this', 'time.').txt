('this', 'time.')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Where I sleep at times

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
only fragments of time with my children

Falling from this distance
over the long time up in the sky

attesting this is a chance
 and time in the train

emerging this year from standing water
On the timeline I was on

that I was the arm of this
The long time I had a vision

nor work in this way daily
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

A way formerly like this one
until a happier time found

Formerly a way like this one
formerly along time they were on

that this is possible
