('this', 'told')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I told her a story, she drew waves.

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
I am told ventillation

attesting this is a chance
I am told by no ventillation

that I was the arm of this
which ran to be told

A way formerly like this one
