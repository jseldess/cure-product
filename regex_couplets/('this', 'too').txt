('this', 'too')

We’ll have coffee this morning
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
too sunny to eat ice cream

Falling from this distance
emerging this year from too much standing water

that I was the arm of this
Selma knows too 

Formerly a way like this one
