('this', 'transactions')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
to the ends of my transactions

nor work in this way daily
The ends of my transactions

A way formerly like this one
the other end transactions

Formerly a way like this one
The other end of transactions like this

To the other end of transactions like this
Like this one other end of transactions

To the other end of means like this one
to the other end of transactions

that this is possible
