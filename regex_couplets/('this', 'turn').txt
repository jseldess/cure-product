('this', 'turn')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
in a sharp downward turn 

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
In a sharp downard turn

Falling from this distance
sudden downward turn

attesting this is a chance
I keep turning back again myself

emerging this year from standing water
who knows how to turn it off

Formerly a way like this one
I turn not sad exactly

that this is possible
