('this', 'us')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
I suspend live connections to you

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Falling from this distance
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

attesting this is a chance
was not just a defeat

emerging this year from standing water
The ventillation rushes on

that I was the arm of this
So stay with us

nor work in this way daily
trackers collecting data on users

A way formerly like this one
in the form filled offered in trust

Formerly a way like this one
radiating from housing

that this is possible
