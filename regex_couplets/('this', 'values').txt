('this', 'values')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
And as an extension of the values

Falling from this distance
The CEO tells me to embody values

emerging this year from standing water
I see only the back of falling values

that I was the arm of this
As an extension of the values

attesting this is a chance
