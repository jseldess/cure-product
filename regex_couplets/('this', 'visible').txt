('this', 'visible')

We’ll have coffee this morning
I assumed it was visible

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

Falling from this distance
And make myself a visible

attesting this is a chance
Divisible or

emerging this year from standing water
I assume the offers divisible

that this is possible
that they were divisible
