('this', 'vision')

We’ll have coffee this morning
I had me a vision

Falling from this distance
The planning process for visions

that I was the arm of this
aspirating with visions

attesting this is a chance
The long time I had a vision

nor work in this way daily
there wasn’t any television 

A way formerly like this one
joined in my television

that this is possible
revisions that can be attributable

in that all this in private is messageable
