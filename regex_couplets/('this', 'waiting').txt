('this', 'waiting')

We’ll have coffee this morning
There are spots waiting

nor work in this way daily
Though we are waiting for her

A way formerly like this one
Though we are waiting 

Formerly a way like this one
Though we can’t help waiting

The other end of transactions like this
waiting out front or up above 

that this is possible
