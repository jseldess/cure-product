('this', 'walk')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Before we walk across the wide field

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Before we walk across the wide opening

Falling from this distance
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

attesting this is a chance
there was no walking along the pleasure

nor work in this way daily
