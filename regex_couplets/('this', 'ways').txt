('this', 'ways')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

Falling from this distance
always watching

nor work in this way daily
deep into pathways from repeated travels

A way formerly like this one
with constant ways 

Formerly a way like this one
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

The other end of transactions like this
with no constant ways 

To the other end of transactions like this
There are constant ways

Like this one other end of transactions
with constant ways to the other end

that this is possible
