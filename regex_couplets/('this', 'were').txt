('this', 'were')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
When we had jobs that were to earn

attesting this is a chance
my desires were open

emerging this year from standing water
I argued the days were longer

that I was the arm of this
The days were long

nor work in this way daily
answered about 

A way formerly like this one
I answered what I thought

that this is possible
that they were divisible
