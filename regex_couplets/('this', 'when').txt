('this', 'When')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
When I woke up in the morning

Falling from this distance
When I want something

attesting this is a chance
When they really take hold of my finger

emerging this year from standing water
When closed to my knowing

nor work in this way daily
When I'm watching my tv 

A way formerly like this one
