('this', 'will')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

Falling from this distance
will not be the same

attesting this is a chance
that will spur me on

nor work in this way daily
would only willingly break

A way formerly like this one
my daughter will learn 

that this is possible
