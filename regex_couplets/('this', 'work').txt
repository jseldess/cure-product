('this', 'work')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

Falling from this distance
nor work in this way daily

emerging this year from standing water
Having transitioned from leisure to work

that I was the arm of this
I need the work

attesting this is a chance
nor envy honest work

A way formerly like this one
