('this', 'world')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
off the edge of the world

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Which can be pronounced to the world

attesting this is a chance
off the end of the world

that I was the arm of this
hauling off the end of the world

nor work in this way daily
the opinions in my world

A way formerly like this one
