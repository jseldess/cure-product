('this', 'you.')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Though how can you know without direction

Falling from this distance
You can hear it also through your leisure

attesting this is a chance
If you have confidence regardless all else

nor work in this way daily
May I have your zip code

emerging this year from standing water
That you can see only the back of

that I was the arm of this
since you can imagine movement

A way formerly like this one
the young ripples inaudibly

that this is possible
