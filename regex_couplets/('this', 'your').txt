('this', 'your')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
You can hear it also through your leisure

Falling from this distance
May I have your zip code

emerging this year from standing water
your bid to the next highest ranked network

that I was the arm of this
This is your voice 

nor work in this way daily
This is your choice 

attesting this is a chance
This is your chance

A way formerly like this one
