('through', 'A')

You can hear it also through your leisure
And as an extension of the values

Back up through the results
And make myself a visible

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
All that I can think I want

I cannot clear it also through investiture
A defeated

I get through there
COPY DREAM 

in traversing get through there
As a clone, illegally conceived
