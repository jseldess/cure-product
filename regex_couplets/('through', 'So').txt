('through', 'so')

You can hear it also through your leisure
reasons resources

Back up through the results
or an available resource

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
If I take some different measure

I cannot clear it also through investiture
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
You can clear it also through static seizure

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure

You can clear it also through static siezure
You can hear it also through static leisure

You can clear it also through static leisure
I want to cite a poem so usual

I get through there
Or in some imaginary elsewhere
