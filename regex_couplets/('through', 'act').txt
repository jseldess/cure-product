('through', 'act')

You can hear it also through your leisure
I was enjoined to act again myself

Back up through the results
I was enjoined to act again

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
I refuse indelible tracts

I cannot clear it also through investiture
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Though in not many acts

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in the simple act of reading

Can I clear it through emphatic seizure
though it is not a simple act

You can clear it also through static seizure
The simple act opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
we had inhabited actually
