('through', 'any')

You can hear it also through your leisure
at any time it can drift again

Back up through the results
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
not many face up

I cannot clear it also through investiture
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in not many tracks up in the sky

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I walk up and don’t work anymore

I get through there
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
