('through', 'but')

You can hear it also through your leisure
Attributable or

Back up through the results
but the sun isnâ€™t up

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
but I can hear them

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I resume attributable visions

You can hear it also through static leisure
but where is it

I get through there
attributable visions

I get from here through there
that decisions can be attributable
