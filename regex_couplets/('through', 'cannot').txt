('through', 'cannot')

You can hear it also through your leisure
Then I cannot see face value

Back up through the results
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I cannot clear it also through investiture
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in that I cannot remember
