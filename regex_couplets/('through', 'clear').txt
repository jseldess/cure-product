('through', 'clear')

You can hear it also through your leisure
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I cannot clear it also through investiture
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Can I clear it through emphatic seizure

You can clear it also through static seizure
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
You can clear it also through static siezure

You can hear it also through static leisure
You can clear it also through static leisure

I get through there
