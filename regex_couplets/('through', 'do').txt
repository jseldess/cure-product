('through', 'do')

You can hear it also through your leisure
The dogs and lillies

Back up through the results
which I brought down with qualities

back up through results
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
What I do in my liesure

I cannot clear it also through investiture
I walk up and don’t work anymore

I get through there
here is the site of the battle of maldon
