('through', 'ending')

You can hear it also through your leisure
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I cannot clear it also through investiture
talking into percents bending themselves

I get through there
drawn formerly rights ending themselves
