('through', 'he')

You can hear it also through your leisure
The dogs and lillies

Back up through the results
with my head

back up through results
higher up in the results

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
What was the last time

I cannot clear it also through investiture
up in the television pleasure

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I can hear them between bills and stuff

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in the simple act of reading

Can I clear it through emphatic seizure
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

You can clear it also through static seizure
The simple act opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
You can hear it also through static leisure

You can clear it also through static leisure
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I get through there
in the sense of watching

I get from here through there
I get here through there

in traversing get through there
under the last seen principle

get from here through there
even when close to my knowing
