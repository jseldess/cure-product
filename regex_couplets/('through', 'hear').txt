('through', 'hear')

You can hear it also through your leisure
and my heart rate

Back up through the results
I hear it between bills and stuff

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I cannot clear it also through investiture
but I can hear them

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
You can hear it also through static leisure

You can clear it also through static leisure
as far back as my history heard

I get through there
In my heart did I lose trust
