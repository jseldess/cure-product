('through', 'hold')

You can hear it also through your leisure
I take hold of my finger

Back up through the results
When they really take hold of my finger

back up through results
Since I had to hold the entire company

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
and hold and wish to hold

I get through there
designed to hold up my underwear
