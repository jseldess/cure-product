('through', 'if')

You can hear it also through your leisure
drifting away needs others presume desires

Back up through the results
out of the fifth page ruins

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
If I take a different measure

I cannot clear it also through investiture
If I take some different measure

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
if there is anything
