('through', 'man')

You can hear it also through your leisure
To my children Walt Whitman

Back up through the results
not many face up

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through investiture
in not many tracks up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Though in not many acts

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
that of the man with the dyed blond hair
