('through', 'resume')

You can hear it also through your leisure
and canâ€™t presume to need

Back up through the results
I resume unassimilable visions

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
I resume indelible tracks

I cannot clear it also through investiture
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I resume attributable visions

You can hear it also through static leisure
I continue to presume

I get through there
I presume to others
