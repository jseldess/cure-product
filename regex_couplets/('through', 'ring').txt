('through', 'ring')

You can hear it also through your leisure
bring your child along

Back up through the results
hovering above standing water

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

I get through there
storing in surfeit
