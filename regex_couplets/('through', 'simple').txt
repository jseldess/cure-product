('through', 'simple')

You can hear it also through your leisure
simple black spots

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in the simple act of reading

Can I clear it through emphatic seizure
though it is not a simple act

You can clear it also through static seizure
The simple act opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
