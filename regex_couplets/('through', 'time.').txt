('through', 'time.')

You can hear it also through your leisure
where I sleep at times

Back up through the results
On the timeline I was on

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
The long time I had a vision

I cannot clear it also through investiture
without the long time I was accounting

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
So I constellate the time family country

I get through there
the long time I was on

I get from here through there
or alter of course the time anyway
