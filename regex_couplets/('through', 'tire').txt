('through', 'tire')

You can hear it also through your leisure
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
until I could not tire 

I cannot clear it also through investiture
until I could not be tired

I get through there
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
