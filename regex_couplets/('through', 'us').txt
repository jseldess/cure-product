('through', 'us')

You can hear it also through your leisure
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Back up through the results
remnant continuous pages

back up through results
The ventillation rushes on

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
I refuse indelible tracts

I cannot clear it also through investiture
I want to cite a poem so usual

I get through there
I have them trust in me

I get from here through there
a futile joyous white sun
