('through', 'versing')

You can hear it also through your leisure
in traversing my purchase

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
though as for conversing

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
of my purpose in versing

I get through there
in versing my surfeit

I get from here through there
of my purpose in conversing

in traversing get through there
In conversing of my purpose

I get here through there
in traversing my purpose
