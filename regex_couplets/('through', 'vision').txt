('through', 'vision')

You can hear it also through your leisure
I had me a vision

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
up in the television pleasure

I cannot clear it also through investiture
up in the television

I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
there was no television to hear

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I resume attributable visions

You can hear it also through static leisure
The long time I had a vision

I get through there
attributable visions

I get from here through there
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
