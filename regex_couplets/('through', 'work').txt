('through', 'work')

You can hear it also through your leisure
nor work in this way daily

Back up through the results
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I cannot clear it also through divestiture
I need the work

I cannot clear it also through investiture
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

I get through there
nor envy honest work
