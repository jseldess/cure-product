('time.', 'Thou')

Where I sleep at times
Though there are quarters goals

at any time it can drift again
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

The long time I had a vision
Though in not many acts

without the long time I was accounting
Though we are waiting for her

Or alter of course the time anyway
Though we are breaking 

until a happier time found
Though we are waiting 

formerly a long time they were on
Though we can’t help waiting

formerly along time they were on
