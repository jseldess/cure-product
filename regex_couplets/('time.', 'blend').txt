('time.', 'blend')

Where I sleep at times
battery dawn nights blending themselves

only fragments of time with my children
walking into percents blending themselves

the long time I was on
where I blend and relive

until a happier time found
where lights blended themselves

time they were on
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

formerly along time they were on
