('time.', 'call')

Where I sleep at times
not calling or echoing for once

only fragments of time with my children
though it was most emphatically that

 and time in the train
They are called aspirational

The long time I had a vision
Which can be called confidence

The long time I was a vision
to take the call

until a happier time found
The many transparent pixel calls

formerly along time they were on
recalling aside

in the long time they were on
