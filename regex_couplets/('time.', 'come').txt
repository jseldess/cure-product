('time.', 'come')

Where I sleep at times
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

only fragments of time with my children
Strategy comes before morning

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
and that man comes on to tell me 

formerly along time they were on
and come home to remind inflections
