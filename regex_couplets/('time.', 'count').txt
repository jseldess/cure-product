('time.', 'count')

Where I sleep at times
Then I constellate my time family country

Itâ€™s time to wake up, Papa!
So I constellate the time family country

over the long time up in the sky
I brought my count down

On the timeline I was on
without the long time I was accounting

The long time I had a vision
the simple act of honoring an accountant

The long time I was a vision
without the long time I was on accounting

without accounting the long time I was on
without accounting for credit

which is the long time I was on
More reasons around my country
