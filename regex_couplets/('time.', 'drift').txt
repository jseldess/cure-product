('time.', 'drift')

Where I sleep at times
drifting away

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
drifting does not feel an exception

at any time it can drift again
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Then I constellate my time family country
For whom drifting is not an exception

over the long time up in the sky
drifting away needs

That’s where I sleep at times
drifting away from the task

So I constellate the time family country
