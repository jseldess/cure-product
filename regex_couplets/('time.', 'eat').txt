('time.', 'eat')

Where I sleep at times
too sunny to eat ice cream

only fragments of time with my children
But I can’t let myself treat 

at any time it can drift again
I let myself treat

Then I constellate my time family country
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

That’s where I sleep at times
executive breath

over the long time up in the sky
execute breath

on the time line I was on
was not just a defeat

 and time in the train
Where I put it beating

I spend time online learning to code
of the habits I create

The long time I had a vision
it was not just a defeat

The long time I was a vision
And from that great distance

or alter of course the time anyway
for the creation of the universe

until a happier time found
burrowed about from repeated travels

in the long time they were on
