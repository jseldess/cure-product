('time.', 'else')

Where I sleep at times
If you have confidence regardless all else

 and time in the train
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

or alter of course the time anyway
and elsewhere my memory

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
elsewhere my purposes

until a happier time found
elsewhere by my memory

formerly along time they were on
By my memory elsewhere

in the long time they were on
but for memory elsewhere

time they were on
