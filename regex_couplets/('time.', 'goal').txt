('time.', 'goal')

Where I sleep at times
Though there are quarters goals

at any time it can drift again
and without quartely goals

Then I constellate my time family country
There are quarterly goals

That’s where I sleep at times
before morning goals

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
not goals

The long time I had a vision
What would I feel without that goal

without the long time I was accounting
