('time.', 'know.')

Where I sleep at times
who knows the way

only fragments of time with my children
how can I know without direction

at any time it can drift again
I even know what I would find

The long time I had a vision
even when close to my knowing

or alter of course the time anyway
knowing the constituents

until a happier time found
who knows how to turn it off

formerly along time they were on
that their knowing
