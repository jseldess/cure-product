('time.', 'man')

Where I sleep at times
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

Itâ€™s time to wake up, Papa!
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

at any time it can drift again
To my children Walt Whitman

over the long time up in the sky
There are performance reviews

Then I constellate my time family country
not many face up

The long time I had a vision
though not many facts up in the sky

without the long time I was accounting
in not many tracks up in the sky

So I constellate the time family country
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

or alter of course the time anyway
They have very many choices

until a happier time found
and that man comes on to tell me 

formerly along time they were on
The many transparent pixel calls

time they were on
