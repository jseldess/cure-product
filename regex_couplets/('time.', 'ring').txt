('time.', 'ring')

Where I sleep at times
interferring 

at any time it can drift again
bring your child along

over the long time up in the sky
ring

Then I constellate my time family country
hovering above standing water

On the timeline I was on
actually considering the end

The long time I had a vision
the simple act of honoring an accountant

without the long time I was accounting
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

which is the long time I was on
wearing trying talking into it

without the long time I was on accounting
storing in surfeit

or alter of course the time anyway
firing and connecting somewhere

until a happier time found
The prospect for veering healthily
