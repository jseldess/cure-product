('time.', 'side')

Where I sleep at times
But that is beside the point

Then I constellate my time family country
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
I’m simply inside

only fragments of time with my children
aside from the retinas

The long time I had a vision
actually considering the end

without the long time I was accounting
But my not feeling the memory aside

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

until a happier time found
by the side of the hosting service

formerly along time they were on
But my not feeling the memory inside

time they were on
where I send and relive aside

in the long time they were on
