Where I sleep at times
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

only fragments of time with my children
That’s where I sleep at times

over the long time up in the sky
Interrupted sleep or

 and time in the train
While I should be sleeping

I spend time online learning to code
Looking back while I should be sleeping

On the timeline I was on
like flattening sleep 

without the long time I was accounting
