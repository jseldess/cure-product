('time.', 'story')

Where I sleep at times
I told her a story, she drew waves.

Itâ€™s time to wake up, Papa!
Forecasting the story before dawn

on the time line I was on
as far back as my history heard

The long time I had a vision
You need history

The long time I was a vision
for as far back as my history

without the long time I was accounting
