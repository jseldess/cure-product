('time.', 'too.')

Where I sleep at times
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
too sunny to eat ice cream

only fragments of time with my children
emerging this year from too much standing water

On the timeline I was on
learned without too much difficulty to code

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
Selma knows too 

formerly along time they were on
