('time.', 'up?')

Where I sleep at times
Ask who I am to suspend

Then I constellate my time family country
reasons resources

It’s time to wake up, Papa!
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

only fragments of time with my children
Then fall then summer

at any time it can drift again
as a pure product

over the long time up in the sky
I’ll get there eventually

That’s where I sleep at times
sudden downward turn

So I constellate the time family country
The South Carolina primary 

on the time line I was on
way high up in the internet

over the time line I was on
by no ventillation my purpose

 and time in the train
May I have your zip code

I spend time online learning to code
Spinning around the heart

On the timeline I was on
Then the sun isn’t up 

over the long time I was on
until my purpose up in the sky

Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up
I just got a letter

The long time I had a vision
without the long time I was accounting

The long time I was a vision
until I could not be tired

which is the long time I was on
I resume attributable visions

without the long time I was on accounting
without accounting the long time I was on

the long time I was on
I could in effect credit

in the long time they were on
I have them trust in me

or alter of course the time anyway
Though we are waiting for her

formerly a long time they were on
without really agreeing

cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.
I thought

until a happier time found
without really branding 

formerly along time they were on
I presume to others

time they were on
I assumed what I draw

formerly along the time they were on
about
