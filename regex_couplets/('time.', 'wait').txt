('time.', 'wait')

Where I sleep at times
There are spots waiting

or alter of course the time anyway
Though we are waiting for her

formerly a long time they were on
not needing to wait

until a happier time found
Though we are waiting 

formerly along time they were on
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

time they were on
waiting out front or up above 

in the long time they were on
