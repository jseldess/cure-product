('time.', 'you.')

Where I sleep at times
Though how can you know without direction

at any time it can drift again
bring your child along

over the long time up in the sky
You can hear it also through your leisure

So I constellate the time family country
if you have providence to excess

 and time in the train
May I have your zip code

I spend time online learning to code
That you can see only the back of

The long time I had a vision
where you can earn more 

without the long time I was accounting
If you have confidence regardless all else

The long time I was a vision
a futile joyous white sun

or alter of course the time anyway
This is your voice
