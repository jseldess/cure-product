('tire', 'man')

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
not many face up

until I could not tire 
though not many facts up in the sky

until I could not be tired
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
They have very many choices
