('tire', 'time.')

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
The long time I had a vision

until I could not tire 
without the long time I was accounting

until I could not be tired
So I constellate the time family country

for to tire as far back as my history
The long time I was a vision

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
or alter of course the time anyway
