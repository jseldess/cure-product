('tire', 'up?')

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
And as an extension of the values

The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory
I agrued the days were longer

The entire company
but it continued

Since I had to hold the entire company
I argued the days were longer

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
with full potential to movement

until I could not tire 
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

until I could not be tired
You can hear it also through your leisure

for to tire as far back as my history
you need history

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies
