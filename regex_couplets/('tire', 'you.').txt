('tire', 'you.')

The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory
since you can imagine movement

Since I had to hold the entire crew captive
where you can earn more 

until I could not tire 
You can hear it also through your leisure

until I could not be tired
If you have confidence regardless all else

for to tire as far back as my history
you need history

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
some sort of a futile joyous white sun
