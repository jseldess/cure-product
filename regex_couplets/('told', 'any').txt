('told', 'any')

I told her a story, she drew waves.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

I am told ventillation
Or the company

I am told by no ventillation
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

which ran to be told
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything
