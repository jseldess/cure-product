('told', 'code')

I told her a story, she drew waves.
as long as I have access to the code

I am told ventillation
May I have your zip code

I am told by no ventillation
learned without too much difficulty to code

I am told by the ventillation
Then I am learning to code

So I am told by the ventillation
I am learning to code

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
falling off the encoded end

which ran to be told
zipcode
