('told', 'he')

I told her a story, she drew waves.
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

I am told ventillation
on the time line I was on

I am told by no ventillation
over the long line up in the sky

I am told by the ventillation
Then I am learning to code

So I am told by the ventillation
So that I notice I am the only one

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
The ventillation rushes on

which ran to be told
the opinions in my world

which had on honor to be told
for not paying sound overwhelmed
