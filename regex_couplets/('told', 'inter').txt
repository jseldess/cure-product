('told', 'inter')

I told her a story, she drew waves.
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

I am told ventillation
way high up in the internet

I am told by no ventillation
hold at intervals riding forward

I am told by the ventillation
with internally regulated climate

which ran to be told
my interfaced stand data
