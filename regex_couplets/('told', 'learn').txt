('told', 'learn')

I told her a story, she drew waves.
in light of learning what we see

I am told ventillation
I spend time online learning to code

I am told by no ventillation
learned without too much difficulty to code

I am told by the ventillation
Then I am learning to code

So I am told by the ventillation
I am learning to code

It’s as essential as physics, I’m told
decisioned to learn
