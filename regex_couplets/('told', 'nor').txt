('told', 'nor')

I told her a story, she drew waves.
into the minority proportion of time

I am told ventillation
over the long line I would honor

I am told by no ventillation
nor work in this way daily

I am told by the ventillation
the simple act of honoring an accountant

which ran to be told
which had on honor to be told
