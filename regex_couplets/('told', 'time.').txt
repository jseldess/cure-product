('told', 'time.')

I told her a story, she drew waves.
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

I am told ventillation
on the time line I was on

I am told by no ventillation
over the time line I was on

I am told by the ventillation
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

which ran to be told
until a happier time found
