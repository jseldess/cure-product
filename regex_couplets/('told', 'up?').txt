('told', 'up?')

I told her a story, she drew waves.
because it was really dark

I am told ventillation
way high up in the internet

I am told by no ventillation
over the long line up in the sky

I am told by the ventillation
The ventillation rushes on

which ran to be told
for not paying redundant
