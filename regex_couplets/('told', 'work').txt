('told', 'work')

I told her a story, she drew waves.
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

I am told ventillation
nor work in this way daily

I am told by no ventillation
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I am told by the ventillation
your bid to the next highest ranked network

which ran to be told
