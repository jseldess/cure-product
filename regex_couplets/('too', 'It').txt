('too', 'It')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

too sunny to eat ice cream
It keeps coming down thankfully

emerging this year from too much standing water
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

Selma knows too 
It’s not marshal exactly
