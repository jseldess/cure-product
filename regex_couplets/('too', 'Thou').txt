('too', 'Thou')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Though there are quarters goals

emerging this year from too much standing water
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

Selma knows too 
Though we are waiting for her

Selma helps too
Though we can’t help waiting

My daughter helps too
