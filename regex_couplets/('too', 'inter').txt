('too', 'inter')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

too sunny to eat ice cream
interjecting on a day ambition

emerging this year from too much standing water
high up in the internet

learned without too much difficulty to code
with internally regulated climate

Selma knows too 
my interfaced stand data
