('too', 'now')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
on a snow day with my children

too sunny to eat ice cream
who knows the way

emerging this year from too much standing water
Right now I’m the cart

learned without too much difficulty to code
out in the snow

Selma knows too 
who know the ways to their other end
