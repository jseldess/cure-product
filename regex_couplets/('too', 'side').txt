('too', 'side')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

too sunny to eat ice cream
I’m simply inside

emerging this year from too much standing water
aside from the retinas

Selma knows too 
But my not feeling the memory inside

Selma helps too
By my feeling the memory inside
