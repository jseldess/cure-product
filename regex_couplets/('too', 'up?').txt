('too', 'up?')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

too sunny to eat ice cream
Because it was really dark

emerging this year from too much standing water
to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water

learned without too much difficulty to code
Having transitioned from leisure to work

Selma knows too 
Though we are waiting for her

Selma helps too
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

My daughter helps too
My daughter turns it off too
