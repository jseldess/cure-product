('too.', 'goal')

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.
Though there are quarters goals

emerging this year from too much standing water
before morning goals

learned without too much difficulty to code
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

Selma knows too
