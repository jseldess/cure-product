('track', 'Thou')

I reuse indelible tracks 
Though in not many acts

in not many tracks up in the sky
Though in not many facts

and other types of tracking technology
Though we are waiting for her

which as tracked befitted 
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

which as tracked befitted phased
Though we can’t help waiting

sizes track for asking sound
