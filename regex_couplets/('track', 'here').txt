('track', 'here')

I reuse indelible tracks 
Where I take my liesure

The first track
there was no television to hear

in not many tracks up in the sky
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

and other types of tracking technology
and elsewhere my memory of you

trackers collecting data on users
elsewhere my purposes

which as tracked befitted 
Where in me did I host

which as tracked befitted phased
Is there a baby and a bear

sizes track for asking sound
By my memory elsewhere

sizes asking for tracking sound
The prospects there already
