('track', 'if')

I reuse indelible tracks 
If I take a different measure

The first track
If I take some different measure

I refuse indelible tracks
if there is anything 

and other types of tracking technology
if you have providence

trackers collecting data on users
if that has anything

which as tracked befitted 
if only on the way to the trash
