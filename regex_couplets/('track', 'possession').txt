('track', 'possession')

I reuse indelible tracks 
I speak to them my possessions

which as tracked befitted 
my possession of my children

which as tracked befitted phased
I speak them of my possessions

sizes track for asking sound
speech my possession of my children

sizes asking for tracking sound
I stay the right of my possessions 

between tracked and buffered
Or can have seen offering possession
