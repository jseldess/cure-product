('track', 'static')

I reuse indelible tracks 
wrapped in static and explicit statements

I resume indelible tracks
wrapped in static implicit statements

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

in not many tracks up in the sky
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

and other types of tracking technology
