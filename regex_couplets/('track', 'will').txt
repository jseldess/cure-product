('track', 'will')

I reuse indelible tracks 
will not be the same

The first track
that will spur me on

and other types of tracking technology
would only willingly break

which as tracked befitted 
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

which as tracked befitted phased
my daughter will learn 

sizes track for asking sound
