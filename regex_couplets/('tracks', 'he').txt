('tracks', 'he')

I reuse indelible tracks 
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I refuse indelible tracks
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I resume indelible tracks
What was the last time

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
up in the television

in not many tracks up in the sky
there was no television to hear
