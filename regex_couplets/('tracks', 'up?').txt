('tracks', 'up?')

I reuse indelible tracks 
without the long time I was accounting

I refuse indelible tracks
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I resume indelible tracks
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I resume indelible tracks up in the sky
up in the television

in not many tracks up in the sky
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure
