('transactions', 'A')

to the ends of my transactions
And we could inhabit the room easy

The ends of my transactions
CONTRACT

To the ends of transactions
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR WITH A RUBBY DUCKY)

the other end transactions
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

The other end of transactions like this
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

To the other end of transactions like this
A way I was going

to the other end of transactions
Aligned or not with my interests
