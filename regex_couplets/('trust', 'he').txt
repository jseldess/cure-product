('trust', 'he')

I have them trust in me
in the long time they were on

in the form filled offered in trust
Elsewhere by my memory

about the sight hosting trusting
by the sight of the hosting answered about

in the form filled offered trust
washed by my memory

Where in me did I lose trust
in the form filled offered

In my heart did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

Where did we lose trust
To the ends of transactions
