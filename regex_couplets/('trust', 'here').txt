('trust', 'here')

I have them trust in me
I get through there

in the form filled offered in trust
Elsewhere by my memory

about the sight hosting trusting
Where in me did I loose

in the form filled offered trust
where in me pre-worn

Where in me did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

Where did we lose trust
Is there a baby and a bear
