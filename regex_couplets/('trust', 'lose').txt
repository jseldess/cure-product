('trust', 'lose')

I have them trust in me
even when close to my owning

in the form filled offered in trust
Where in me did I lose

about the sight hosting trusting
Where in me did I lose trust

In my heart did I lose trust
In what part did I lose trust

Where did I lose trust in me
Where did we lose trust
