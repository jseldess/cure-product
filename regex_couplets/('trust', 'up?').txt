('trust', 'up?')

I have them trust in me
in traversing my circuit

in the form filled offered in trust
all parties would be held

about the sight hosting trusting
by the sight of the hosting answered about

in the form filled offered trust
answered about 

Where in me did I lose trust
In my heart did I lose trust

In what part did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

Where did we lose trust
though we are waiting for her
