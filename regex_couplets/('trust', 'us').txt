('trust', 'us')

I have them trust in me
a futile joyous white sun

in the form filled offered in trust
I want to cite a poem so usual

about the sight hosting trusting
in the form filled offered trust

Where in me did I lose trust
In my heart did I lose trust

In what part did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

Where did we lose trust
radiating from housing
