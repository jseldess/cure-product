('trying', 'now')

when trying to feel the extension of key values
I take it out in the snow fall

that I hear without trying
I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking

wearing trying talking into it
even when close to my knowing

I spun around trying to touch the spots
knowing the constituents
