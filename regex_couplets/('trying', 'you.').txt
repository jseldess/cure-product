('trying', 'you.')

when trying to feel the extension of key values
your bid to the next highest ranked network

that I hear without trying
You can hear it also through your leisure

wearing trying talking into it
a futile joyous white sun

I spun around trying to touch the spots
I tell you the weight of my purchases
