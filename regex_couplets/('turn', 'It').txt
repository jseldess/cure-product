('turn', 'It')

in a sharp downward turn 
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

In a sharp downard turn
It keeps coming down thankfully

sudden downward turn
It has been since

I keep turning back again myself
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

who knows how to turn it off
It’s not marshal exactly

I turn not sad exactly
