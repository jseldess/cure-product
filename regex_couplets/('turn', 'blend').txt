('turn', 'blend')

in a sharp downward turn 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

In a sharp downard turn
walking into percents blending themselves

who knows how to turn it off
where lights blended themselves

I turn not sad exactly
dawn formerly rights blended themselves

I return not sad exactly
