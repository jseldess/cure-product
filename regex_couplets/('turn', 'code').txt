('turn', 'code')

in a sharp downward turn 
as long as I have access to the code

sudden downward turn
May I have your zip code

I keep turning back again myself
I spend time online learning to code

I keep turning back
learned without too much difficulty to code

who knows how to turn it off
zipcode

I turn not sad exactly
