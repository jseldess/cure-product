('turn', 'earn')

in a sharp downward turn 
in light of learning what we see

sudden downward turn
When we had jobs that were to earn

I keep turning back again myself
I spend time online learning to code

I keep turning back
learned without too much difficulty to code

who knows how to turn it off
decisioned to learn 

I turn not sad exactly
I learned my location

I returned to location
I learned my point

I returned
decisioned to learn back
