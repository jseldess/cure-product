('turn', 'eat')

in a sharp downward turn 
too sunny to eat ice cream

In a sharp downard turn
I reach repeated expressions first

sudden downward turn
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I keep turning back again myself
Where I put it beating

I keep turning back
executive breath

who knows how to turn it off
for the creation of the universe

I turn not sad exactly
