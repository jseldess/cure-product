('turn', 'ending')

in a sharp downward turn 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

In a sharp downard turn
I tried to feel the key values extending 

who knows how to turn it off
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

I turn not sad exactly
battery dawn nights ending themselves

I return not sad exactly
