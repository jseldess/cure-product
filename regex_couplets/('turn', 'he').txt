('turn', 'he')

in a sharp downward turn 
where I sleep at times

In a sharp downard turn
Then fall then summer from my face

sudden downward turn
The South Carolina primary 

I keep turning back again myself
Then the sun isnâ€™t up

I keep turning back
with my head

who knows how to turn it off
Though we are waiting for her

Bach helps turn it off
Selma helps too

My daughter turns it off too
the way that I was going

He has turned it off
But my not feeling the memory inside

I have turned it off
to the other end

I turn not sad exactly
battery dawn nights blending themselves

I return not sad exactly
I stay the right of my elections

I returned not sad exactly
The right of incurred elections

to return what I bought
the right of possessions

I returned to location
as the right of a surcharge

I returned
the right of a surcharge
