('turn', 'inter')

in a sharp downward turn 
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

In a sharp downard turn
interjecting on a day ambition

sudden downward turn
way high up in the inter

I keep turning back again myself
hold at intervals riding forward

I keep turning back
at intervals while riding forward

who knows how to turn it off
my interfaced stand data

I turn not sad exactly
I interfaced

I return not sad exactly
Aligned or not with my interests

I returned not sad exactly
The right of interned elections

to return what I bought
