('turn', 'know.')

in a sharp downward turn 
who knows the way

In a sharp downard turn
how can I know without direction

sudden downward turn
I even know what I would find

who knows how to turn it off
Selma knows too 

Bach helps turn it off
who know the ways to their other end

I turn not sad exactly
that their knowing
