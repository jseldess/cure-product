('turn', 'now')

in a sharp downward turn 
On a snow day with my children

In a sharp downard turn
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

sudden downward turn
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

I keep turning back again myself
out in the snow

who knows how to turn it off
Selma knows too 

Bach helps turn it off
who knows the way

I turn not sad exactly
that their knowing
