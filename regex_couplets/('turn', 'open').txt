('turn', 'open')

in a sharp downward turn 
Before we walk across the wide opening

In a sharp downard turn
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

sudden downward turn
my desires were open

I keep turning back
I wish my desires were open

I keep turning back again myself
The simple act opening surmounted

who knows how to turn it off
