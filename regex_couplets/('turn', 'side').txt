('turn', 'side')

in a sharp downward turn 
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

In a sharp downard turn
I’m simply inside

sudden downward turn
aside from the retinas

who knows how to turn it off
But my not feeling the memory inside

Bach helps turn it off
By my feeling the memory inside

I turn not sad exactly
