('turn', 'stay')

in a sharp downward turn 
wrestling to stay still

sudden downward turn
So stay with us

who knows how to turn it off
own stays brought loyal

I turn not sad exactly
I stay the right of my elections

I return not sad exactly
stay to my elections

I returned not sad exactly
home stays brought loyal
