('turn', 'time.')

in a sharp downward turn 
where I sleep at times

In a sharp downard turn
only fragments of time with my children

sudden downward turn
over the long time up in the sky

I keep turning back again myself
I spend time online learning to code

I keep turning back
On the timeline I was on

who knows how to turn it off
formerly along time they were on

I turn not sad exactly
in the long time they were on

I return not sad exactly
