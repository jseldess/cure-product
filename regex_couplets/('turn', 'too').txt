('turn', 'too')

in a sharp downward turn 
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

In a sharp downard turn
emerging this year from too much standing water

who knows how to turn it off
Selma knows too 

Bach helps turn it off
Selma helps too

My daughter turns it off too
