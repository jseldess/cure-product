('turn', 'up?')

in a sharp downward turn 
an impure product

In a sharp downard turn
Then fall then summer from my face

sudden downward turn
The South Carolina primary 

I keep turning back again myself
Then the sun isnâ€™t up

I keep turning back
While I should be sleeping

who knows how to turn it off
Though we are waiting for her

Bach helps turn it off
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

My daughter turns it off too
He has turned it off

I have turned it off
I end up Bach

I turn not sad exactly
not literally moved about

I return not sad exactly
which I feel formerly about for

I returned not sad exactly
The right of incurred elections

to return what I bought
behind or out front or up above

I returned to location
as the right of a surcharge

I returned
the right of a surcharge
