('turn', 'us')

in a sharp downward turn 
asynchronous 

In a sharp downard turn
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

sudden downward turn
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I keep turning back again myself
In a vertiginous dream

I keep turning back
in a continuous vertiginous dream

who knows how to turn it off
radiating from housing

I return not sad exactly
I have them trust in me

I returned
