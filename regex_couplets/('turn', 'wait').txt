('turn', 'wait')

in a sharp downward turn 
There are spots waiting

who knows how to turn it off
Though we are waiting for her

Bach helps turn it off
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

My daughter turns it off too
not needing to wait

I turn not sad exactly
waiting out front or up above 

I returned not sad exactly
waiting out front or up above or behind

I returned to location
