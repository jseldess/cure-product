('until', 'A')

until my purpose up in the sky
After having been contented

until I could not tire 
A defeated

until I could not be tired
COPY DREAM 

until I purpose up in the sky
And reached up the screen

until I purchase up the sky
And from that great distance

until I purchase the sky
And from a great distance

until the bill came
As a clone, illegally conceived

until a happier time found
CONTRACT
