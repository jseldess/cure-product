('until', 'while')

until my purpose up in the sky
Looking back while I should be sleeping

until I could not tire 
while wrapped in static

until I could not be tired
while wrapped in explicit static

until I could not be hired
while consuming damage

until I purchase up the sky
I answered while interfaced
