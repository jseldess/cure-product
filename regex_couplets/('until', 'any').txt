('until', 'any')

until my purpose up in the sky
Or the company

until I could not tire 
though not many facts up in the sky

until I could not be tired
I walk up and don’t work anymore

until I could not be hired
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

until I purpose up in the sky
there wasn’t any television 

until I purchase up the sky
without any further damage

until the bill came
without any longer damage

until a happier time found
latency which doesn’t mean anything
