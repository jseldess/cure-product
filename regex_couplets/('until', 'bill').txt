('until', 'bill')

until my purpose up in the sky
I hear it between bills and stuff

until I could not tire 
I can hear them between bills and stuff

until I could not be tired
billowing in the cloud

until I purpose up in the sky
until the bill came

until a happier time found
the bill my detuning
