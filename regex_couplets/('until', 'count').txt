('until', 'count')

until my purpose up in the sky
So I constellate the time family country

until I could not tire 
without the long time I was accounting

until I could not be tired
around my country 

until I could not be hired
without the long time I was on accounting

until I purpose up in the sky
More reasons around my country 

until a happier time found
