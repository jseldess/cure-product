('until', 'do')

until my purpose up in the sky
The dogs and lillies

until I could not tire 
What I do in my liesure

until I could not be tired
I walk up and don’t work anymore

until I could not be hired
here is the site of the battle of maldon

until I purpose up in the sky
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

until I purchase up the sky
around the dogs and lillies

until I purchase the sky
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

until the bill came
and it doesn’t take long

until a happier time found
latency which doesn’t mean anything
