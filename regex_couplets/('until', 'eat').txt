('until', 'eat')

until my purpose up in the sky
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

until I could not tire 
it was not just a defeat

until I could not be tired
And from that great distance

until I purchase up the sky
And from a great distance

until I purchase the sky
was not just a defeat

until a happier time found
for the creation of the universe
