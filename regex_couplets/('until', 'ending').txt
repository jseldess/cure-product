('until', 'ending')

until my purpose up in the sky
I tried to feel the key values extending 

until I could not tire 
talking into pheasants bending themselves

until I could not be tired
talking into percents bending themselves

until I purpose up in the sky
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

until a happier time found
battery dawn nights blending themselves
