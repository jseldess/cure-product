('until', 'gravity')

until my purpose up in the sky
and testing the edge and gravity

until I could not tire 
where I need gravity

until I purpose up in the sky
Where I lead gravity

until I purchase up the sky
I tell you where I need gravity

until the bill came
My means without gravity

until a happier time found
