('until', 'has')

until my purpose up in the sky
It has been since

until I could not tire 
in traversing my purchase

until I could not be tired
purchased out

until I purpose up in the sky
my purchase up in the sky

until I purchase up in the sky
I tell you the weight of my purchases

until I purchase up the sky
until I purchase the sky

until my purchase up in the sky
Is the weight of my purchases

until the bill came
if that has anything

until a happier time found
phase decisioned by the prospect
