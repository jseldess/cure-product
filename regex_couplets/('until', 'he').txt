('until', 'he')

until my purpose up in the sky
Then I cannot see face value

until I could not tire 
What was the last time

until I could not be tired
as far back as my history heard

until I could not be hired
until I purpose the horizon

until I purpose up in the sky
While weâ€™re up in the sky

until I purchase up in the sky
My purpose up in the sky

until I purchase up the sky
around the dogs and lillies

until I purchase the sky
my purchase up in the sky

until my purchase up in the sky
my purchse up in the sky

until the bill came
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

until a happier time found
the resemblance
