('until', 'here')

until my purpose up in the sky
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

until I could not tire 
there was no television to hear

until I could not be tired
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

until I could not be hired
I get through there

until I purpose up in the sky
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

until I purchase up the sky
where I need gravity

until I purchase the sky
There are spots waiting

until I purchase up in the sky
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

until the bill came
here is the site of the battle of maldon

until a happier time found
Where in me did I host
