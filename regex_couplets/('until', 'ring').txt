('until', 'ring')

until my purpose up in the sky
ring

until I could not tire 
the simple act of honoring an accountant

until I could not be tired
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

until I purpose up in the sky
firing and connecting somewhere

until a happier time found
The prospect for veering healthily
