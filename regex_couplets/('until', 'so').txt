('until', 'so')

until my purpose up in the sky
reasons resources

until I could not tire 
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

until I could not be tired
You can hear it also through your leisure

until I could not be hired
If I take some different measure

until I purpose up in the sky
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

until I purchase up the sky
so that nothing had gravity

until the bill came
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

until a happier time found
so still watch them
