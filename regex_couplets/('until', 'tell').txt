('until', 'tell')

until my purpose up in the sky
So I constellate the time family country

until I could not tire 
I tell you my purposes

until I purpose up in the sky
I tell you the weight of my purchases

until I purchase up the sky
I tell you the weight of my purposes

until the bill came
and that man comes on to tell me
