('until', 'time.')

until my purpose up in the sky
over the time line I was on

until I could not tire 
The long time I had a vision

until I could not be tired
without the long time I was accounting

until I could not be hired
which is the long time I was on

until I purpose up in the sky
or alter of course the time anyway

until a happier time found
formerly a long time they were on
