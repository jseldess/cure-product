('until', 'up?')

until my purpose up in the sky
Then I cannot see face value

until I could not tire 
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

until I could not be tired
You can hear it also through your leisure

until I could not be hired
until I purpose the horizon

until I purpose up in the sky
While weâ€™re up in the sky

until I purchase up in the sky
My purpose up in the sky

until I purchase up the sky
around the dogs and lillies

until I purchase the sky
I spin around 

until my purchase up in the sky
my purchse up in the sky

until the bill came
My means without gravity

until a happier time found
without really branding
