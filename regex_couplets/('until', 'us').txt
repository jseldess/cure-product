('until', 'us')

until my purpose up in the sky
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

until I could not tire 
I want to cite a poem so usual

until I could not be tired
I have them trust in me

until I purpose up in the sky
I wear suspenders

until I purchase up the sky
suspenders

until I purchase the sky
a futile joyous white sun

until a happier time found
useless for not having paid
