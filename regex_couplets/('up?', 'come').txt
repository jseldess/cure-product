('up?', 'come')

Ask who I am to suspend
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
Strategy comes before morning

Then the sun isn’t up
after having been contented Strategy comes before morning

I get up soon and talk in front imaged
Its strategy comes before morning goals

but the sun isn’t up
Strategy comes before goals

barely outlines
and that man comes on to tell me 

Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
and come home to remind inflections

and could be inflected with reasons
