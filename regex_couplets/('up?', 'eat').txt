('up?', 'eat')

Ask who I am to suspend
too sunny to eat ice cream

Because it was really dark
I reach repeated expressions first

The sun isn’t up 
I propogated repeated expressions first

such as I see
skin smile repeated expressions

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
But I can’t let myself treat 

as a pure product
Then I can’t presume to treat others

and is relentlessly budgeted
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

But in more 
I let myself treat

Then I constellate my time family country
executive breath

execute breath
was not just a defeat

Blue sky or
Where I put it beating

Out of the remnants 
of the habits I create

upsent in the afternoon
of the habits they create

I can see only the back of their economic value
they create

increasingly that their economic value
of the habits they create.

your bid to the next highest ranked network
That company creates a life

So stay with us
it was not just a defeat

though it was most emphatically that
A defeated

around my country 
And from that great distance

around the dogs and lillies
And from a great distance

While we’re up in the sky
for the creation of the universe

for the duration of the universe
burrowed about from repeated travels

answered about 
from cables reheated travels

the duration of answers
deep into pathways from repeated travels

But my not feeling the memory aside
