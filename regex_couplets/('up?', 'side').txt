('up?', 'side')

Ask who I am to suspend
But that is beside the point

I am to end my connections suspended live
Whereas direction is beside the point

I suspend my connections to you
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.
I’m simply inside

The sun isn’t up 
aside from the retinas

I argued that the days were longer
actually considering the end

I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking
But my not feeling the memory aside

I stand and retrieve the impulse
where I send and relive aside

I send and retrieve aside the impulse
where I send and retrieve aside

the impulse for my own purposes
where I stand aside

the impulse to my purpose
aside the impulse to my purpose

Where I host my purposes
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

I stand and retrieve the impuse
But my not feeling the memory inside

I stand and retrieve the impulse around
where I stand aside and retrieve

between the drug store and the 
where I am aside at least

for the duration of the answer
where I am aside

the duration of answers
by the side of the hosting service

answered about 
By my feeling the memory inside

Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
44 seconds inside

and end up in Bach
But my feeling the memory aside

the least productive of myself
recalling aside

Selma’s squirrel and chickadee
