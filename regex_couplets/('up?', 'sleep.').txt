Ask who I am to suspend
Where I sleep at times

I am to end my connections suspended live
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

Looking back while I should be sleeping

While I should sleep not back in the results

Remnant continuous pages
like flattening sleep 

I resume attributable visions
