('up?', 'story')

Ask who I am to suspend
I told her a story, she drew waves.

because it was really dark
Forecasting the story before dawn

The sun shielding 
as far back as my history heard

I reuse indelible tracks
You need history

until I could not be tired
for to tire as far back as my history

until I could not be hired
for as far back as my history

until I purpose the horizon
