('up?', 'wait')

Ask who I am to suspend
There are spots waiting

until I purchase up in the sky
Though we are waiting for her

I thought
not needing to wait

and relive from burrowed travels
Though we are waiting 

all parties would be held
Though we can’t help waiting

Though we can’t help waiting for her
waiting out front or up above 

I returned not sad exactly
waiting out front or up above or behind

in the fill space out front
