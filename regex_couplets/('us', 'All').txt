('us', 'All')

Ask who I am to suspend
All of the time

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
All that I can think I want

I want to cite a poem so usual
All parties would be held for my own purchases

in the form filled offered in trust
All parties would be held

useless for not having paid
All that I own messageable
