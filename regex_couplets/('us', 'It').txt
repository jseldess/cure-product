('us', 'It')

Ask who I am to suspend
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

asynchronous 
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
It keeps coming down thankfully

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
It has been since

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

The ventillation rushes on
It’s morning 

I just got a letter
It’s the third letter from the end

So stay with us
It’s not marshal exactly

radiating from housing
