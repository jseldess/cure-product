('us', 'Thou')

Ask who I am to suspend
Though there are quarters goals

They’re just not mine
Though how can you know without direction

slow asynchronous
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I reuse indelible tracks 
Though in not many acts

I want to cite a poem so usual
Though we are waiting for her

in the form filled offered in trust
Though we are breaking 

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
Though we are waiting 

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
Though we can’t help waiting

radiating from housing
