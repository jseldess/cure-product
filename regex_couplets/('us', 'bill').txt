('us', 'bill')

Ask who I am to suspend
between bills and stuffed animals

asynchronous 
I hear it between bills and stuff

The ventillation rushes on
I can hear it between bills and stuff

I reuse unassimilable visions
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I reuse indelible tracks 
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

I want to cite a poem so usual
billowing in the cloud

I have them trust in me
until the bill came

a futile joyous white sun
the bill my detuning
