('us', 'blend')

Ask who I am to suspend
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
walking into percents blending themselves

I have them trust in me
where I blend and relive

useless for not having paid
where lights blended themselves

radiating from housing
dawn formerly rights blended themselves
