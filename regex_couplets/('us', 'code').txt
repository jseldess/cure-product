('us', 'code')

Ask who I am to suspend
as long as I have access to the code

Theyâ€™re just not mine
May I have your zip code

In a vertiginous dream
I spend time online learning to code

You use the most essential parts
learned without too much difficulty to code

The ventillation rushes on
falling off the encoded end

I reuse unassimilable visions
encoded off the end

I reuse indelible tracks
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

a futile joyous white sun
zipcode

radiating from housing
