('us', 'count')

Ask who I am to suspend
Then I constellate my time family country

asynchronous 
So I constellate the time family country

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I brought my count down

in a continuous vertiginous dream
without the long time I was accounting

because there was no solid ground to continue along
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I want to cite a poem so usual
around my country 

I have them trust in me
More reasons around my country
