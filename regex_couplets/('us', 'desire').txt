('us', 'desire')

Ask who I am to suspend
others desires

slow asynchronous
If I let myself see others desires

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
drifting away needs others presume desires

I want to cite a poem so usual
my desires were open

You use the most essential parts
I wish my desires were open

in a continuous vertiginous dream
a similar desire against me

Remnant continuous pages
