('us', 'earn')

Ask who I am to suspend
in light of learning what we see

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
When we had jobs that were to earn

was not just a defeat
I spend time online learning to code

You use the most essential parts
learned without too much difficulty to code

The ventillation rushes on
where you can earn more 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
decisioned to learn 

in the form filled offered in trust
decisioned to learn back

radiating from housing
I learned my location

I have them trust in me
I learned my point
