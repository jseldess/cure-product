('us', 'eat')

Ask who I am to suspend
too sunny to eat ice cream

Because it was really dark
I reach repeated expressions first

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
I let myself treat

I want to cite a poem so usual
was not just a defeat

In a vertiginous dream
Where I put it beating

You use the most essential parts
executive breath

The ventillation rushes on
of the habits I create

So stay with us
That company creates a life

but it continued rippling muscle
it was not just a defeat

I have them trust in me
And from that great distance

I used my technology
And from a great distance

a futile joyous white sun
for the creation of the universe

useless for not having paid
burrowed about from repeated travels

radiating from housing
