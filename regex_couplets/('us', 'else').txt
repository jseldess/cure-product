('us', 'else')

Ask who I am to suspend
If you have confidence regardless all else

was not just a defeat
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I wear suspenders
and elsewhere my memory

trackers collecting data on users
elsewhere my purposes

in the form filled offered in trust
elsewhere by my memory

in the form filled offered trust
By my memory elsewhere

in the form filled offered must
in memory elsewhere

radiating from housing
but for memory elsewhere

I have them trust in me
