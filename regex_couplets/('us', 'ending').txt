('us', 'ending')

Ask who I am to suspend
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
I tried to feel the key values extending 

So stay with us
talking into pheasants bending themselves

because there was no solid ground to continue along
talking into percents bending themselves

I have them trust in me
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

useless for not having paid
battery dawn nights ending themselves

radiating from housing
