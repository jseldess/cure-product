('us', 'enter')

Ask who I am to suspend
I have entered my phone

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
The sun high enough to enter directly 

it was not just a defeat
I enter the flattening mirror

I have them trust in me
I have entered my purposes

trackers collecting data on users
entered into my purposes

data collection on users
I had entered my phone

radiating from housing
