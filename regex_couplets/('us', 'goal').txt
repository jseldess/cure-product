('us', 'goal')

Ask who I am to suspend
Though there are quarters goals

Theyâ€™re just not mine
We can wrestle them with their goals

slow asynchronous
and without quartely goals

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
before morning goals

The ventillation rushes on
Before chores morning goals Strategy comes before morning goals

I just got a letter
not goals

So stay with us
What would I feel without that goal

because there was no solid ground to continue along
