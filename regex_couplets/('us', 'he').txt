('us', 'he')

Ask who I am to suspend
But that is beside the point

I am to end my connections suspended live
Where I sleep at times

I suspend live connections to you
Whereas direction is beside the point

I suspend my connections to you
The dogs and lillies

Suspended live in connections to you
I step off the edge

asynchronous 
Before we walk across the wide field

because it was really dark
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
Of course there is a direction

They’re just not mine
Actually one day there is direction

russling to stay still
I can’t fix them without direction

slow asynchronous
others desires

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
here described

I want to cite a poem so usual
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

was not just a defeat
 and time in the train

In a vertiginous dream
Then the sun isn’t up

in a continuous vertiginous dream
and my heart rate

You use the most essential parts
Even before the lesson starts

In a continuous theme
I put my head down

Remnant continuous pages
Back in the results pages

The ventillation rushes on
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

I just got a letter
It’s the third letter from the end

So stay with us
And as an extension of the values

but it continued rippling muscle
The days were long aligned

I reuse unassimilable visions
talking into pheasants bending themselves

because there was no solid ground to continue along
walking along the measure

I reuse indelible tracks 
The long time I had a vision

I refuse indelible tracts
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I refuse indelible contracts
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

it was not just a defeat
advancing the time

I have them trust in me
in the long time they were on

a futile joyous white sun
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses

Articles all around us
Under the last principle of purchasing power

I wear suspenders
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I used my technology
I continued to dream then

suspenders
where I need gravity

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

in the form filled offered in trust
Elsewhere by my memory

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
Where I send and relive aside

I stand and retrieve the impuse
All parties would be held

useless for not having paid
the 

uses for the attention of the brand
to the suggestion

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
Where in me did I host

about the sight hosting trusting
by the sight of the hosting answered about

in the form filled offered trust
washed by my memory

in the form filled offered must
pre-worn and still wash them

Where in me did I lose trust
in the form filled offered

In my heart did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

Where did we lose trust
To the ends of transactions

radiating from housing
shone from the housing
