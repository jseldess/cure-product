('us', 'inter')

Ask who I am to suspend
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Because it was really dark
interjecting on a day ambition

Theyâ€™re just not mine
way high up in the inter

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
hold at intervals riding forward

in a continuous vertiginous dream
at intervals while riding forward

In a continuous theme
high up in the internet

The ventillation rushes on
with internally regulated climate

So stay with us
Then I saw them interview

I have them trust in me
my interfaced stand data

radiating from housing
I interfaced
