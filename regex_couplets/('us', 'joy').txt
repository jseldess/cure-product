('us', 'joy')

Ask who I am to suspend
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

Because it was really dark
I was enjoying acting against myself

So stay with us
a futile joyous white sun

Articles all around us
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
