('us', 'keep')

Ask who I am to suspend
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
It keeps coming down thankfully

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
I keep turning back again myself

In a vertiginous dream
I keep turning back

in a continuous vertiginous dream
