('us', 'know.')

Ask who I am to suspend
who knows the way

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
how can I know without direction

russling to stay still
Though how can you know without direction

Theyâ€™re just not mine
for how can you know without direction

slow asynchronous
I even know what I would find

I refuse indelible tracts
even when close to my knowing

a futile joyous white sun
knowing the constituents

useless for not having paid
who knows how to turn it off

radiating from housing
that their knowing

I have them trust in me
