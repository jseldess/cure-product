('us', 'lose')

Ask who I am to suspend
even when close to my owning

a futile joyous white sun
Where in me did I lose

in the form filled offered in trust
Where in me did I lose trust

In my heart did I lose trust
In what part did I lose trust

Where did I lose trust in me
Where did we lose trust

radiating from housing
