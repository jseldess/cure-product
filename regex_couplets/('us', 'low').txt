('us', 'low')

Ask who I am to suspend
slow

asynchronous 
slow asynchronous

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
to the pillow

I want to cite a poem so usual
low in the content architecture

You use the most essential parts
Out of the back page ruins low in the content architecture

The ventillation rushes on
I am not allowed to see their face

So stay with us
under pillowing a cloud

I have them trust in me
