('us', 'man')

Ask who I am to suspend
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

because it was really dark
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

slow asynchronous
To my children Walt Whitman

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
not many face up

I want to cite a poem so usual
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
They have very many choices

The trackers on users
and that man comes on to tell me 

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
The many transparent pixel calls

radiating from housing
