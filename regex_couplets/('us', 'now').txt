('us', 'now')

Ask who I am to suspend
On a snow day with my children

asynchronous 
who knows the way

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

They’re just not mine
how can I know without direction

russling to stay still
Though how can you know without direction

slow asynchronous
Right now I’m the cart

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
out in the snow

I want to cite a poem so usual
out in the snow fall

So stay with us
I take it out in the snow fall

because there was no solid ground to continue along
I even know what I would find

I refuse indelible tracts
even when close to my knowing

a futile joyous white sun
knowing the constituents

useless for not having paid
who knows how to turn it off

radiating from housing
that their knowing

I have them trust in me
