('us', 'open')

Ask who I am to suspend
Before we walk across the wide opening

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
Before anyone walks across the opening

Theyâ€™re just not mine
my desires were open

You use the most essential parts
I wish my desires were open

in a continuous vertiginous dream
The simple act opening surmounted

I want to cite a poem so usual
