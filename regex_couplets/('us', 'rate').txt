('us', 'rate')

Ask who I am to suspend
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
and my heart rate

In a vertiginous dream
and my heartrate

You use the most essential parts
Strategy comes before morning

I just got a letter
and strategies not tactics

So stay with us
I aspirate with little vision

but it continued rippling muscle
