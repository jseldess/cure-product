('us', 'than')

Ask who I am to suspend
It keeps coming down thankfully

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
than in the incoming stream

Theyâ€™re just not mine
than solid ground

because there was no solid ground to continue along
Having seen more than 

in the form filled offered in trust
Having seen more than I can remember
