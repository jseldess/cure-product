('us', 'time.')

Ask who I am to suspend
Where I sleep at times

I am to end my connections suspended live
Then I constellate my time family country

asynchronous 
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

because it was really dark
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
only fragments of time with my children

They’re just not mine
at any time it can drift again

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
That’s where I sleep at times

I want to cite a poem so usual
So I constellate the time family country

was not just a defeat
 and time in the train

In a vertiginous dream
I spend time online learning to code

You use the most essential parts
On the timeline I was on

The ventillation rushes on
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

I just got a letter
The long time I had a vision

because there was no solid ground to continue along
without the long time I was accounting

I reuse indelible tracks 
The long time I was a vision

I have them trust in me
in the long time they were on

a futile joyous white sun
or alter of course the time anyway

in the form filled offered in trust
formerly a long time they were on

useless for not having paid
formerly along time they were on

radiating from housing
time they were on
