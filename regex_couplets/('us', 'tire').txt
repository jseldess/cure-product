('us', 'tire')

Ask who I am to suspend
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

So stay with us
until I could not tire 

I want to cite a poem so usual
for to tire as far back as my history

I have them trust in me
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
