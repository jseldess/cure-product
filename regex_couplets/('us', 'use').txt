('us', 'use')

Ask who I am to suspend
because it was really dark

A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 
You use the most essential parts

in a continuous vertiginous dream
I reuse unassimilable visions

because there was no solid ground to continue along
I reuse indelible tracks 

I refuse indelible tracts
I refuse indelible tracks

I refuse indelible contracts
I used my technology

I wear suspenders
trackers collecting data on users

data collection on users
The trackers on users

"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

I stand and retrieve the impuse
useless for not having paid

uses for the attention of the brand
