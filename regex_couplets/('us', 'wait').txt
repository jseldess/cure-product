('us', 'wait')

Ask who I am to suspend
There are spots waiting

a futile joyous white sun
Though we are waiting for her

in the form filled offered in trust
not needing to wait

useless for not having paid
Though we are waiting 

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

radiating from housing
waiting out front or up above 

I have them trust in me
