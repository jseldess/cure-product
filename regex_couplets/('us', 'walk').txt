('us', 'walk')

Ask who I am to suspend
Before we walk across the wide field

asynchronous 
Before we walk across the wide opening

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
Before anyone walks across the opening

They’re just not mine
there was no walking along the pleasure

because there was no solid ground to continue along
walking along the measure

I reuse indelible tracks 
I walk up and don’t work anymore

it was not just a defeat
walking into percents blending themselves

I have them trust in me
