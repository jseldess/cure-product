('us', 'wash')

Ask who I am to suspend
washed by my memory

I want to cite a poem so usual
washed my memory

The trackers on users
washed my purchases

in the form filled offered in trust
still wash conserving

in the form filled offered trust
washed

in the form filled offered must
pre-worn and still wash them

Where in me did I lose trust
