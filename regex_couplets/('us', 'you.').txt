('us', 'you.')

Ask who I am to suspend
Though how can you know without direction

Theyâ€™re just not mine
for how can you know without direction

slow asynchronous
You can hear it also through your leisure

was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney
if you have providence to excess

I want to cite a poem so usual
If you have confidence regardless all else

was not just a defeat
May I have your zip code

In a vertiginous dream
That you can see only the back of

So stay with us
since you can imagine movement

but it continued rippling muscle
where you can earn more 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
you need history

I have them trust in me
a futile joyous white sun

Articles all around us
I tell you my purposes

I wear suspenders
I tell you the weight of my purchases

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

in the form filled offered in trust
This is your voice
