('use', 'Thou')

because it was really dark
Though there are quarters goals

You use the most essential parts
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

I reuse indelible tracks 
Though in not many acts

I used my technology
Though we are waiting for her

trackers collecting data on users
Though we are breaking 

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
Though we are waiting
