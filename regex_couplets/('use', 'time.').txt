('use', 'time.')

because it was really dark
Itâ€™s time to wake up, Papa!

You use the most essential parts
On the timeline I was on

I reuse unassimilable visions
The long time I had a vision

because there was no solid ground to continue along
without the long time I was accounting

I reuse indelible tracks 
So I constellate the time family country

I used my technology
or alter of course the time anyway
