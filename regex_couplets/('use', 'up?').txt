('use', 'up?')

because it was really dark
Itâ€™s time to wake up, Papa!

You use the most essential parts
Even before the skills aquired

I reuse unassimilable visions
without the long time I was accounting

because there was no solid ground to continue along
walking along the measure

I reuse indelible tracks 
Where I take my liesure

I refuse indelible tracts
I refuse indelible tracks

I refuse indelible contracts
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I used my technology
I continued to dream then

The trackers on users
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

I send and retrieve aside the impuse
I stand and retrieve the impuse

useless for not having paid
without really binding myself

uses for the attention of the brand
to the suggestion
