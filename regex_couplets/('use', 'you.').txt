('use', 'you.')

because it was really dark
Though how can you know without direction

You use the most essential parts
That you can see only the back of

I reuse unassimilable visions
where you can earn more 

because there was no solid ground to continue along
You can hear it also through your leisure

I used my technology
I tell you my purposes

trackers collecting data on users
the young ripples inaudibly
