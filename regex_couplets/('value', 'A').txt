('value', 'A')

Then I cannot see face value
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

value falling off the edge of the face
All of the time

And as an extension of the values
BREAK

The value falling off the edge of the face
And make myself a visible

The CEO tells me to embody values
After having been contented

I see only the back of falling values
ASPIRATING

of my economic value
Aspirational strategy

I can see only the back of falling values
ASPIRATING VISIONS

and key value
As an extension of the values
