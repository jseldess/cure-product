('value', 'so')

Then I cannot see face value
Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type

value falling off the edge of the face
When I want something

And as an extension of the values
soft paper

The value falling off the edge of the face
reasons resources

The CEO tells me to embody values
dislocated and a person from a distance

The value falling off the edge of th face
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

I see only the back of falling values
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

and key value
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

As an extension of the values
embodied with little reason
