('value', 'That')

Then I cannot see face value
That’s exaclty what I want for them

value falling off the edge of the face
That’s where I sleep at times

The value falling off the edge of the face
That’s when they really take

And as an extension of the values
That you can see only the back of

then I can see only the back values
That can’t be glimpsed

their economic value
That company creates a life

As an extension of the values
That I captured an afterimage
