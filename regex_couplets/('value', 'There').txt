('value', 'There')

Then I cannot see face value
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

value falling off the edge of the face
There are quarterly goals

And as an extension of the values
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

The CEO tells me to embody values
There was very little physical activity

As an extension of the values
There are spots waiting
