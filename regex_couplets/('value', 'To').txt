('value', 'To')

Then I cannot see face value
To my children Walt Whitman

value falling off the edge of the face
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

The CEO tells me to embody values
To that impossible place

And as an extension of the values
Tomorrow

I see only the back of falling values
Toward the start informally given my reasons
