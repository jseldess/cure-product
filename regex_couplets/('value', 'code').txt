('value', 'code')

Then I cannot see face value
as long as I have access to the code

value falling off the edge of the face
May I have your zip code

The CEO tells me to embody values
I spend time online learning to code

And as an extension of the values
learned without too much difficulty to code

I see only the back of falling values
falling off the encoded end
