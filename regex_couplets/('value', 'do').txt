('value', 'do')

Then I cannot see face value
in a sharp downward turn 

value falling off the edge of the face
In a sharp downard turn

And as an extension of the values
to the down arrow

The value falling off the edge of the face
The dogs and lillies

The CEO tells me to embody values
which I brought down with qualities

The value falling off the edge of th face
So that I donâ€™t notice I am the only one

I see only the back of falling values
What I do in my liesure
