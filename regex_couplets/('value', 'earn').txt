('value', 'earn')

Then I cannot see face value
in light of learning what we see

value falling off the edge of the face
When we had jobs that were to earn

The CEO tells me to embody values
I spend time online learning to code

And as an extension of the values
learned without too much difficulty to code

I see only the back of falling values
where you can earn more
