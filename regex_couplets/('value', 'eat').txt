('value', 'eat')

Then I cannot see face value
too sunny to eat ice cream

value falling off the edge of the face
I reach repeated expressions first

And as an extension of the values
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

The value falling off the edge of the face
executive breath

The CEO tells me to embody values
Where I put it beating

The value falling off the edge of th face
of the habits I create

I see the back of falling values
of the habits they create

I can see only the back of their economic value
they create

increasingly that their economic value
of the habits they create.

and key value
That company creates a life

As an extension of the values
it was not just a defeat
