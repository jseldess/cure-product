('value', 'here')

Then I cannot see face value
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

value falling off the edge of the face
Of course there is a direction

And as an extension of the values
here described

The value falling off the edge of the face
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

The CEO tells me to embody values
Where I put it beating

The value falling off the edge of th face
there was no promotion

and key value
There was very little physical activity

As an extension of the values
that potential is there for you
