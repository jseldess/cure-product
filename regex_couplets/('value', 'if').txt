('value', 'if')

Then I cannot see face value
drifting away

value falling off the edge of the face
if not directly on my skin

And as an extension of the values
drifting away needs others presume desires

The value falling off the edge of the face
if you have providence to excess

The CEO tells me to embody values
out of the fifth page ruins

The value falling off the edge of th face
learned without too much difficulty to code

I see only the back of falling values
That company creates a life

As an extension of the values
Life is with people
