('value', 'plan')

Then I cannot see face value
and is relentlessly planned

value falling off the edge of the face
The planning process for visions

of my economic value
I see the back of the planning process

I see the back of falling values
The planning process is for visionaries only

of the economic value my habits
the planning process for decisions

I can see only the back of falling values
and for which the plan agreed
