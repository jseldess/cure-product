('value', 'rate')

Then I cannot see face value
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

value falling off the edge of the face
and my heart rate

The CEO tells me to embody values
Strategy comes before morning

I see only the back of falling values
and strategies not tactics

of my economic value
Aspirational strategy

I can see only the back of falling values
I aspirate with little vision

And as an extension of the values
