('value', 'told')

Then I cannot see face value
I told her a story, she drew waves.

value falling off the edge of the face
I am told ventillation

The value falling off the edge of the face
I am told by no ventillation

The CEO tells me to embody values
I am told by the ventillation

I see only the back of falling values
which ran to be told
