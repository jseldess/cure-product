('value', 'turn')

Then I cannot see face value
in a sharp downward turn 

value falling off the edge of the face
In a sharp downard turn

And as an extension of the values
sudden downward turn

The value falling off the edge of the face
I keep turning back again myself

The CEO tells me to embody values
I keep turning back

The value falling off the edge of th face
who knows how to turn it off
