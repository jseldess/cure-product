('value', 'vision')

Then I cannot see face value
I had me a vision

And as an extension of the values
The planning process for visions

of my economic value
The planning process is for visionaries only

of the economic value my habits
aspirating visions

and key value
aspirating with visions

As an extension of the values
aspirating with little visions
