('value', 'were')

Then I cannot see face value
When we had jobs that were to earn

The CEO tells me to embody values
I wish my desires were open

And as an extension of the values
I argued the days were longer

that their economic value 
I agrued the days were longer

As an extension of the values
The days were long
