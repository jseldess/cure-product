('value', 'When')

Then I cannot see face value
When I woke up in the morning

value falling off the edge of the face
When I want something

And as an extension of the values
When we had jobs that were to earn

The CEO tells me to embody values
When they really take hold of my finger

The value falling off the edge of th face
When closed to my knowing
