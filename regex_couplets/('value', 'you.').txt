('value', 'you.')

Then I cannot see face value
Though how can you know without direction

value falling off the edge of the face
You can hear it also through your leisure

The value falling off the edge of the face
if you have providence to excess

The CEO tells me to embody values
That you can see only the back of

then I can see only the back values
your bid to the next highest ranked network

And as an extension of the values
since you can imagine movement

As an extension of the values
where you can earn more
