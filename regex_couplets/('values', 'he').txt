('values', 'he')

And as an extension of the values
The South Carolina primary 

The CEO tells me to embody values
Or the company

I see only the back of falling values
blue and sun again a second, then night

I see the back of falling values
The planning process for visions

I can see only values falling back
then I cannot see face value

I can see only the back of falling values
What the next step

then I can see only the back of values
out in the snow fall

I tried to feel the key values extending 
I argued the days felt longer

then I can see only the back values
of the habits they create

I tried to feel the extension of key values
when trying to feel the extension of key values

As an extension of the values
that potential is there for you
