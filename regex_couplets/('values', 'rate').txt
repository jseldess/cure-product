('values', 'rate')

And as an extension of the values
and my heart rate

The CEO tells me to embody values
Strategy comes before morning

I see only the back of falling values
and strategies not tactics

I see the back of falling values
Aspirational strategy

I can see only the back of falling values
I aspirate with little vision

As an extension of the values
