('ventillation', 'earn')

I am told ventillation
When we had jobs that were to earn

by no ventillation my purpose
learned without too much difficulty to code

I am told by the ventillation
Then I am learning to code

So I am told by the ventillation
I am learning to code

The ventillation rushes on
where you can earn more
