('ventillation', 'he')

I am told ventillation
on the time line I was on

by no ventillation my purpose
I am the first in the office

I am told by no ventillation
over the long line up in the sky

I am told by the ventillation
Then I am learning to code

So I am told by the ventillation
So that I notice I am the only one

The ventillation rushes on
So that I donâ€™t notice I am the only one
