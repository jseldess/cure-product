('versing', 'he')

in traversing my purchase
talking into pheasants bending themselves

though as for conversing
up in the television

of my purpose in versing
I get through there

in versing my surfeit
in the sense of watching

in traversing my purpose
in the long time they were on

in traversing my circuit
in pursuit of the sight

in conversing of my purpose
even when close to my owning

of my purpose in conversing
I get from here through there

in traversing get through there
under the last seen principle

versing my circuit
I get here through there
