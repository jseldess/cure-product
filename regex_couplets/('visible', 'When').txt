('visible', 'When')

I assumed it was visible
When I woke up in the morning

Iâ€™ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
When we had jobs that were to earn

Divisible or
When they really take hold of my finger

And make myself a visible
When closed to my knowing

I assume the offers divisible
