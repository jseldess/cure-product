('visible', 'directly')

I assumed it was visible
if not directly on my skin

Iâ€™ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
But not to me directly

And make myself a visible
The sun high enough to enter directly 

I assume the offers divisible
The sun high enough to strike directly

I assumed that they were divisible
