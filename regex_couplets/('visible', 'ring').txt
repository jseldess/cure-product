('visible', 'ring')

I assumed it was visible
interferring 

Iâ€™ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
ring

And make myself a visible
hovering above standing water

I assume the offers divisible
The prospect for veering healthily

that they were divisible
Or can have seen offering possession

I assumed that they were divisible
seen having or offering possession
