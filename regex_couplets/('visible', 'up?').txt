('visible', 'up?')

I assumed it was visible
into the stream of pictures

Iâ€™ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner
value falling off the edge of the face

And make myself a visible
and invaluable partner

Divisible or
Attributable or

I assume the offers divisible
I assumed 

that they were visible
and could be inflected with reasons

that they were divisible
decisions that can be attributable

I assumed that they were divisible
You can have seen offering
