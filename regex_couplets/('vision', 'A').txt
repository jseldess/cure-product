('vision', 'A')

I had me a vision
And as an extension of the values

The planning process for visions
ASPIRATING

The planning process is for visionaries only
Aspirational strategy

aspirating visions
As an extension of the values

aspirating with little visions
All that I can think I want

up in the television pleasure
A defeated

The long time I had a vision
COPY DREAM 

I resume attributable visions
As a clone, illegally conceived

there wasnâ€™t any television 
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
And we could inhabit the room easy

joined in my television
Aligned or not with my interests

visions that can be attainable
All that I own messageable

revisions that can be attributable
