('vision', 'My')

I had me a vision
My associations

aspirating with visions
My purpose up in the sky

there wasnâ€™t any television 
My means without gravity

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
My daughter with her way

joined in my television
My say to the elections

visions that can be attainable
