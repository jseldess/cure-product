('vision', 'To')

I had me a vision
Tomorrow

The planning process for visions
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

The long time I had a vision
To neither study

there wasnâ€™t any television 
To the ends of transactions

joined in my television
To the right of determined elections

visions that can be attainable
