('vision', 'while')

I had me a vision
while wrapped in static

I resume attributable visions
while wrapped in explicit static

The long time I was a vision
while we’re wrapped in static

I had a vision
while consuming damage

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
I answered while interfaced

visions that can be attainable
for a while to listen already

revisions that can be attributable
For a while I think I don’t listen
