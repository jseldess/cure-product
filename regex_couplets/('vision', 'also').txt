('vision', 'also')

I had me a vision
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

up in the television pleasure
I cannot clear it also through investiture

up in the television
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

there was no television to hear
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I resume attributable visions
You can hear it also through static leisure

The long time I had a vision
You can hear it also through your leisure

The long time I was a vision
also didn’t really move

joined me in wasting my vision
