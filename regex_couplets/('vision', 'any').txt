('vision', 'any')

I had me a vision
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating visions
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating with visions
The entire company

embodied with little visions
The days aligned for company

little visions
The days aligned long company

aspirating with little visions
That company creates a life

I aspirate with little vision
there wasn’t any television 

I resume unassimilable visions
not many face up

up in the television pleasure
though not many facts up in the sky

The long time I had a vision
in not many tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
Though in not many acts

I resume attributable visions
I walk up and don’t work anymore

The long time I was a vision
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
or alter of course the time anyway

joined in my television
or imagined anyway

visions that can be attainable
