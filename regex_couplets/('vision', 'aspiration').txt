('vision', 'aspiration')

I had me a vision
They are called aspirational

The planning process is for visionaries only
with little reasons to aspiration

embodied with little visions
embodied aspirations

little visions
with little reason to aspiration

aspirating with little visions
full of aspirations

I reuse unassimilable visions
