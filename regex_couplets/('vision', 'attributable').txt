('vision', 'attributable')

I had me a vision
I resume attributable visions

The long time I had a vision
attributable visions

visions that can be attributable
that can be attributable

of attributable visions
that decisions can be attributable

joined in my television
decisions that can be attributable

visions that can be attainable
revisions that can be attributable

at home visions can be attainable
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
