('vision', 'bill')

I had me a vision
I hear it between bills and stuff

The planning process for visions
I can hear it between bills and stuff

I reuse unassimilable visions
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I resume unassimilable visions
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

there was no television to hear
I cannot hear it between bills

I resume attributable visions
billowing in the cloud

attributable visions
until the bill came

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
the bill my detuning 

visions that can be attainable
between bills and stuffed animals

revisions that can be attributable
