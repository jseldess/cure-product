('vision', 'but')

I had me a vision
but the sun isn’t up

The planning process for visions
but it continued

aspirating with visions
but it continued rippling muscle

aspirating with little visions
but would I love her the same

I reuse unassimilable visions
but they are black spots

I resume unassimilable visions
but I can hear them

The long time I had a vision
I resume attributable visions

The long time I was a vision
attributable visions

visions that can be attributable
that can be attributable

of attributable visions
that decisions can be attributable

joined in my television
but for memory elsewhere

visions that can be attainable
revisions that can be attributable

at home visions can be attainable
but I own all that’s messageable
