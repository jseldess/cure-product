('vision', 'came')

I had me a vision
I invited most of what came next

aspirating with visions
I came back to me

I resume attributable visions
I came after my past

attributable visions
until the bill came

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
and came home to rewind inflections

visions that can be attainable
and came home to rewind

revisions that can be attributable
