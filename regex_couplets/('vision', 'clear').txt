('vision', 'clear')

I had me a vision
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

up in the television pleasure
I cannot clear it also through investiture

up in the television
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

there was no television to hear
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I resume attributable visions
