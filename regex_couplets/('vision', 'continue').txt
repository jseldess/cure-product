('vision', 'continue')

I had me a vision
but it continued

aspirating with visions
but it continued rippling muscle

aspirating with little visions
no solid ground to continue along

there wasnâ€™t any television 
I continue to presume

attributable visions
I continue to subsume

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
I continue to consume

joined in my television
