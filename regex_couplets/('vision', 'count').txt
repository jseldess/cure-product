('vision', 'count')

I had me a vision
without the long time I was accounting

there wasnâ€™t any television 
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I resume attributable visions
So I constellate the time family country

The long time I had a vision
without the long time I was on accounting

attributable visions
More reasons around my country 

joined in my television
