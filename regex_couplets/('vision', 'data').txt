('vision', 'data')

I had me a vision
I’ll pull my data higher up

The planning process for visions
The days of private data

aspirating with little visions
The days of public data

I aspirate with little vision
trackers collecting data on users

there wasn’t any television 
my interfaced stand data

visions that can be attainable
