('vision', 'day')

I had me a vision
I argued the days felt longer

The planning process is for visionaries only
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating visions
The days long aligned

aspirating with visions
I argued the days were longer

embodied with little visions
The days are long

little visions
The days were long aligned

aspirating with little visions
embodied everyday

I aspirate with little vision
The days were long

I reuse unassimilable visions
The day

there wasnâ€™t any television 
at least most days

joined in my television
