('vision', 'decision')

I had me a vision
the planning process for decisions

The planning process for visions
attributable decisions

visions that can be attributable
decisions that can be attributable

of attributable visions
forgetting decisions 

there wasnâ€™t any television 
decisioned to learn 

joined in my television
decisioned to learn back

visions that can be attainable
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
