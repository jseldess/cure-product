('vision', 'do')

I had me a vision
the dogs and lillies

The planning process for visions
What I do in my liesure

I reuse unassimilable visions
Undoubtedly 

there wasn’t any television 
I walk up and don’t work anymore

The long time I had a vision
here is the site of the battle of maldon

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

joined in my television
I only think I don’t listen

revisions that can be attributable
