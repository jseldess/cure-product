('vision', 'eat')

I had me a vision
executive breath

The planning process for visions
of the habits I create

The planning process is for visionaries only
of the habits they create

aspirating visions
of the habits they create.

aspirating with visions
That company creates a life

aspirating with little visions
it was not just a defeat

The long time I had a vision
And from that great distance

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
was not just a defeat

there wasnâ€™t any television 
for the creation of the universe

joined in my television
