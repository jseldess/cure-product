('vision', 'ending')

I had me a vision
I tried to feel the key values extending 

The planning process is for visionaries only
talking into pheasants bending themselves

The long time I had a vision
talking into percents bending themselves

I resume attributable visions
walking into percents blending themselves

attributable visions
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

there wasnâ€™t any television 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

joined in my television
battery dawn nights ending themselves

visions that can be attainable
