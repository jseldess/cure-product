('vision', 'enter')

I had me a vision
The sun high enough to enter directly 

The long time I had a vision
I enter the flattening mirror

I resume attributable visions
I have entered my purposes

there wasnâ€™t any television 
I have entered my phone

joined in my television
I had entered my phone

visions that can be attainable
