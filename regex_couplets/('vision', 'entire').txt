('vision', 'entire')

I had me a vision
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating visions
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

aspirating with visions
The entire company

embodied with little visions
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

little visions
