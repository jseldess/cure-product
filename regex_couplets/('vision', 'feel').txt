('vision', 'feel')

I had me a vision
I tried to feel the key values extending 

The planning process is for visionaries only
I tried to feel the extension of key values

The planning process for visions
when trying to feel the extension of key values

aspirating visions
What would I feel without that goal

there wasnâ€™t any television 
But my not feeling the memory aside

joined in my television
which I feel formerly about for

visions that can be attainable
