('vision', 'front')

I had me a vision
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

The planning process for visions
in front of the set afternoon

The planning process is for visionaries only
in front of the set of regulations

aspirating visions
And need out in front purchase

there wasnâ€™t any television 
behind or out front or up above

visions that can be attainable
