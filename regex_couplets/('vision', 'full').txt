('vision', 'full')

I had me a vision
I am full of potential

aspirating with visions
with full potential to movement

embodied with little visions
full of aspirations

little visions
full of potential

aspirating with little visions
full of the missing words

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
still carefully

joined in my television
