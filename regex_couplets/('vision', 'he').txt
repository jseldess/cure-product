('vision', 'he')

I had me a vision
there was no promotion

The planning process for visions
upsent in the afternoon

The planning process is for visionaries only
What the next step

aspirating visions
I tried to feel the key values extending 

aspirating with visions
off the end myself

embodied with little visions
And as an extension of the values

little visions
The days were long aligned

aspirating with little visions
As an extension of the values

I aspirate with little vision
that potential is there for you

I reuse unassimilable visions
talking into pheasants bending themselves

The long time I had a vision
without the long time I was accounting

there wasn’t any television 
– The Pixies

I resume unassimilable visions
Where I take my liesure

up in the television pleasure
though not many facts up in the sky

up in the television
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
I cannot hear it between bills

I resume attributable visions
as far back as my history heard

The long time I was a vision
until I purpose the horizon

I had a vision
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

attributable visions
I get through there

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses

joined in my television
By my memory elsewhere

visions that can be attainable
I presume the offers

revisions that can be attributable
The prospects there already

at home visions can be attainable
So I presume the offers already
