('vision', 'here')

I had me a vision
there was no promotion

The planning process for visions
There was very little physical activity

aspirating with visions
that potential is there for you

aspirating with little visions
Where I take my liesure

there wasnâ€™t any television 
there was no television to hear

I resume attributable visions
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

The long time I had a vision
but where is it

The long time I was a vision
I get through there

attributable visions
I get from here through there

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
here is the site of the battle of maldon

joined in my television
By my memory elsewhere

visions that can be attainable
The prospects there already

revisions that can be attributable
traffick is there nonetheless
