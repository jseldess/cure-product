('vision', 'if')

I had me a vision
learned without too much difficulty to code

The planning process for visions
That company creates a life

aspirating with little visions
Life is with people

I aspirate with little vision
If I take a different measure

I reuse unassimilable visions
If I take some different measure

I resume unassimilable visions
if there is anything 

there wasnâ€™t any television 
if only on the way to the trash

revisions that can be attributable
