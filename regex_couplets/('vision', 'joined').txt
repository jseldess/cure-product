('vision', 'joined')

I had me a vision
I was enjoined to act again myself

The planning process for visions
I was enjoined to act

aspirating visions
I am enjoined to act again

aspirating with visions
I was enjoined to act against

embodied with little visions
joined in my television

joined in my wasting vision
joined me in wasting my vision

visions that can be attainable
