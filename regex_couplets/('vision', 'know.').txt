('vision', 'know.')

I had me a vision
I even know what I would find

I resume unassimilable visions
even when close to my knowing

I resume attributable visions
When closed to my knowing

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
knowing the constituents

there wasnâ€™t any television 
who knows the way

joined in my television
that their knowing

visions that can be attainable
