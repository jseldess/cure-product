('vision', 'live')

I had me a vision
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I resume attributable visions
Which is a pleasure to never live out

The long time I had a vision
where I send and relive aside

there wasnâ€™t any television 
where I send and relive

joined in my television
