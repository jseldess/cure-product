('vision', 'longer')

I had me a vision
I argued the days felt longer

The planning process is for visionaries only
I argued the days were longer

aspirating visions
I agrued the days were longer

aspirating with visions
I argued that the days were longer

embodied with little visions
without longer damage

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
