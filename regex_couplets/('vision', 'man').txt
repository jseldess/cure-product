('vision', 'man')

I had me a vision
not many face up

up in the television pleasure
though not many facts up in the sky

I resume unassimilable visions
in not many tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
Though in not many acts

I resume attributable visions
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
They have very many choices

there wasnâ€™t any television 
The many transparent pixel calls

joined in my television
