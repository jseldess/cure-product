('vision', 'middle')

I had me a vision
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

The long time I had a vision
stopping in the middle

visions that can be attainable
stepping in the middle

at home visions can be attainable
stepping off into the middle

revisions that can be attributable
stepping off in to the middle
