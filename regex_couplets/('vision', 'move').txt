('vision', 'move')

I had me a vision
since I can imagine movement

aspirating with visions
with little reasons to move

embodied with little visions
with full potential to movement

little visions
with little reason to move

aspirating with little visions
since you can imagine movement

I aspirate with little vision
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

there wasn’t any television 
and literally moved

joined in my television
also didn’t really move

joined me in wasting my vision
not literally moved about

visions that can be attainable
