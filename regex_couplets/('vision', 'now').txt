('vision', 'now')

I had me a vision
Right now I’m the cart

The planning process for visions
out in the snow

The planning process is for visionaries only
out in the snow fall

aspirating visions
I take it out in the snow fall

there wasn’t any television 
I even know what I would find

I resume unassimilable visions
even when close to my knowing

I resume attributable visions
When closed to my knowing

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
knowing the constituents

joined in my television
that their knowing

visions that can be attainable
