('vision', 'our')

I had me a vision
or an available resource

The planning process for visions
with four key value pairs

The planning process is for visionaries only
your bid to the next highest ranked network

aspirating visions
You can hear it also through your leisure

I resume attributable visions
reasons resources

The long time I had a vision
or alter of course the time anyway

there wasnâ€™t any television 
Who throws contours away

joined in my television
phrase them of our possessions

visions that can be attainable
