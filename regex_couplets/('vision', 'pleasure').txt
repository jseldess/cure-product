('vision', 'pleasure')

I had me a vision
there was no walking along the pleasure

there wasnâ€™t any television 
up in the television pleasure

I resume unassimilable visions
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

up in the television
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I resume attributable visions
Which is a pleasure to never live out

The long time I had a vision
