('vision', 'prospect')

I had me a vision
the impulse for my own prospects

there wasnâ€™t any television 
stopping into the prospect

joined in my television
speech that is of by prospects

visions that can be attainable
The prospects there already

revisions that can be attributable
The prospect for careening attached
