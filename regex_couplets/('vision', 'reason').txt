('vision', 'reason')

I had me a vision
with little reason to move

aspirating with visions
with little reasons to aspiration

embodied with little visions
with little reasons to move

little visions
with little reason to aspiration

aspirating with little visions
embodied with little reason

I reuse unassimilable visions
reasons resources

The long time I had a vision
More reasons around my country 

there wasnâ€™t any television 
and could be inflected with reasons

visions that can be attainable
