('vision', 'reasons')

I had me a vision
with little reasons to aspiration

embodied with little visions
with little reasons to move

little visions
reasons resources

The long time I had a vision
More reasons around my country 

there wasnâ€™t any television 
and could be inflected with reasons

visions that can be attainable
