('vision', 'resume')

I had me a vision
I resume unassimilable visions

The long time I had a vision
I resume indelible tracks

up in the television pleasure
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

up in the television
I resume attributable visions

The long time I was a vision
I continue to presume

attributable visions
I presume to others

there wasnâ€™t any television 
So I presume the offers already

visions that can be attainable
I presume the offers

revisions that can be attributable
So I resume the offers already

at home visions can be attainable
So I presume the offers
