('vision', 'ring')

I had me a vision
actually considering the end

I resume unassimilable visions
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I resume attributable visions
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

attributable visions
storing in surfeit

there wasnâ€™t any television 
firing and connecting somewhere

joined in my television
The prospect for veering healthily

revisions that can be attributable
Or can have seen offering possession
