('vision', 'set')

I had me a vision
in front of the set afternoon

The planning process is for visionaries only
in front of the set of regulations

The planning process for visions
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
upset by Gingrich

there wasnâ€™t any television 
presets

visions that can be attainable
