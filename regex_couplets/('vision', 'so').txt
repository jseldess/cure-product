('vision', 'so')

I had me a vision
or an available resource

The planning process for visions
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating visions
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating with visions
My associations

embodied with little visions
with little reason to move

little visions
with little reason to aspiration

aspirating with little visions
embodied with little reason

I reuse unassimilable visions
no solid ground to continue along

there wasn’t any television 
If I take some different measure

I resume unassimilable visions
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

up in the television pleasure
I cannot clear it also through investiture

up in the television
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

there was no television to hear
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I resume attributable visions
You can hear it also through static leisure

The long time I had a vision
You can hear it also through your leisure

The long time I was a vision
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

joined in my television
also didn’t really move

joined me in wasting my vision
buy in the sound privacy

visions that can be attainable
and could be inflected with reasons

revisions that can be attributable
