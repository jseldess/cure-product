('vision', 'static')

I had me a vision
wrapped in static and explicit statements

up in the television pleasure
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

up in the television
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I resume attributable visions
You can hear it also through static leisure

The long time I had a vision
while wrapped in static

The long time I was a vision
while weâ€™re wrapped in static

I had a vision
