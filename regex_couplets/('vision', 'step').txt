('vision', 'step')

I had me a vision
What the next step

The planning process for visions
Whatâ€™s the next step

The planning process is for visionaries only
The next step 

aspirating visions
from which to step off

aspirating with little visions
step in by the prospect

joined in my television
phase decision step in

visions that can be attainable
stepping in the middle

at home visions can be attainable
stepping off into the middle

revisions that can be attributable
stepping off in to the middle
