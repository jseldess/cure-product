('vision', 'story')

I had me a vision
Forecasting the story before dawn

The planning process for visions
as far back as my history heard

I resume unassimilable visions
You need history

The long time I had a vision
for to tire as far back as my history

The long time I was a vision
for as far back as my history

I had a vision
