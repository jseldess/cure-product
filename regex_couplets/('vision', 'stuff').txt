('vision', 'stuff')

I had me a vision
I hear it between bills and stuff

The planning process for visions
I can hear it between bills and stuff

I reuse unassimilable visions
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I resume unassimilable visions
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

there was no television to hear
and stuff up in the sky

I resume attributable visions
between bills and stuffed animals

visions that can be attainable
