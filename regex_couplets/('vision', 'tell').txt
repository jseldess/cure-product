('vision', 'tell')

I had me a vision
I had to tell them the news

aspirating with little visions
So I constellate the time family country

The long time I had a vision
I tell you my purposes

there wasnâ€™t any television 
I tell you the weight of my purchases

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
and that man comes on to tell me 

joined in my television
