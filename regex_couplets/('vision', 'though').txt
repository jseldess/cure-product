('vision', 'though')

I had me a vision
I had nightmares though

aspirating with visions
though not many freeze up

up in the television pleasure
though not many facts up in the sky

I resume unassimilable visions
though as for conversing

up in the television
though in not many acts up in the sky

I resume attributable visions
though it was most emphatically that

The long time I had a vision
I thought

there wasn’t any television 
after though there’s no memory

joined in my television
I answered what I thought

visions that can be attainable
