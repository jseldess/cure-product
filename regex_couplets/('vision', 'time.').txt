('vision', 'time.')

I had me a vision
On the timeline I was on

The planning process for visions
The long time I had a vision

there wasnâ€™t any television 
without the long time I was accounting

I resume unassimilable visions
So I constellate the time family country

The long time I was a vision
which is the long time I was on

I resume attributable visions
without the long time I was on accounting

attributable visions
or alter of course the time anyway

joined in my television
in the long time they were on

visions that can be attainable
