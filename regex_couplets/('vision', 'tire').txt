('vision', 'tire')

I had me a vision
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating visions
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

aspirating with visions
The entire company

embodied with little visions
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

little visions
until I could not tire 

up in the television pleasure
until I could not be tired

I resume attributable visions
for to tire as far back as my history

The long time I had a vision
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
