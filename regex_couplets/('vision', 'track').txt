('vision', 'track')

I had me a vision
I reuse indelible tracks 

The long time I had a vision
The first track

I resume unassimilable visions
I refuse indelible tracks

up in the television pleasure
I resume indelible tracks

up in the television
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
in not many tracks up in the sky

I resume attributable visions
and other types of tracking technology

there wasnâ€™t any television 
which as tracked befitted 

joined in my television
which as tracked befitted phased

visions that can be attainable
