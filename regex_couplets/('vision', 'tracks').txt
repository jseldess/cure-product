('vision', 'tracks')

I had me a vision
I reuse indelible tracks 

The long time I had a vision
I refuse indelible tracks

up in the television pleasure
I resume indelible tracks

up in the television
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

I resume unassimilable visions
in not many tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
