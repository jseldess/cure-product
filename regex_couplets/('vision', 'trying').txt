('vision', 'trying')

I had me a vision
when trying to feel the extension of key values

The planning process for visions
that I hear without trying

I resume unassimilable visions
wearing trying talking into it

I resume attributable visions
I spun around trying to touch the spots

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
