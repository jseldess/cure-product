('vision', 'until')

I had me a vision
until my purpose up in the sky

The planning process for visions
until I could not tire 

up in the television pleasure
until I could not be tired

I resume attributable visions
until I could not be hired

I had a vision
until I purpose up in the sky

there wasnâ€™t any television 
until I purchase up the sky

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
until a happier time found

joined in my television
