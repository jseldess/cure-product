('vision', 'up?')

I had me a vision
And as an extension of the values

The planning process for visions
upsent in the afternoon

The planning process is for visionaries only
of my economic value

aspirating visions
and key value

aspirating with visions
but it continued

embodied with little visions
with full potential to movement

little visions
full of potential

aspirating with little visions
full of aspirations

I aspirate with little vision
As an extension of the values

I reuse unassimilable visions
without the long time I was accounting

there wasn’t any television 
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I resume unassimilable visions
I reuse indelible tracks 

The long time I had a vision
Where I take my liesure

up in the television pleasure
though not many facts up in the sky

up in the television
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

there was no television to hear
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I resume attributable visions
If I take a different measure

The long time I was a vision
until I could not be tired

I had a vision
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

attributable visions
attributable decisions

visions that can be attributable
that can be attributable

of attributable visions
in traversing my purpose

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
a futile joyous white sun

joined in my television
Selma’s squirrel and chickadee

joined me in wasting my vision
my daughter’s squirrel and chickadee joined me

visions that can be attainable
I presume the offers

revisions that can be attributable
between bills and stuffed animals

at home visions can be attainable
I offer to you
