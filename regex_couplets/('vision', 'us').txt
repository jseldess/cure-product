('vision', 'us')

I had me a vision
The ventillation rushes on

The planning process for visions
So stay with us

aspirating with little visions
but it continued rippling muscle

I aspirate with little vision
I reuse unassimilable visions

The long time I had a vision
because there was no solid ground to continue along

there wasnâ€™t any television 
I reuse indelible tracks 

I resume unassimilable visions
I refuse indelible tracts

up in the television pleasure
I want to cite a poem so usual

The long time I was a vision
I have them trust in me

I resume attributable visions
a futile joyous white sun

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

joined in my television
radiating from housing

visions that can be attainable
