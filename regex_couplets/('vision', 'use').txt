('vision', 'use')

I had me a vision
I reuse unassimilable visions

The long time I had a vision
because there was no solid ground to continue along

there wasnâ€™t any television 
I reuse indelible tracks 

I resume unassimilable visions
I refuse indelible tracts

up in the television pleasure
I used my technology

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
trackers collecting data on users

joined in my television
