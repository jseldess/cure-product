('vision', 'very')

I had me a vision
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating visions
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating with visions
There was very little physical activity

embodied with little visions
embodied everyday

aspirating with little visions
They have very many choices

there wasnâ€™t any television
