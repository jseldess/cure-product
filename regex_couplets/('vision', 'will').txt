('vision', 'will')

I had me a vision
will not be the same

I resume unassimilable visions
that will spur me on

I resume attributable visions
would only willingly break

there wasnâ€™t any television 
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

joined in my television
my daughter will learn 

visions that can be attainable
