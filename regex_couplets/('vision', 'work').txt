('vision', 'work')

I had me a vision
Having transitioned from leisure to work

The planning process for visions
your bid to the next highest ranked network

The planning process is for visionaries only
I need the work

up in the television pleasure
I walk up and don’t work anymore

The long time I had a vision
nor work in this way daily

there wasn’t any television
