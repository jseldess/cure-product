('vision', 'wrapped')

I had me a vision
wrapped in static and explicit statements

up in the television pleasure
wrapped in static implicit statements

up in the television
wrapped in static

I resume attributable visions
while wrapped in static

The long time I had a vision
while wrapped in explicit static

The long time I was a vision
while weâ€™re wrapped in static

I had a vision
