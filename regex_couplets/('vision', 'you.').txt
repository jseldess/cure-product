('vision', 'you.')

I had me a vision
That you can see only the back of

The planning process for visions
your bid to the next highest ranked network

The planning process is for visionaries only
since you can imagine movement

aspirating with visions
where you can earn more 

there wasnâ€™t any television 
You can hear it also through your leisure

I resume attributable visions
If you have confidence regardless all else

The long time I had a vision
you need history

The long time I was a vision
a futile joyous white sun

cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

joined in my television
the young ripples inaudibly

visions that can be attainable
