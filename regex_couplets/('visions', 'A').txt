('visions', 'A')

The planning process for visions
ASPIRATING

aspirating visions
And as an extension of the values

aspirating with visions
As an extension of the values

aspirating with little visions
All that I can think I want

I resume unassimilable visions
A defeated

I resume attributable visions
COPY DREAM 

attributable visions
As a clone, illegally conceived

visions that can be attainable
All that I own messageable

revisions that can be attributable
