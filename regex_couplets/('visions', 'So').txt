('visions', 'so')

The planning process for visions
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating visions
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating with visions
My associations

embodied with little visions
with little reason to move

little visions
with little reason to aspiration

aspirating with little visions
embodied with little reason

I reuse unassimilable visions
no solid ground to continue along

I resume unassimilable visions
If I take some different measure

I resume attributable visions
You can hear it also through static leisure

attributable visions
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

visions that can be attainable
and could be inflected with reasons

revisions that can be attributable
