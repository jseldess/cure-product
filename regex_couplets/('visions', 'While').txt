('visions', 'while')

The planning process for visions
while wrapped in static

I resume attributable visions
while wrapped in explicit static

attributable visions
while consuming damage

visions that can be attainable
for a while to listen already

revisions that can be attributable
For a while I think I donâ€™t listen
