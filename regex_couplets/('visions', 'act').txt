('visions', 'act')

The planning process for visions
and strategies not tactics

aspirating visions
I am bid to act again

aspirating with visions
I am enjoined to act again

embodied with little visions
I was enjoined to act again myself

little visions
There was very little physical activity

aspirating with little visions
actually considering the end

I resume unassimilable visions
I refuse indelible tracts

I resume attributable visions
we had inhabited actually

visions that can be attainable
before I act on them

revisions that can be attributable
