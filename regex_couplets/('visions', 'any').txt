('visions', 'any')

The planning process for visions
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating visions
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating with visions
The entire company

embodied with little visions
The days aligned for company

little visions
The days aligned long company

aspirating with little visions
That company creates a life

I reuse unassimilable visions
there wasn’t any television 

I resume unassimilable visions
not many face up

I resume attributable visions
I walk up and don’t work anymore

attributable visions
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

visions that can be attainable
