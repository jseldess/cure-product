('visions', 'aspiration')

The planning process for visions
They are called aspirational

aspirating visions
with little reasons to aspiration

embodied with little visions
embodied aspirations

little visions
with little reason to aspiration

aspirating with little visions
full of aspirations

I reuse unassimilable visions
