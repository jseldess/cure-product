('visions', 'company')

The planning process for visions
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating visions
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating with visions
The entire company

embodied with little visions
The days aligned for company

little visions
The days aligned long company

aspirating with little visions
That company creates a life

I reuse unassimilable visions
