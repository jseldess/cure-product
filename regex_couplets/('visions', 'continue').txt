('visions', 'continue')

The planning process for visions
but it continued

aspirating with visions
but it continued rippling muscle

aspirating with little visions
no solid ground to continue along

I resume unassimilable visions
I continue to presume

attributable visions
I continue to subsume

visions that can be attainable
