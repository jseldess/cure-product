('visions', 'could')

The planning process for visions
until I could not tire 

I resume unassimilable visions
until I could not be tired

I resume attributable visions
until I could not be hired

attributable visions
I could consume the dream

visions that can be attainable
and could be inflected with reasons

revisions that can be attributable
