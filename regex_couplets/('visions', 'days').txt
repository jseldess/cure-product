('visions', 'days')

The planning process for visions
I argued the days felt longer

aspirating visions
The days long aligned

aspirating with visions
I argued the days were longer

embodied with little visions
The days are long

little visions
The days were long aligned

aspirating with little visions
The days were long

I reuse unassimilable visions
at least most days

visions that can be attainable
