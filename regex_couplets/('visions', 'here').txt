('visions', 'here')

The planning process for visions
there was no promotion

aspirating visions
There was very little physical activity

aspirating with visions
that potential is there for you

aspirating with little visions
Where I take my liesure

I resume unassimilable visions
there was no television to hear

I resume attributable visions
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

attributable visions
I get through there

visions that can be attainable
The prospects there already

revisions that can be attributable
traffick is there nonetheless
