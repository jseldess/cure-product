('visions', 'hold')

The planning process for visions
Since I had to hold the entire company

aspirating with visions
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

embodied with little visions
and hold and wish to hold

I resume attributable visions
designed to hold up my underwear

visions that can be attainable
