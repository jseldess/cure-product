('visions', 'if')

The planning process for visions
That company creates a life

aspirating with little visions
Life is with people

embodied with little visions
If I take a different measure

I reuse unassimilable visions
If I take some different measure

I resume unassimilable visions
if there is anything 

visions that can be attainable
if only on the way to the trash

revisions that can be attributable
