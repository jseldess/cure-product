('visions', 'little')

The planning process for visions
with little reason to move

aspirating with visions
with little reasons to aspiration

embodied with little visions
There was very little physical activity

little visions
aspirating with little visions

I reuse unassimilable visions
I swayed a little in my state

I resume attributable visions
