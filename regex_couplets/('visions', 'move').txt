('visions', 'move')

The planning process for visions
since I can imagine movement

aspirating with visions
with little reasons to move

embodied with little visions
with full potential to movement

little visions
with little reason to move

aspirating with little visions
since you can imagine movement

I reuse unassimilable visions
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

visions that can be attainable
