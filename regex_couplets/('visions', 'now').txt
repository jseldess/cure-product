('visions', 'now')

The planning process for visions
out in the snow

aspirating visions
I take it out in the snow fall

I resume unassimilable visions
I even know what I would find

I resume attributable visions
even when close to my knowing

attributable visions
When closed to my knowing

visions that can be attainable
