('visions', 'over')

The planning process for visions
oddly grown over with historic bark

aspirating visions
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

I resume attributable visions
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

visions that can be attainable
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
