('visions', 'ring')

The planning process for visions
actually considering the end

I resume unassimilable visions
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I resume attributable visions
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

attributable visions
storing in surfeit

visions that can be attainable
The prospect for veering healthily

revisions that can be attributable
Or can have seen offering possession
