('visions', 'tire')

The planning process for visions
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

aspirating visions
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

aspirating with visions
The entire company

embodied with little visions
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

little visions
until I could not tire 

I resume unassimilable visions
until I could not be tired

I resume attributable visions
for to tire as far back as my history

attributable visions
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

visions that can be attainable
