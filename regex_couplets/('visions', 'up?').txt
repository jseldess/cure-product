('visions', 'up?')

The planning process for visions
upsent in the afternoon

aspirating visions
and key value

aspirating with visions
but it continued

embodied with little visions
And as an extension of the values

little visions
full of potential

aspirating with little visions
full of aspirations

I reuse unassimilable visions
without the long time I was accounting

I resume unassimilable visions
I reuse indelible tracks 

I resume attributable visions
If I take a different measure

attributable visions
attributable decisions

visions that can be attributable
that can be attributable

of attributable visions
in traversing my purpose

visions that can be attainable
I presume the offers

revisions that can be attributable
between bills and stuffed animals

at home visions can be attainable
I offer to you
