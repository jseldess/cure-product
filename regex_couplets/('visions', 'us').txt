('visions', 'us')

The planning process for visions
So stay with us

aspirating with little visions
but it continued rippling muscle

embodied with little visions
I reuse unassimilable visions

I resume unassimilable visions
I reuse indelible tracks 

I resume attributable visions
I want to cite a poem so usual

attributable visions
a futile joyous white sun

visions that can be attainable
