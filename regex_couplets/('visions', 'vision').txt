('visions', 'vision')

The planning process for visions
The planning process is for visionaries only

aspirating visions
I had me a vision

aspirating with visions
embodied with little visions

little visions
aspirating with little visions

I reuse unassimilable visions
The long time I had a vision

I resume unassimilable visions
up in the television pleasure

I resume attributable visions
The long time I was a vision

attributable visions
visions that can be attributable

of attributable visions
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

visions that can be attainable
revisions that can be attributable

at home visions can be attainable
