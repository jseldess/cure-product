('waiting', 'For')

There are spots waiting
For Mitt Romney

Though we are waiting for her
For my own purchases

Though we are waiting 
Formerly a way like this one

Though we can’t help waiting
Formerly away there are constant ways

waiting out front or up above 
For a while I think I don’t listen
