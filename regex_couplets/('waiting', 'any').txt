('waiting', 'any')

There are spots waiting
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Though we are waiting for her
Or alter of course the time anyway

Though we are waiting 
latency which doesn’t mean anything

Though we can’t help waiting
The many transparent pixel calls

waiting out front or up above
