('waiting', 'going')

There are spots waiting
The way that she is going

Though we are waiting 
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

though we are waiting for her
The way that I am going

Though we can’t help waiting
The way that I was going

Though we can’t help waiting for her
way I was going 

waiting out front or up above
