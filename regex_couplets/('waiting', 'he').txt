('waiting', 'he')

There are spots waiting
until I purchase up in the sky

Though we are waiting for her
to the ends of my transactions

Though we are waiting 
all parties would be held

Though we can’t help waiting
The way that I was going

Though we can’t help waiting for her
with her way to the ends

waiting out front or up above 
the right of possessions

waiting out front or up above or behind
in the fill space out front
