('waiting', 'pulse')

There are spots waiting
I send and retrieve the impulse

Though we are waiting for her
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

Though we are waiting 
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

Though we canâ€™t help waiting
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

waiting out front or up above
