('waiting', 'side')

There are spots waiting
But my not feeling the memory aside

Though we are waiting for her
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

Though we are waiting 
by the side of the hosting service

Though we canâ€™t help waiting
But my not feeling the memory inside

waiting out front or up above
