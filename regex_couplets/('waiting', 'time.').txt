('waiting', 'time.')

There are spots waiting
or alter of course the time anyway

Though we are waiting for her
formerly a long time they were on

Though we are waiting 
formerly along time they were on

Though we canâ€™t help waiting
time they were on

waiting out front or up above 
in the long time they were on
