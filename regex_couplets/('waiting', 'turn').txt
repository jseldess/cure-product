('waiting', 'turn')

There are spots waiting
who knows how to turn it off

Though we are waiting for her
Bach helps turn it off

Though we canâ€™t help waiting
My daughter turns it off too

waiting out front or up above 
I returned not sad exactly

waiting out front or up above or behind
I returned to location
