('waiting', 'up?')

There are spots waiting
until I purchase up in the sky

Though we are waiting for her
I thought

Though we are waiting 
all parties would be held

Though we can’t help waiting
Though we can’t help waiting for her

waiting out front or up above 
I returned not sad exactly

waiting out front or up above or behind
in the fill space out front
