('waiting', 'us')

There are spots waiting
a futile joyous white sun

Though we are waiting for her
in the form filled offered in trust

Though we are waiting 
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

Though we canâ€™t help waiting
radiating from housing

waiting out front or up above 
I have them trust in me
