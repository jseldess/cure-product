('walk', 'count')

Before we walk across the wide field
Then I constellate my time family country

Before we walk across the wide opening
So I constellate the time family country

there was no walking along the pleasure
without the long time I was accounting

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
around my country 

walking into percents blending themselves
More reasons around my country
