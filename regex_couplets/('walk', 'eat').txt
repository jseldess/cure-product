('walk', 'eat')

Before we walk across the wide field
too sunny to eat ice cream

Before we walk across the wide opening
I reach repeated expressions first

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
I propogated repeated expressions first

Before anyone walks across the opening
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

there was no walking along the pleasure
it was not just a defeat

walking into percents blending themselves
And from that great distance
