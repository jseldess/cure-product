('walk', 'ending')

Before we walk across the wide field
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Before we walk across the wide opening
I tried to feel the key values extending 

there was no walking along the pleasure
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
talking into percents bending themselves

walking into percents blending themselves
drawn formerly rights ending themselves
