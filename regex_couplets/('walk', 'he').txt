('walk', 'he')

Before we walk across the wide field
I’ll get there eventually

Before we walk across the wide opening
who knows the way

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
In the light of retroactive

Before anyone walks across the opening
Before anyone has walked across the opening

Before anyone has walked across the field
from the incoming stream

there was no walking along the pleasure
there was no promotion

there was no walking along
where you can earn more 

walking along the measure
walking from home along the measure

I walk up and don’t work anymore
advancing the time

walking into percents blending themselves
talking into the cents
