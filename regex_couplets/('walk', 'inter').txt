('walk', 'inter')

Before we walk across the wide field
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Before we walk across the wide opening
interjecting on a day ambition

Before anyone walks across the opening
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

there was no walking along the pleasure
Then I saw them interview

walking into percents blending themselves
my interfaced stand data
