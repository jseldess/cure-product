('walk', 'man')

Before we walk across the wide field
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

Before we walk across the wide opening
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

there was no walking along the pleasure
not many face up

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
that of the man with the dyed blond hair
