('walk', 'now')

Before we walk across the wide field
On a snow day with my children

Before we walk across the wide opening
who knows the way

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

there was no walking along the pleasure
I take it out in the snow fall

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
even when close to my knowing
