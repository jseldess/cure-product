('walk', 'story')

Before we walk across the wide field
I told her a story, she drew waves.

Before we walk across the wide opening
Forecasting the story before dawn

there was no walking along the pleasure
as far back as my history heard

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
You need history

walking into percents blending themselves
