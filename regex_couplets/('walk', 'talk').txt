('walk', 'talk')

Before we walk across the wide field
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

there was no walking along the pleasure
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
talking into percents bending themselves

walking into percents blending themselves
talking into the cents
