('walk', 'time.')

Before we walk across the wide field
Then I constellate my time family country

Before we walk across the wide opening
only fragments of time with my children

there was no walking along the pleasure
The long time I had a vision

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
The long time I was a vision

walking into percents blending themselves
the long time I was on
