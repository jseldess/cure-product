('walk', 'tire')

Before we walk across the wide field
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

there was no walking along the pleasure
until I could not tire 

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
for to tire as far back as my history

walking into percents blending themselves
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
