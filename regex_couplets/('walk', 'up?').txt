('walk', 'up?')

Before we walk across the wide field
I’ll get there eventually

Before we walk across the wide opening
In a sharp downard turn

Before anyone walks across the wide opening
conversations with our reactions

Before anyone walks across the opening
The sun isn’t up 

there was no walking along the pleasure
no solid ground to continue along

there was no walking along
where you can earn more 

walking along the measure
walking from home along the measure

I walk up and don’t work anymore
So I look up and don’t walk any

walking into percents blending themselves
If I take a different measure
