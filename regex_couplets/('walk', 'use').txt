('walk', 'use')

Before we walk across the wide field
because it was really dark

Before we walk across the wide opening
You use the most essential parts

there was no walking along the pleasure
because there was no solid ground to continue along

walking along the measure
I reuse indelible tracks 

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
I used my technology
