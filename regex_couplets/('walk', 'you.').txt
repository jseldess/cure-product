('walk', 'you.')

Before we walk across the wide field
Though how can you know without direction

there was no walking along the pleasure
where you can earn more 

walking along the measure
You can hear it also through your leisure

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
If you have confidence regardless all else

walking into percents blending themselves
a futile joyous white sun
