('want', 'any')

When I want something
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

I want to find a way to block it incoming
Before anyone buys up the opening

I want to find a way to block it
Before anyone walks across the opening

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field

I want but not to impart cynicism
at any time it can drift again

I want to cite a poem so usual
Or the company

all that I can think I want
not many face up
