('want', 'directly')

When I want something
if not directly on my skin

I want to find a way to block it incoming
of not directly from my skin

I want but not to impart cynicism
But not to me directly

all that I can think I want
The sun high enough to enter directly 

I want to cite a poem so usual
The sun high enough to strike directly
