('want', 'eat')

When I want something
I reach repeated expressions first

I want to find a way to block it incoming
I propogated repeated expressions first

I want to find a way to block it
skin smile repeated expressions

I want to find a way to block incoming
smile testing glance repeated expressions

That’s exaclty what I want for them
But I can’t let myself treat 

I want to cite a poem so usual
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I want to cite a poem
was not just a defeat

all that I can think I want
it was not just a defeat
