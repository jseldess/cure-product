('want', 'has')

When I want something
Before anyone has walked across the opening

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field

I want but not to impart cynicism
It has been since

I want to cite a poem so usual
in traversing my purchase

all that I can think I want
purchased out
