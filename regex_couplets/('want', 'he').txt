('want', 'he')

When I want something
The sun isn’t up 

I want to find a way to block it incoming
Before anyone buys up the opening

I want to find a way to block it
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

That’s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field

I want but not to impart cynicism
others desires

I want to cite a poem so usual
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I want to cite a poem
only in the case

all that I can think I want
Then blue and sun again a second, then night
