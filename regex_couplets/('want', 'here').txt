('want', 'here')

When I want something
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

I want to find a way to block it incoming
One day there is direction

I want but not to impart cynicism
I’ll get there eventually

I want to cite a poem so usual
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

I want to cite a poem
Where official policy is to catch and release

all that I can think I want
Where I take my liesure
