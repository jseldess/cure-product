('want', 'inter')

When I want something
interjecting on a day ambition

I want to find a way to block it incoming
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

I want but not to impart cynicism
way high up in the inter

I want to cite a poem so usual
hold at intervals riding forward

all that I can think I want
Then I saw them interview
