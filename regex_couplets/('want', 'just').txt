('want', 'just')

When I want something
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

I want to find a way to block it incoming
Theyâ€™re just not mine

I want but not to impart cynicism
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I want to cite a poem so usual
was not just a defeat

all that I can think I want
it was not just a defeat
