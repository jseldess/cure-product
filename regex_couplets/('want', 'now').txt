('want', 'now')

When I want something
on a snow day with my children

I want to find a way to block it incoming
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

I want but not to impart cynicism
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

I want to cite a poem so usual
out in the snow

all that I can think I want
I take it out in the snow fall
