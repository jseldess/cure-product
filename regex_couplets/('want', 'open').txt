('want', 'open')

When I want something
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

I want to find a way to block it incoming
Before anyone buys up the opening

I want to find a way to block it
Before anyone walks across the opening

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
my desires were open

all that I can think I want
The simple act opening surmounted

I want to cite a poem so usual
