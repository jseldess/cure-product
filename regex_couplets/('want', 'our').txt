('want', 'our')

When I want something
conversation with our feelings

I want to find a way to block it incoming
Of course there is a direction

Thatâ€™s exaclty what I want for them
You can hear it also through your leisure

I want to cite a poem so usual
reasons resources

I want to cite a poem
Two hours and

all that I can think I want
or alter of course the time anyway
