('want', 'so')

When I want something
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

I want to find a way to block it incoming
You can hear it also through your leisure

I want to cite a poem so usual
soft paper

I want to cite a poem
A person from a distance

all that I can think I want
If I take some different measure
