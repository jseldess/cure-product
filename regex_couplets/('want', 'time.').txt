('want', 'time.')

When I want something
only fragments of time with my children

I want but not to impart cynicism
where I sleep at times

I want to cite a poem so usual
So I constellate the time family country

I want to cite a poem
 and time in the train

all that I can think I want
The long time I had a vision
