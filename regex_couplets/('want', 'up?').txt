('want', 'up?')

When I want something
The sun isn’t up 

I want to find a way to block it incoming
such as I see

I want to find a way to block it
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

That’s exaclty what I want for them
Then fall then summer

I want but not to impart cynicism
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

I want to cite a poem so usual
You can hear it also through your leisure

I want to cite a poem
into a brigand and a murderer

all that I can think I want
black spots on a white surface
