('want', 'walk')

When I want something
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

I want to find a way to block it incoming
Before anyone walks across the opening

That’s exaclty what I want for them
Before anyone has walked across the field

I want but not to impart cynicism
there was no walking along the pleasure

all that I can think I want
I walk up and don’t work anymore

I want to cite a poem so usual
