('want', 'you.')

When I want something
Though how can you know without direction

I want but not to impart cynicism
You can hear it also through your leisure

I want to cite a poem so usual
if you have providence to excess

I want to cite a poem
If you have confidence regardless all else

all that I can think I want
you need history
