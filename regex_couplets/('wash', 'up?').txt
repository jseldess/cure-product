('wash', 'up?')

washed by my memory
all parties would be held

washed my memory
I thought

washed my purchases
I have entered my purposes

still wash conserving
still carefully

washed
I answered about

washed I answered about
after though thereâ€™s no memory

so still washed
in the form filled offered must

pre-worn and still wash them
Where in me did I lose trust
