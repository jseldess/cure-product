('watch', 'do')

when watching tv
What I do in my liesure

in the sense of watching
here is the site of the battle of maldon

I watch a movie
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I watch a moving afterimage
around the dogs and lillies

When I'm watching my tv 
latency which doesn’t mean anything

so still watch them
and it doesn’t take long

where I’m watching my tv
I only think I don’t listen
