('watch', 'he')

when watching tv
off the end myself

in the sense of watching
in the sense of sleep

I watch a movie
I get through there

always watching
which is all the time

I watch a moving afterimage
under the last seen principle

When I'm watching my tv 
– The Rolling Stones

so still watch them
Where in me pre-worn

where I’m watching my tv
where I am aside
