('ways', 'For')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

always watching
For an ungraspable time

deep into pathways from repeated travels
Formerly a way like this one

with constant ways 
Formerly away there are constant ways

with no constant ways 
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

There are constant ways
Forty-one seconds in
