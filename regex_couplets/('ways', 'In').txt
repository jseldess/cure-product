('ways', 'IN')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

always watching
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

deep into pathways from repeated travels
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

with constant ways 
PRELUDE  (IN A MINOR)

with her ways to the ends
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

I end up in Bach with constant ways
