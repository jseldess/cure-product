('ways', 'There')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

always watching
There are spots waiting

deep into pathways from repeated travels
There are constant ways

Formerly away there are constant ways
There are no constant waves

There are no constant ways
