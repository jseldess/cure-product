('ways', 'Thou')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Though there are quarters goals

always watching
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

deep into pathways from repeated travels
Though we are waiting 

with constant ways 
Though we are waiting for her

with her ways to the ends
Though we can’t help waiting

I end up in Bach with constant ways
