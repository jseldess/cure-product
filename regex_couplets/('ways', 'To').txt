('ways', 'To')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
To my children Walt Whitman

always watching
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

deep into pathways from repeated travels
To the ends of transactions

with constant ways 
To the ends of my transactions

There are constant ways
To the other end of transactions

There are no constant ways
To the other end of my actions

Formerly away there are constant ways
To the other end of transactions like this

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
To the right of determined elections
