('ways', 'actions')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
conversations with our reactions

always watching
to the ends of my transactions

deep into pathways from repeated travels
The ends of my transactions

with constant ways 
the other end transactions

with her ways to the ends
to the other end of actions

There are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

with no constant ways 
The other ends of my transactions

There are no constant ways
The other end of my transactions

Formerly away there are constant ways
To the other end of transactions like this

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
actions

with constant ways to the other end
to the other end of transactions
