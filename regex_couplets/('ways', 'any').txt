('ways', 'any')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

always watching
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

deep into pathways from repeated travels
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

with constant ways 
The many transparent pixel calls

There are no constant ways
or imagined anyway
