('ways', 'daughter')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
I love my daughter still

always watching
with my daughter

with constant ways 
My daughter helps too

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
my daughter will learn 

deep into pathways from repeated travels
my daughterâ€™s squirrel and chickadee joined me
