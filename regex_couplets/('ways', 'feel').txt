('ways', 'feel')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
conversations with our feelings

always watching
But my not feeling the memory aside

deep into pathways from repeated travels
which feels most comfortable

with constant ways 
But my not feeling the memory inside

with her ways to the ends
By my feeling the memory inside

There are constant ways
which I feel formerly about for
