('ways', 'going')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

always watching
The way that she is going

deep into pathways from repeated travels
The way that I am going

with constant ways 
The way that I was going

with her ways to the ends
way I was going 

with constant ways to the other end
A way I was going
