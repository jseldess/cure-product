('ways', 'he')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

always watching
which is all the time

deep into pathways from repeated travels
where I send and relive

with constant ways 
to the other end

with her ways to the ends
But my not feeling the memory inside

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
to the other end of actions

There are constant ways
The other end of means

Formerly away there are constant ways
The other end of transactions like this

with no constant ways 
who know the ways to their other end

There are no constant ways
The other end of my transactions

with constant ways to the other end
to the other end of transactions
