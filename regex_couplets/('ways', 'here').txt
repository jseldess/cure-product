('ways', 'here')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Of course there is a direction

always watching
I get through there

deep into pathways from repeated travels
where I send and relive

with constant ways 
Is there a baby and a bear

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
There are constant ways

Formerly away there are constant ways
There are no constant waves

There are no constant ways
where rights ended themselves
