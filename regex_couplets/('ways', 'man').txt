('ways', 'man')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

always watching
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

deep into pathways from repeated travels
and that man comes on to tell me 

with constant ways 
The many transparent pixel calls

There are no constant ways
