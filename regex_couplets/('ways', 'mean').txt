('ways', 'mean')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
What does it mean to drift

always watching
My means without gravity

deep into pathways from repeated travels
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

with constant ways 
The other end of means

Formerly away there are constant ways
To the other end of means like this one

I end up in Bach with constant ways
