('ways', 'nights')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

always watching
dawn already formerly nights 

deep into pathways from repeated travels
with dawn already formerly nights 

with constant ways 
battery dawn nights 

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
nights

There are constant ways
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

with no constant ways 
battery dawn nights ending themselves
