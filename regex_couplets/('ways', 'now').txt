('ways', 'now')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
on a snow day with my children

always watching
even when close to my knowing

deep into pathways from repeated travels
knowing the constituents

with constant ways 
who knows how to turn it off

with her ways to the ends
who knows the way

with no constant ways 
who know the ways to their other end

There are no constant ways
that their knowing
