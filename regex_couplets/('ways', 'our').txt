('ways', 'our')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
conversations with our purchase

always watching
or alter of course the time anyway

deep into pathways from repeated travels
Who throws contours away

There are constant ways
The contours exchange with you

with no constant ways 
phrase them of our possessions
