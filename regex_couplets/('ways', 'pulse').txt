('ways', 'pulse')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
impulse control

always watching
I send and retrieve the impulse

deep into pathways from repeated travels
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

with her ways to the ends
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

with constant ways 
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

There are constant ways
I stand and retrieve the impulse around
