('ways', 'side')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Iâ€™m simply inside

always watching
But my not feeling the memory aside

deep into pathways from repeated travels
where I am aside

with constant ways 
But my not feeling the memory inside

with her ways to the ends
By my feeling the memory inside

There are constant ways
44 seconds inside
