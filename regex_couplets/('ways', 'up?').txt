('ways', 'up?')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

always watching
I could in effect credit

deep into pathways from repeated travels
the duration of answers

with constant ways 
I end up Bach

with her ways to the ends
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
I stand and retrieve and pulse around

There are constant ways
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

with no constant ways 
But my not feeling the memory inside

who know the ways to their other end
I end up in Bach

There are no constant ways
and end up in Bach

Formerly away there are constant ways
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach

with constant ways to the other end
to the other end of my purpose
