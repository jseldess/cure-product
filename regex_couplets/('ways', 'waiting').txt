('ways', 'waiting')

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
There are spots waiting

deep into pathways from repeated travels
Though we are waiting 

with constant ways 
Though we are waiting for her

with her ways to the ends
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

I end up in Bach with constant ways 
waiting out front or up above
