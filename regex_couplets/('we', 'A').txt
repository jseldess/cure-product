between bills and stuffed animals
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
PREFACE

Between the face of pure joy and an interface.
All of the time

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
Actually one day there is direction

When we had jobs that were to earn
BREAK

my desires were open
A person from a distance

I wish my desires were open
And as an extension of the values

I hear it between bills and stuff
And make myself a visible

I am not allowed to see their face
Aspirational strategy

into the well controlled climate
As an extension of the values

The days were long
All that I can think I want

I can hear them between bills and stuff
A defeated

while we’re wrapped in static
COPY DREAM 

we had to say goodbye
And we had to say goodbye to her there

Sweets and coffee and juice
Articles all around stores in surfeit

Sweets and coffee
Articles all around us

Under the last principle of purchasing power
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

And from a weak distance
And for an ungraspable time

I tell you the weight of my purchases
And reached up the screen

I wear suspenders
And from that great distance

designed to hold up my underwear
And from a great distance

While we’re up in the sky
SOCIAL

They can be weighed
As a clone, illegally conceived

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
And we could inhabit the room easy

Though we are waiting for her
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

though we are still breaking in
A baby and a bear

though we are breaking in the space that it had
All parties would be held for my own purchases

Though we are breaking 
All parties would be held

between the drug store and the 
CONTRACT

formerly a long time they were on
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

formerly along time they were on
A way formerly like this one

Though we can’t help waiting
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

I answered what I thought
Aligned or not with my interests

I answered about
3 [PASSWORDS]

in the long time they were on
2 – PREAMBLE

that they were visible
All that I own messageable

careening between the preambles
