('We', 'For')

We’ll have coffee this morning
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

We had to say goodbye there
For an ungraspable time

We had to buy there
For an ungraspable purchase

We had inhabited actually
For Mitt Romney

We got paid one way by a voice
For my own purchases

We ask say in that case
For a while I think I don’t listen
