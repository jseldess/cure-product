('we', 'I\xe2\x80\x99ll')

between bills and stuffed animals
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Before we walk across the wide field
I’ll get there eventually

So I went back to sleep
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

When we had jobs that were to earn
I’ll get there ruins

I hear it between bills and stuff
I’ll pull myself higher up

I am not allowed to see their face
