('We', 'It')

We’ll have coffee this morning
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

We can wrestle them with their goals
It has been since

We had to say goodbye there
It’s not marshal exactly

We ask say in that case
