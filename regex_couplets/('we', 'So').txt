('We', 'so')

We’ll have coffee this morning
I’ll pull myself another personality type

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

We can wrestle them with their goals
You can hear it also through your leisure

We had to say goodbye there
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

We had inhabited actually
I want to cite a poem so usual

We got paid one way by a voice
More reasons around my country 

We ask say in that case
buy in the sound privacy
