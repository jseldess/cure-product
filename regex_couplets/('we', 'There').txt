('we', 'There')

between bills and stuffed animals
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
There are quarterly goals

When we had jobs that were to earn
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

while we’re wrapped in static
There are spots waiting

While we’re up in the sky
There are constant ways

I answered what I thought
