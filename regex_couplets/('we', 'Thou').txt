('We', 'Thou')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Though there are quarters goals

We can wrestle them with their goals
Though how can you know without direction

We had to say goodbye there
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

We had inhabited actually
Though we are waiting for her

We got paid one way by a voice
Though we are breaking 

We ask say in that case
