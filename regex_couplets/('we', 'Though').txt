('we', 'though')

between bills and stuffed animals
As though stationary and a destination

When we had jobs that were to earn
I had nightmares though

The days were long
though not many freeze up

I can hear them between bills and stuff
though not many facts up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
though in not many acts up in the sky

While we’re up in the sky
though it is not a simple act

while we’re wrapped in static
I thought

I have a memory between the day
though it was most emphatically that

which we can pronounce
though we are still breaking in

Though we are waiting for her
though we are breaking in the space that it had

Though we are breaking 
after though there’s no memory

Where did we lose trust
I answered what I thought

formerly along time they were on
I answered what I thought about

in the long time they were on
