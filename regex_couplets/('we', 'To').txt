('we', 'To')

between bills and stuffed animals
To my children Walt Whitman

When we had jobs that were to earn
To neither study

my desires were open
To that impossible place

I hear it between bills and stuff
Tomorrow

I am not allowed to see their face
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

while weâ€™re wrapped in static
To substitute neither study

which we can pronounce
To the ends of transactions

though we are waiting for her
To the ends of my transactions

I answered what I thought
To the right of determined elections

in the long time they were on
