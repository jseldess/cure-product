('we', 'We')

between bills and stuffed animals
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

Before we walk across the wide field
We can wrestle them with their goals

When we had jobs that were to earn
We had to say goodbye there

we had to say goodbye
We had to buy there

Sweets and coffee and juice
We had inhabited actually

And we could inhabit the room easy
We got paid one way by a voice

which we can pronounce
We ask say in that case

that they were visible
