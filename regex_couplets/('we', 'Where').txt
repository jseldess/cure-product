('we', 'Where')

between bills and stuffed animals
Where official policy is to catch and release

my desires were open
Where I put it beating

I wish my desires were open
Where I take my liesure

I can hear it between bills and stuff
Where I lead gravity

And from a weak distance
Where I need gravity

They can be weighed
Where in me did I host

Though we are waiting for her
Where I host my purposes

which we can pronounce
Where in me did I last

Though we are breaking
Where in me did I lose

by the sight of the hosting answered about
Where in me did I loose

answered about 
Where in me pre-worn

I answered about
Where in me did I lose trust

Where did we lose trust
