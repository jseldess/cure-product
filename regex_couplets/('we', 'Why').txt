('We', 'Why')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Why isn’t the sun up? Is the sun lazy?

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

We can wrestle them with their goals
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

We had to say goodbye there
