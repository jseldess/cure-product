('we', 'about')

between bills and stuffed animals
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

Between the face of pure joy and an interface.
about my childrenâ€™s consumption

Before we walk across the wide opening
burrowed about from repeated travels

answered about 
and literally moved about

Though we are waiting 
about the site

by the sight of the hosting answered about
I answered about

washed I answered about
which I feel formerly about for

between the drug store and the 
not literally moved about

in the long time they were on
I answered what I thought about

I answered what I thought
about 

in welfare and hope
