('we', 'across')

between bills and stuffed animals
Before we walk across the wide field

So I went back to sleep
Before we walk across the wide opening

before we can have a retroactive
Before anyone walks across the opening

When we had jobs that were to earn
across the retinas

The days were long
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

while weâ€™re wrapped in static
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

I assumed that they were divisible
