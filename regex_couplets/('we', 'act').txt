('we', 'act')

between bills and stuffed animals
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Before we walk across the wide opening
In the retroactive light

before we can have a retroactive
One day was actually

When we had jobs that were to earn
I was enjoined to act again

I hear it between bills and stuff
and strategies not tactics

I am not allowed to see their face
Not goals or tactics

into the well controlled climate
I am bid to act again

I argued the days were longer
I was enjoying acting against myself

I agrued the days were longer
I was enjoined to act again myself

The days were long
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
I am enjoined to act again

The days were long aligned
actually considering the end

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I refuse indelible contracts

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
Though in not many acts

While we’re up in the sky
Though it is not a simple act

while we’re wrapped in static
we had inhabited actually

and we could inhabit the room easy
to the ends of my transactions

I have a memory between the day
The ends of my transactions

between the drug store and the 
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

answered about 
To the ends of transactions

though we are waiting for her
to the ends of actions

Though we can’t help waiting
It’s not marshal exactly

I answered what I thought
I turn not sad exactly

I answered about
I return not sad exactly

in the long time they were on
before I act on them

we ask say in that case
