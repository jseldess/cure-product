('we', 'agreed')

between bills and stuffed animals
and to which I’ve agreed

Though we are waiting for her
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

Though we are breaking 
and for which the plan agreed

Though we are waiting 
that agreed one of rest

formerly a long time they were on
and to which the plan agreed

answered about 
that agreed home

that they were visible
that agreed to one the people

we ask say in that case
