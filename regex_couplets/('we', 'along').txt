('we', 'along')

between bills and stuffed animals
bring your child along

When we had jobs that were to earn
The days lined along company

The days were long
there was no walking along the pleasure

I can hear it between bills and stuff
formerly along time they were on

we ask say in that case
formerly along my say to the elections

I answered what I thought
drawn formerly along 

time they were on
along cables

at least for the duration of the answer
shone formerly along time

formerly along the time they were on
