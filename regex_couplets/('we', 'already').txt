('we', 'already')

between bills and stuffed animals
already formerly a long time

I have a memory between the day
dawn already formerly nights 

formerly a long time they were on
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

Though we are breaking 
already formely a long time

between the drug store and the 
with dawn already formerly nights 

Though we are waiting for her
So I presume the offers already

we ask say in that case
The prospects there already

between the private ambles
already brought into privacy

between the preambles
the offers there already

careening between the preambles
