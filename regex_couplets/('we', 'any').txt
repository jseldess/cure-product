('We', 'any')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

We can wrestle them with their goals
at any time it can drift again

We had to say goodbye there
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

We had inhabited actually
Or alter of course the time anyway

We got paid one way by a voice
They have very many choices

We ask say in that case
