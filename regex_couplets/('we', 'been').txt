('we', 'been')

between bills and stuffed animals
It has been since

When we had jobs that were to earn
After having been contented

I am not allowed to see their face
that having been after content

in the long time they were on
having been graspable

we had to say goodbye
Having been purchased out of you

And we had to say goodbye to her there
