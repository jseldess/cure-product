('We', 'bill')

We’ll have coffee this morning
between bills and stuffed animals

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I hear it between bills and stuff

We had to say goodbye there
until the bill came

We had inhabited actually
the bill my detuning 

We ask say in that case
bills and stuffed animals
