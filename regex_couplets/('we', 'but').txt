('we', 'but')

between bills and stuffed animals
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

Before we walk across the wide field
but not impart cynicism

When we had jobs that were to earn
Attributable or

my desires were open
but the sun isn’t up

I am not allowed to see their face
but it continued

I argued the days were longer
but it continued rippling muscle

The days were long aligned
but would I love her the same

I can hear it between bills and stuff
but they are black spots

I can hear them between bills and stuff
but I can hear them

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
I resume attributable visions

while we’re wrapped in static
attributable visions

we had to say goodbye
that decisions can be attributable

though we are waiting for her
but for memory elsewhere

I answered what I thought
but standing in memory

time they were on
decisions that can be attributable

that they were visible
revisions that can be attributable

between the private ambles
but I own all that’s messageable

careening between the preambles
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I assumed that they were divisible
