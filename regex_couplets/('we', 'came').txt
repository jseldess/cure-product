('we', 'came')

between bills and stuffed animals
I invited most of what came next

The days were long
I came back to me

we had to say goodbye
until the bill came

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
and came home to rewind inflections

we ask say in that case
and came home to rewind

I assumed that they were divisible
