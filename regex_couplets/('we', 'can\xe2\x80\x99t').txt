('we', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

between bills and stuffed animals
I can’t fix them without direction

When we had jobs that were to earn
That can’t be glimpsed

into the well controlled climate
Though we can’t help waiting

Though we can’t help waiting for her
I can’t remember them

in the long time they were on
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

I assumed that they were divisible
