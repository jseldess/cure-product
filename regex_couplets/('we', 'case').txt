('we', 'case')

between bills and stuffed animals
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
only in the case

my desires were open
I ask say in that case

Though we are waiting for her
we ask say in that case

between tracked and buffered
