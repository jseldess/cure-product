('We', 'child')

We’ll have coffee this morning
On a snow day with my children

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
as pure as my children

We can wrestle them with their goals
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

We had to say goodbye there
Even the children

We had inhabited actually
my possession of my children

We ask say in that case
speech my possession of my children
