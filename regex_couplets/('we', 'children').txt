('we', 'children')

between bills and stuffed animals
On a snow day with my children

Before we walk across the wide field
as pure as my children

So I went back to sleep
my children’s consumption

Before we walk across the wide opening
about my children’s consumption

before we can have a retroactive
only fragments of time with my children

When we had jobs that were to earn
Even the children

And we had to say goodbye to her there
my possession of my children

Though we are waiting for her
speech my possession of my children

we ask say in that case
