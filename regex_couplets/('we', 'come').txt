('We', 'come')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

We can wrestle them with their goals
Strategy comes before morning

We had to say goodbye there
and that man comes on to tell me 

We ask say in that case
and come home to remind inflections
