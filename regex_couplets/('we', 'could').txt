('we', 'could')

between bills and stuffed animals
and could be mapped and weighed

I wish my desires were open
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

I hear it between bills and stuff
until I could not tire 

I can hear them between bills and stuff
until I could not be tired

while weâ€™re wrapped in static
until I could not be hired

wearing trying talking into it
I could in effect credit

in the long time they were on
I could consume the dream

we had to say goodbye
and we could inhabit the room easy

Though we are waiting for her
and could be inflected with reasons

we ask say in that case
