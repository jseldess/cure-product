('we', 'dawn')

between bills and stuffed animals
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Before we walk across the wide opening
Forecasting the story before dawn

I am not allowed to see their face
dawn already formerly nights 

formerly a long time they were on
dawn formerly

for the duration of the answer
with dawn already formerly nights 

Though we are waiting for her
battery dawn nights 

I answered what I thought
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

time they were on
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in the long time they were on
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

formerly along time they were on
