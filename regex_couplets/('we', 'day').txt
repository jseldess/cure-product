('we', 'day')

between bills and stuffed animals
On a snow day with my children

Before we walk across the wide field
One day there is direction

When we had jobs that were to earn
I argued the days felt longer

I am not allowed to see their face
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

into the well controlled climate
The days long aligned

I argued the days were longer
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I hear it between bills and stuff
The entire everyday conservatory orangery armory company fluency truancy sensory

I agrued the days were longer
The days aligned for company

The days were long
I argued that the days were longer

The days were long aligned
The days aligned long company

I can hear it between bills and stuff
The day

we had inhabited actually
between that day

I have a memory between the day
at least most days

at least for the duration of the answer
