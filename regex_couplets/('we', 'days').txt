('we', 'days')

between bills and stuffed animals
I argued the days felt longer

I am not allowed to see their face
The days long aligned

I argued the days were longer
I agrued the days were longer

I hear it between bills and stuff
The days aligned for company

The days were long
I argued that the days were longer

The days were long aligned
The days aligned long company

I can hear it between bills and stuff
at least most days

at least for the duration of the answer
