('we', 'decisioned')

between bills and stuffed animals
decisioned to learn 

Though we are waiting for her
decisioned to learn back

we ask say in that case
phase decisioned by the prospect

between tracked and buffered
decisioned by the prospect

tracked between buffered and sizes
phase decisioned

between the private ambles
