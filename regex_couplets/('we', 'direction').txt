('We', 'direction')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Whereas direction is beside the point

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
into rotating directionless 

We can wrestle them with their goals
into rotating and directionless space

We can rest there in them with their goals
Though how can you know without direction

We had to say goodbye there
stopping off in all directions
