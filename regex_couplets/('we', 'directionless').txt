('We', 'directionless')

We’ll have coffee this morning
into rotating directionless 

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
in rotating directionless space

We can wrestle them with their goals
into rotating and directionless space

We can rest there in them with their goals
into directionless space

We had to say goodbye there
