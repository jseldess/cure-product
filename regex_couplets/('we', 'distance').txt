('we', 'distance')

between bills and stuffed animals
Falling from this distance

Before we walk across the wide opening
A person from a distance

I wish my desires were open
And from a weak distance

I tell you the weight of my purchases
And from that great distance

I wear suspenders
And from a great distance

While weâ€™re up in the sky
