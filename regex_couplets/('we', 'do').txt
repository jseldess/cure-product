('We', 'do')

We’ll have coffee this morning
The dogs and lillies

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

We can wrestle them with their goals
does not feel an exception

We had to say goodbye there
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

We had inhabited actually
and it doesn’t take long

We ask say in that case
I only think I don’t listen
