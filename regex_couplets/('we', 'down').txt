('we', 'down')

between bills and stuffed animals
in a sharp downward turn 

Before we walk across the wide field
In a sharp downard turn

Before we walk across the wide opening
It keeps coming down thankfully

before we can have a retroactive
to the down arrow

When we had jobs that were to earn
I brought my head down

my desires were open
which I brought down with qualities

I wish my desires were open
I brought my qualities down

and could be mapped and weighed
I put my bread down

I hear it between bills and stuff
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

They can be weighed
One was up where it should be down

I tell you the weight of my purposes
