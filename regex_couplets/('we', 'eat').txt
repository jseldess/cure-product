('We', 'eat')

We’ll have coffee this morning
too sunny to eat ice cream

We can wrestle them with their goals
But I can’t let myself treat 

We had to say goodbye there
And from that great distance

We had inhabited actually
was not just a defeat

We got paid one way by a voice
for the creation of the universe

We ask say in that case
