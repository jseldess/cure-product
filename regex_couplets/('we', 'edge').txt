('we', 'edge')

between bills and stuffed animals
off the edge of the world

Before we walk across the wide field
I step off the edge

So I went back to sleep
Face falling off the edge of the face

Before we walk across the wide opening
value falling off the edge of the face

before we can have a retroactive
The edge is put in place

When we had jobs that were to earn
Falling off the edge of the face

I am not allowed to see their face
and testing the edge and gravity

I hear it between bills and stuff
