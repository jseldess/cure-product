('we', 'elections')

between bills and stuffed animals
on my way to elections

Though we are waiting for her
formerly my way to the elections

I answered what I thought
on a way to the elections

formerly along time they were on
formerly along my say to the elections

time they were on
formally a way to the elections

we ask say in that case
My say to the elections

wealth and the pace of digestion
I stay the right of my elections

in the long time they were on
