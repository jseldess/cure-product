('we', 'extension')

between bills and stuffed animals
And as an extension of the values

When we had jobs that were to earn
I tried to feel the extension of key values

I hear it between bills and stuff
when trying to feel the extension of key values

I argued the days were longer
As an extension of the values

The days were long
