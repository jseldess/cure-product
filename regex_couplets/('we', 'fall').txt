('we', 'fall')

between bills and stuffed animals
Then fall then summer from my face

Before we walk across the wide opening
and not falling at all

before we can have a retroactive
Then fall then summer

When we had jobs that were to earn
Face falling off the edge of the face

I am not allowed to see their face
falling off the encoded end

I can hear it between bills and stuff
I take it out in the snow fall

I can hear them between bills and stuff
falling off the end of the world

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
