('we', 'feel')

between bills and stuffed animals
conversations with our feelings

before we can have a retroactive
conversation with our feelings

in light of learning what we see
does not feel an exception

When we had jobs that were to earn
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I am not allowed to see their face
I tried to feel the extension of key values

I hear it between bills and stuff
when trying to feel the extension of key values

I argued the days were longer
What would I feel without that goal

I can hear it between bills and stuff
But my not feeling the memory aside

though we are still breaking in
But my not feeling the memory inside

between the drug store and the 
which feels most comfortable

Though we are waiting 
which feels more comfortable

formerly a long time they were on
which is what feels most comfortable

by the sight of the hosting answered about
which I feel formerly about for

washed I answered about
By my feeling the memory inside

I answered what I thought
But my feeling the memory aside

at least for the duration of the answer
