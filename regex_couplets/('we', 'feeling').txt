('we', 'feeling')

between bills and stuffed animals
conversations with our feelings

before we can have a retroactive
conversation with our feelings

in light of learning what we see
But my not feeling the memory aside

though we are still breaking in
But my not feeling the memory inside

between the drug store and the 
By my feeling the memory inside

I answered what I thought
But my feeling the memory aside

at least for the duration of the answer
