('we', 'form')

between bills and stuffed animals
There are performance reviews

When we had jobs that were to earn
Toward the start informally given my reasons

while we’re wrapped in static
already formerly a long time

I have a memory between the day
in the form filled offered in trust

Though we are waiting for her
dawn already formerly nights 

formerly a long time they were on
A way formerly like this one

though we are breaking in the space that it had
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

Though we are breaking 
already formely a long time

between the drug store and the 
dawn formerly

for the duration of the answer
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

and relive from burrowed travels
with dawn already formerly nights 

answered about 
in the form filled offered trust

I answered about
which I feel formerly about for

washed I answered about
in the form filled offered must

Where did we lose trust
formerly along time they were on

we ask say in that case
formerly a way

I answered what I thought
shone formerly a long time

time they were on
drawn formerly a long time

between tracked and buffered
addition were filters formerly

I answered what I thought about
shone formerly along time

formerly along the time they were on
own best form

that they were visible
own best form to ourselves

tracked between buffered and sizes
