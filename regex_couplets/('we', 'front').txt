('we', 'front')

between bills and stuffed animals
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

my desires were open
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

I am not allowed to see their face
in front of the set afternoon

into the well controlled climate
in front of the set of regulations

I argued the days were longer
And need out in front purchase

Sweets and coffee and juice
And read out in front

And we had to say goodbye to her there
behind or out front or up above

in the long time they were on
