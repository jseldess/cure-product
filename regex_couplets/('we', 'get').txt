('we', 'get')

between bills and stuffed animals
I’ll get there eventually

Before we walk across the wide field
and is relentlessly budgeted

When we had jobs that were to earn
I’ll get there ruins

I hear it between bills and stuff
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

I am not allowed to see their face
I get through there

they were on
I get from here through there

we had to say goodbye
forgetting decisions 

Though we are waiting for her
forgettable

that they were divisible
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I assumed that they were divisible
and maybe forgettable
