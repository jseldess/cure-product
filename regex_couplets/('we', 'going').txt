('we', 'going')

between bills and stuffed animals
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Before we walk across the wide field
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I can hear it between bills and stuff
The way that she is going

though we are breaking in the space that it had
The way that I am going

Though we are waiting for her
The way that I was going

Though we can’t help waiting
way I was going 

I answered what I thought
