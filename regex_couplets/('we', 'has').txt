('We', 'has')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
conversations with our purchase

We can wrestle them with their goals
It has been since

We had to say goodbye there
And need out in front purchase

We had to buy there
For an ungraspable purchase

We had inhabited actually
if that has anything

We got paid one way by a voice
I have entered my purchases

We ask say in that case
phase decisioned by the prospect
