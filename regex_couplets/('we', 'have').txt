('we', 'have')

between bills and stuffed animals
I have entered my phone

Before we walk across the wide opening
before we can have a retroactive

in light of learning what we see
as long as I have access to the code

When we had jobs that were to earn
if you have providence to excess

my desires were open
If you have confidence regardless all else

while weâ€™re wrapped in static
I have them lost

in the long time they were on
I have supporters

I tell you the weight of my purchases
I have a memory between the day

And we could inhabit the room easy
I have entered my purposes

which we can pronounce
I have entered my purchases

though we are still breaking in
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

answered about 
I have turned it off

I answered what I thought
I have them trust in me

The weight kept moaned impression
I have seen more than I can remember

I assumed that they were divisible
Or can have seen offering possession
