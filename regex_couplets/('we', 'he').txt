('We', 'he')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Where I sleep at times

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

We can wrestle them with their goals
We can rest there in them with their goals

We had to say goodbye there
under the grasp principle

We had to buy there
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

We had inhabited actually
And we could inhabit the room easy

We got paid one way by a voice
only in the case

We ask say in that case
buy in the sound privacy
