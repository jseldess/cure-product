('we', 'head')

between bills and stuffed animals
Without a head

When we had jobs that were to earn
I brought my head down

my desires were open
I search with my head

I wish my desires were open
and the graph ahead of me

and could be mapped and weighed
with my head

I hear it between bills and stuff
into the next level head

into the well controlled climate
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
