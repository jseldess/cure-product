('we', 'hear')

between bills and stuffed animals
You can hear it also through your leisure

When we had jobs that were to earn
and my heart rate

my desires were open
Spinning around the heart

I wish my desires were open
I hear it between bills and stuff

I am not allowed to see their face
I can hear it between bills and stuff

I can hear them between bills and stuff
that I can hear

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
there was no television to hear

I cannot hear it between bills
You can hear it also through static leisure

while weâ€™re wrapped in static
In my heart did I lose trust

Where did we lose trust
