('we', 'her')

between bills and stuffed animals
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Before we walk across the wide field
I’ll get there eventually

So I went back to sleep
Of course there is a direction

before we can have a retroactive
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
One day there is direction

When we had jobs that were to earn
To neither study

my desires were open
Where I put it beating

I wish my desires were open
higher up in the results

I hear it between bills and stuff
I’ll pull myself higher up

I am not allowed to see their face
there was no promotion

into the well controlled climate
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
that potential is there for you

The days were long
but would I love her the same

I can hear it between bills and stuff
there was no walking along the pleasure

I can hear them between bills and stuff
Where I take my liesure

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
there was no television to hear

I cannot hear it between bills
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

while we’re wrapped in static
I get through there

they were on
I get from here through there

we had to say goodbye
And we had to say goodbye to her there

Sweets and coffee and juice
We had to say goodbye there

Sweets and coffee
We had to buy there

Under the last principle of purchasing power
where I need gravity

I tell you the weight of my purchases
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

While we’re up in the sky 
there wasn’t any television 

I wear suspenders
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

And from a weak distance
There are spots waiting

They can be weighed
One was up where it should be down

I tell you the weight of my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity

Is the weight of my purchases
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

weight of my purposes
without any further damage

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
here is the site of the battle of maldon

we had inhabited actually
Though we are waiting for her

between that day
Where in me did I host

formerly a long time they were on
if there is anything 

I have a memory between the day
Where I host my purposes

which we can pronounce
where I send and relive aside

though we are still breaking in
where I send and relive would be held

Though we are breaking 
where I stand and relive

between the drug store and the 
where I am aside at least

for the duration of the answer
the point where I am

and relive from burrowed travels
where I send and relive

the duration of answers
where I end and relive

for the duration of answers
where I blend and relive

Though we are waiting 
I presume to others

answered about 
Where in me did I lose

by the sight of the hosting answered about
Where in me did I loose

I answered about
By my memory elsewhere

washed I answered about
after though there’s no memory

Where did we lose trust
with her waves

Though we can’t help waiting
with her way to the ends

Though we can’t help waiting for her
with her way

I answered what I thought
where rights ended themselves

time they were on
where I end

burrowed about from repeated travels
where I stand and retrieve and relive

at least for the duration of the answer
in memory elsewhere

in the long time they were on
but for memory elsewhere

They were filters
where lights blended themselves

formerly along time they were on
Cereal and others’ health

wealth and the pace of digestion
my ethereal economic relations

in welfare and hope
I learned the point where I am

The weight kept moaned impression
where the tongue rippled

that they were visible
The prospects there already

we ask say in that case
The offers there already

between the preambles
traffick is there nonetheless

careening between the preambles
I assume possession to others
