('We', 'here')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Where I sleep at times

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Of course there is a direction

We can wrestle them with their goals
We can rest there in them with their goals

We had to say goodbye there
We had to buy there

We had inhabited actually
Where in me did I host

We got paid one way by a voice
and elsewhere my memory of you

We ask say in that case
The prospects there already
