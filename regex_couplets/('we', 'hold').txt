('we', 'hold')

between bills and stuffed animals
I take hold of my finger

When we had jobs that were to earn
When they really take hold of my finger

I wish my desires were open
hold at intervals riding forward

and could be mapped and weighed
Since I had to hold the entire company

I argued the days were longer
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

The days were long
and hold and wish to hold

in the long time they were on
designed to hold up my underwear

I designed them to hold up my underwear
that hold and wish to hold

And from a weak distance
