('We', 'if')

We’ll have coffee this morning
drifting away

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
if not directly on my skin

We can wrestle them with their goals
drifting does not feel an exception

We had to say goodbye there
if there is anything 

We had inhabited actually
if you have providence

We ask say in that case
if only on the way to the trash
