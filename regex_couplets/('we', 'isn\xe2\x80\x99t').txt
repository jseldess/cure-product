('we', 'isn\xe2\x80\x99t')

between bills and stuffed animals
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

Before we walk across the wide field
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
The sun isn’t up 

Before we walk across the wide opening
The edge isn’t even there

When we had jobs that were to earn
Then the sun isn’t available

my desires were open
Then the sun isn’t up

I wish my desires were open
but the sun isn’t up

I am not allowed to see their face
