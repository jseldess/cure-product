('we', 'last')

between bills and stuffed animals
What was the last time

I can hear them between bills and stuff
under the last seen principle

we had to say goodbye
Under the last principle of purchasing power

And we had to say goodbye to her there
Under the last principle

Sweets and coffee and juice
Where in me did I last

Though we are breaking
last night

Though we are waiting
