('we', 'little')

between bills and stuffed animals
with little reason to move

The days were long
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
with little reasons to aspiration

The days were long aligned
aspirating with little visions

I hear it between bills and stuff
I aspirate with little vision

I can hear it between bills and stuff
I swayed a little in my state

in the long time they were on
