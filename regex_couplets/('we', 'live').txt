('we', 'live')

between bills and stuffed animals
Which is a measure to never live out

When we had jobs that were to earn
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

while weâ€™re wrapped in static
Which is a pleasure to never live out

which we can pronounce
where I send and relive aside

though we are still breaking in
where I send and relive would be held

Though we are breaking 
where I stand and relive

between the drug store and the 
where I send and retrieve relive

and relive from burrowed travels
where I send and relive

the duration of answers
where I end and relive

for the duration of answers
where I blend and relive

Though we are waiting 
where I stand and retrieve relive

for the duration of the answer
where I stand and retrieve and relive

at least for the duration of the answer
