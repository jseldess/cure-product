('We', 'man')

We’ll have coffee this morning
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

We had to say goodbye there
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

We had inhabited actually
They have very many choices

We ask say in that case
