('we', 'measure')

between bills and stuffed animals
Which is a measure to never live out

When we had jobs that were to earn
If I take a different measure

I can hear it between bills and stuff
walking along the measure

I can hear them between bills and stuff
If I take some different measure

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
