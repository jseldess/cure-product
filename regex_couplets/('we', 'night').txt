('we', 'night')

between bills and stuffed animals
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

Before we walk across the wide field
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

So I went back to sleep
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Before we walk across the wide opening
blue and sun again a second, then night

I am not allowed to see their face
I had nightmares though

The days were long
dawn already formerly nights 

formerly a long time they were on
last night

Though we are waiting 
with dawn already formerly nights 

Though we are waiting for her
battery dawn nights 

I answered what I thought
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in the long time they were on
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

time they were on
