('we', 'nights')

between bills and stuffed animals
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Before we walk across the wide opening
dawn already formerly nights 

formerly a long time they were on
with dawn already formerly nights 

Though we are waiting for her
battery dawn nights 

I answered what I thought
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in the long time they were on
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

time they were on
