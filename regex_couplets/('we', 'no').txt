('we', 'no')

between bills and stuffed animals
Then I cannot see face value

Before we walk across the wide field
asynchronous 

So I went back to sleep
on a snow day with my children

Before we walk across the wide opening
who knows the way

before we can have a retroactive
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice
if not directly on my skin

When we had jobs that were to earn
not one virtue to excess

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
for not voting for him

when we had jobs that was to churn some bread
Which can be pronounced to the world

my desires were open
But not to me directly

I wish my desires were open
in a continuous vertiginous dream

and could be mapped and weighed
not back in the results

I hear it between bills and stuff
I’ll pull myself another personality type

I am not allowed to see their face
of the economic value

into the well controlled climate
increasingly that their economic value

I argued the days were longer
that their economic value 

I agrued the days were longer
there was no promotion

The days were long
I take it out in the snow fall

I can hear it between bills and stuff
there was no walking along the pleasure

I can hear them between bills and stuff
may not be engrained

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills
Though in not many acts

While we’re up in the sky
Though it is not a simple act

while we’re wrapped in static
until I could not be hired

wearing trying talking into it
even when close to my knowing

we had to say goodbye
I used my technology

And from a weak distance
that nothing had gravity

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

we had inhabited actually
The sun high enough to enter directly

which we can pronounce
But my not feeling the memory aside

though we are still breaking in
not speaking

Though we are waiting for her
But my not feeling the memory inside

between the drug store and the 
from no one point

for the duration of the answer
not needing to wait

and relive from burrowed travels
knowing the constituents

Though we are waiting 
and it’s not literal

formerly a long time they were on
not literally moved about

washed I answered about
after though there’s no memory

Where did we lose trust
It’s not marshal exactly

Though we can’t help waiting
It’s not marshall exactly

I answered what I thought
But my not 

I answered about
between cereal and economic

in welfare and hope
Aligned or not with my interests

in the long time they were on
that their knowing

The weight kept moaned impression
in that I cannot remember 

that they were visible
which is not necessarily possible

we ask say in that case
for a while not to listen

careening between the preambles
The sun high enough to strike directly

I assumed that they were divisible
