('We', 'nor')

We’ll have coffee this morning
into the minority proportion of time

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
over the long line I would honor

We had to say goodbye there
nor work in this way daily

We got paid one way by a voice
nor envy honest work

We ask say in that case
