('We', 'now')

We’ll have coffee this morning
On a snow day with my children

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
who knows the way

We can wrestle them with their goals
Though how can you know without direction

We had to say goodbye there
knowing the constituents

We ask say in that case
