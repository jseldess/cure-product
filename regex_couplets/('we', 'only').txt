('we', 'only')

between bills and stuffed animals
only fragments of time with my children

When we had jobs that were to earn
only in the case

my desires were open
So that I notice I am the only one

I am not allowed to see their face
then I can see only the back values

into the well controlled climate
The planning process is for visionaries only

I hear it between bills and stuff
would only willingly break

Though we are waiting 
if only on the way to the trash

between the preambles
I only think I donâ€™t listen

careening between the preambles
less only money

between the preamble
