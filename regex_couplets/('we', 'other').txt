('we', 'other')

between bills and stuffed animals
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Before we walk across the wide field
others desires

When we had jobs that were to earn
On the other hand

I can hear them between bills and stuff
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

we had to say goodbye
and other types of tracking technology

which we can pronounce
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

though we are still breaking in
I presume to others

Though we are waiting for her
to the other end

Though we can’t help waiting
the other end transactions

I answered what I thought
Cereal and others’ health

wealth and the pace of digestion
I assume possession to others
