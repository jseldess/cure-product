('we', 'over')

between bills and stuffed animals
I step over the edge

When we had jobs that were to earn
hovering above standing water

I hear it between bills and stuff
over the long time up in the sky

I am not allowed to see their face
oddly grown over with historic bark

into the well controlled climate
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

while weâ€™re wrapped in static
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

we had to say goodbye
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

though we are still breaking in
for not paying sound overwhelmed

Though we are waiting 
over the hooves and buildings across the alley

I assumed that they were divisible
