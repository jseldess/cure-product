('we', 'presume')

between bills and stuffed animals
and canâ€™t presume to need

When we had jobs that were to earn
I continue to presume

we had to say goodbye
I presume to others

Though we are waiting for her
So I presume the offers already

we ask say in that case
I presume the offers

between the private ambles
So I presume the offers

careening between the preambles
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
