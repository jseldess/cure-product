('we', 'principle')

between bills and stuffed animals
under the last seen principle

we had to say goodbye
Under the last principle of purchasing power

And we had to say goodbye to her there
under the grasp principle

Sweets and coffee
Under the past principle

Sweets and coffee and juice
Under the grass principle

And from a weak distance
