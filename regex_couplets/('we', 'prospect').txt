('we', 'prospect')

between bills and stuffed animals
the impulse for my own prospects

though we are still breaking in
the impulse my own prospects

Though we are breaking 
stopping into the prospect

Though we are waiting for her
speech that is of by prospects

we ask say in that case
step in by the prospect

between tracked and buffered
decisioned by the prospect

tracked between buffered and sizes
The prospects there already

between the private ambles
the prospects being seen by me

between the preambles
The prospect for careening attached

between the preamble
The prospect for veering healthily

that they were divisible
