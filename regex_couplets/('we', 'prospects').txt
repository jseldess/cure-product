('we', 'prospects')

between bills and stuffed animals
the impulse for my own prospects

though we are still breaking in
the impulse my own prospects

Though we are breaking 
speech that is of by prospects

we ask say in that case
The prospects there already

between tracked and buffered
the prospects being seen by me

between the preambles
