('we', 'purchase')

between bills and stuffed animals
conversations with our purchase

before we can have a retroactive
in traversing my purchase

I can hear it between bills and stuff
purchased out

we had to say goodbye
Having been purchased out of you

And we had to say goodbye to her there
for an ungraspable purchase

Sweets and coffee and juice
And need out in front purchase

Under the last principle of purchasing power
I tell you the weight of my purchases

While weâ€™re up in the sky
my purchase up in the sky

I wear suspenders
until I purchase up the sky

designed to hold up my underwear
until I purchase the sky

They can be weighed
Is the weight of my purchases

Is the weight of my click or zipcode
I have entered my purchases

which we can pronounce
the impulse for my own purchases

though we are still breaking in
for my own purchases

though we are breaking in the space that it had
found dated for my own purchases

Though we are breaking 
impulse for my own purchases

between the drug store and the 
converting sight into a purchase

though we are waiting for her
at the site of a purchase

in the long time they were on
