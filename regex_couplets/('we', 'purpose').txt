('we', 'purpose')

between bills and stuffed animals
by no ventillation my purpose

When we had jobs that were to earn
until my purpose up in the sky

I am not allowed to see their face
until I purpose the horizon

wearing trying talking into it
of my purpose in versing

they were on
in traversing my purpose

in the long time they were on
in conversing of my purpose

we had to say goodbye
My purpose up in the sky

Sweets and coffee and juice
Until my purpose 

And we had to say goodbye to her there
I tell you my purposes

I tell you the weight of my purchases
until I purpose up in the sky

While weâ€™re up in the sky
I tell you the weight of my purposes

weight of my purposes
Where I host my purposes

which we can pronounce
the impulse for my own purposes

though we are still breaking in
the impulse to my purpose

between the drug store and the 
to the other end of my purpose

I answered what I thought
aside the impulse to my purpose

for the duration of the answer
for my own purposes

The weight kept moaned impression
