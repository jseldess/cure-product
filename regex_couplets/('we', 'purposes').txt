('we', 'purposes')

between bills and stuffed animals
I tell you my purposes

I tell you the weight of my purchases
I tell you the weight of my purposes

weight of my purposes
Where I host my purposes

which we can pronounce
the impulse for my own purposes

though we are still breaking in
for my own purposes

in the long time they were on
