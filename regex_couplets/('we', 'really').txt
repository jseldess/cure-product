between bills and stuffed animals
because it was really dark

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
it was really sunny

So I went back to sleep
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

When they really take hold of my finger

I wish my desires were open
That’s when they really take

without really breaking

between the drug store and the 
without really branding 

Though we are waiting 
without really binding

formerly a long time they were on
without really needing

answered about 
also didn’t really move

I answered about
