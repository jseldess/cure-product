('we', 'reason')

between bills and stuffed animals
reasons resources

Before we walk across the wide field
with reasons

When we had jobs that were to earn
with little reason to move

The days were long
with little reasons to aspiration

I argued that the days were longer
with little reasons to move

The days were long aligned
with little reason to aspiration

I hear it between bills and stuff
embodied with little reason

I can hear it between bills and stuff
Toward the start informally given my reasons

while weâ€™re wrapped in static
More reasons around my country 

which we can pronounce
and could be inflected with reasons

we ask say in that case
