('we', 'resume')

between bills and stuffed animals
and can’t presume to need

When we had jobs that were to earn
I resume unassimilable visions

I can hear it between bills and stuff
I resume indelible tracks

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
I resume attributable visions

while we’re wrapped in static
I continue to presume

we had to say goodbye
I presume to others

Though we are waiting for her
So I presume the offers already

we ask say in that case
I presume the offers

between the private ambles
So I resume the offers already

careening between the preambles
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
