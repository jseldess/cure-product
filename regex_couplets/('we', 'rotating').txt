('We', 'rotating')

We’ll have coffee this morning
into rotating directionless 

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
Rather it itself is rotating

We can wrestle them with their goals
into rotating and directionless space

We can rest there in them with their goals
and then into rotating and directional space

We had to say goodbye there
