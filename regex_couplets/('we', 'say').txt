('we', 'say')

between bills and stuffed animals
we had to say goodbye

Under the last principle of purchasing power
And we had to say goodbye to her there

Sweets and coffee and juice
We had to say goodbye there

Sweets and coffee
I ask say in that case

Though we are waiting for her
we ask say in that case

between tracked and buffered
formerly along my say to the elections

I answered what I thought
I ask say in that phase decisioned

tracked between buffered and sizes
My say to the elections

wealth and the pace of digestion
