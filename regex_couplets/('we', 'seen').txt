('we', 'seen')

between bills and stuffed animals
under the last seen principle

we had to say goodbye
Having seen more than 

Though we are waiting for her
being seen by me

between the preambles
Having seen more than I can remember 

I assumed that they were divisible
Or can have seen offering possession
