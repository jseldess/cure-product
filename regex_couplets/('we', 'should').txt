('We', 'should')

We’ll have coffee this morning
You should ask who I am

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
While I should be sleeping

We had to say goodbye there
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

We had inhabited actually
they should rise up

We ask say in that case
