('We', 'side')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Whereas direction is beside the point

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

We can wrestle them with their goals
aside from the retinas

We had to say goodbye there
But my not feeling the memory aside

We ask say in that case
