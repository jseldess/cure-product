('we', 'sky')

between bills and stuffed animals
over the long time up in the sky

When we had jobs that were to earn
Blue sky or

my desires were open
over the long line up in the sky

I am not allowed to see their face
though not many facts up in the sky

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I resume indelible tracks up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills
and stuff up in the sky

While we’re up in the sky
Up in the sky

Sweets and coffee and juice
My purpose up in the sky

And we had to say goodbye to her there
While they’re up in the sky

I tell you the weight of my purchases
until I purpose up in the sky

I wear suspenders
until I purchase up the sky

designed to hold up my underwear
until I purchase the sky

They can be weighed
