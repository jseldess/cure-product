('we', 'sleep')

between bills and stuffed animals
where I sleep at times

Before we walk across the wide field
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

So I went back to sleep
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
That’s where I sleep at times

When we had jobs that were to earn
Interrupted sleep or

my desires were open
While I should be sleeping 

I wish my desires were open
Looking back while I should be sleeping

and could be mapped and weighed
While I should sleep not back in the results

I hear it between bills and stuff
like flattening sleep 

wearing trying talking into it
like sleep

they were on
