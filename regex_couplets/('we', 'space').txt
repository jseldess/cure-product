('We', 'space')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
in rotating directionless space

We can wrestle them with their goals
into rotating and directionless space

We can rest there in them with their goals
and then into rotating and directional space

We had to say goodbye there
in the space that it had

We had inhabited actually
though we are breaking in the space that it had

We ask say in that case
