('we', 'step')

between bills and stuffed animals
I step off the edge

Before we walk across the wide field
I step over the edge

When we had jobs that were to earn
What the next step

I am not allowed to see their face
Whatâ€™s the next step

I hear it between bills and stuff
from which to step off

The days were long aligned
step in by the prospect

between tracked and buffered
phase decision step in

tracked between buffered and sizes
step by into the prospect

we ask say in that case
stepping in the middle

careening between the preambles
stepping off into the middle

that they were divisible
stepping off in to the middle
