('we', 'still')

between bills and stuffed animals
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Before we walk across the wide field
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

 wonder about all the ways we connect. 
That is itself not still

When we had jobs that were to earn
I love my daughter still

I can hear it between bills and stuff
though we are still breaking in

Though we are waiting for her
still wash conserving

answered about
so still them

Where did we lose trust
