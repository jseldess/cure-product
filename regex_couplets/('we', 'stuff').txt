('we', 'stuff')

between bills and stuffed animals
I hear it between bills and stuff

I am not allowed to see their face
I can hear it between bills and stuff

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

I cannot hear it between bills
and stuff up in the sky

While weâ€™re up in the sky
bills and stuffed animals

between the private ambles
