('We', 'tell')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Then I constellate my time family country

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
So I constellate the time family country

We had to say goodbye there
I tell you my purposes

We had inhabited actually
and that man comes on to tell me 

We ask say in that case
