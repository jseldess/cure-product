('we', 'themselves')

between bills and stuffed animals
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Before we walk across the wide opening
talking into pheasants bending themselves

I can hear it between bills and stuff
talking into percents bending themselves

wearing trying talking into it
walking into percents blending themselves

they were on
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

and relive from burrowed travels
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

time they were on
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in the long time they were on
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

I answered what I thought
where rights ended themselves

formerly along time they were on
