('we', 'through')

between bills and stuffed animals
You can hear it also through your leisure

When we had jobs that were to earn
Back up through the results

I hear it between bills and stuff
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I cannot clear it also through investiture

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

I cannot hear it between bills
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

while weâ€™re wrapped in static
I get through there

they were on
I get from here through there

we had to say goodbye
