('we', 'track')

between bills and stuffed animals
I reuse indelible tracks 

I can hear it between bills and stuff
The first track

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I refuse indelible tracks

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
in not many tracks up in the sky

I cannot hear it between bills
and other types of tracking technology

which we can pronounce
trackers collecting data on users

though we are still breaking in
which as tracked befitted 

Though we are waiting for her
which as tracked befitted phased

between tracked and buffered
tracked between buffered and sizes

Though we canâ€™t help waiting
sizes track for asking sound

I answered about
sizes asking for tracking sound

between the private ambles
