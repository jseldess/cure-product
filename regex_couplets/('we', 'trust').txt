('we', 'trust')

between bills and stuffed animals
I have them trust in me

in the long time they were on
in the form filled offered in trust

Though we are waiting for her
about the sight hosting trusting

by the sight of the hosting answered about
in the form filled offered trust

answered about 
Where in me did I lose trust

Where did we lose trust
