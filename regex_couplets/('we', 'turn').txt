('We', 'turn')

We’ll have coffee this morning
in a sharp downward turn 

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
In a sharp downard turn

We can wrestle them with their goals
sudden downward turn

We had to say goodbye there
who knows how to turn it off

We ask say in that case
