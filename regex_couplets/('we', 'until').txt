('we', 'until')

between bills and stuffed animals
until my purpose up in the sky

When we had jobs that were to earn
until I could not tire 

I can hear them between bills and stuff
until I could not be tired

while we’re wrapped in static
until I could not be hired

wearing trying talking into it
until I purpose up in the sky

While we’re up in the sky
until I purchase up in the sky

I tell you the weight of my purchases
until I purchase up the sky

I wear suspenders
until I purchase the sky

They can be weighed
until the bill came

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
until a happier time found

Though we are waiting
