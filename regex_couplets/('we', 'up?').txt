('We', 'up?')

We’ll have coffee this morning
Arrayed out in such a nested way

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
No! The sun doesn’t sleep. The sun isn’t up!

We can wrestle them with their goals
there are quarters 

We can rest there in them with their goals
Though how can you know without direction

We had to say goodbye there
articles all around storming around

We had to buy there
Articles all around us

We had inhabited actually
And we could inhabit the room easy

We got paid one way by a voice
If you have confidence regardless all else

We ask say in that case
buy in the sound privacy
