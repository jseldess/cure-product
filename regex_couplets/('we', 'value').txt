('we', 'value')

between bills and stuffed animals
Then I cannot see face value

Before we walk across the wide field
value falling off the edge of the face

Before we walk across the wide opening
And as an extension of the values

When we had jobs that were to earn
The CEO tells me to embody values

I wish my desires were open
The value falling off the edge of th face

I am not allowed to see their face
of the economic value

into the well controlled climate
I tried to feel the extension of key values

I hear it between bills and stuff
and key value

I argued the days were longer
that their economic value 

I agrued the days were longer
As an extension of the values

The days were long
