('we', 'values')

between bills and stuffed animals
And as an extension of the values

When we had jobs that were to earn
The CEO tells me to embody values

I wish my desires were open
I see only the back of falling values

I am not allowed to see their face
then I can see only the back values

into the well controlled climate
I tried to feel the extension of key values

I hear it between bills and stuff
I tried to feel the key values extending 

I argued the days were longer
As an extension of the values

The days were long
