('We', 'visible')

We’ll have coffee this morning
I assumed it was visible

The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

We had to say goodbye there
I assume the offers divisible

We ask say in that case
that they were divisible
