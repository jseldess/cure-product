('we', 'vision')

between bills and stuffed animals
I had me a vision

I hear it between bills and stuff
The planning process for visions

I am not allowed to see their face
The planning process is for visionaries only

into the well controlled climate
aspirating visions

I agrued the days were longer
aspirating with visions

I argued the days were longer
embodied with little visions

The days were long
little visions

The days were long aligned
aspirating with little visions

I can hear it between bills and stuff
I reuse unassimilable visions

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I resume unassimilable visions

I cannot hear it between bills and stuff
there was no television to hear

I cannot hear it between bills
I resume attributable visions

while we’re wrapped in static
The long time I was a vision

wearing trying talking into it
attributable visions

we had to say goodbye
there wasn’t any television 

I wear suspenders
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
joined in my television

I answered about
visions that can be attainable

between the private ambles
revisions that can be attributable

careening between the preambles
