('we', 'visions')

between bills and stuffed animals
The planning process for visions

I am not allowed to see their face
aspirating visions

into the well controlled climate
aspirating with visions

I argued the days were longer
embodied with little visions

The days were long
little visions

The days were long aligned
aspirating with little visions

I hear it between bills and stuff
I reuse unassimilable visions

I can hear it between bills and stuff
I resume unassimilable visions

I can hear them between bills and stuff
I resume attributable visions

while weâ€™re wrapped in static
attributable visions

we had to say goodbye
visions that can be attainable

between the private ambles
revisions that can be attributable

careening between the preambles
