('we', 'waiting')

between bills and stuffed animals
There are spots waiting

While we’re up in the sky
Though we are waiting for her

between that day
Though we are waiting 

formerly a long time they were on
Though we can’t help waiting

Though we can’t help waiting for her
waiting out front or up above 

in the long time they were on
