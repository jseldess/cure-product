between bills and stuffed animals
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

Between the face of pure joy and an interface.
always watching

they were on
deep into pathways from repeated travels

with constant ways 

Though we are waiting for her
with her ways to the ends

Though we canâ€™t help waiting
I end up in Bach with constant ways 

I answered what I thought
