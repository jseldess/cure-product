('we', 'were')

between bills and stuffed animals
When we had jobs that were to earn

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
my desires were open

I wish my desires were open
I argued the days were longer

I hear it between bills and stuff
I agrued the days were longer

The days were long
I argued that the days were longer

The days were long aligned
they were on

in the long time they were on
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

we had inhabited actually
formerly a long time they were on

I have a memory between the day
answered about 

the duration of answers
by the sight of the hosting answered about

I answered about
washed I answered about

Where did we lose trust
formerly along time they were on

we ask say in that case
I answered what I thought

time they were on
I answered while interfaced

They were filters
addition were filters formerly

I answered what I thought about
formerly along the time they were on

wealth and the pace of digestion
that they were visible

between tracked and buffered
that they were divisible

I assumed that they were divisible
