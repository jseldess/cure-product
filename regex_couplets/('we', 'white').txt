('we', 'white')

between bills and stuffed animals
white spots on a black surface

I can hear it between bills and stuff
black spots on a white surface

I can hear them between bills and stuff
a futile joyous white sun

we had to say goodbye
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
