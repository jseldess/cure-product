('we', 'world')

between bills and stuffed animals
off the edge of the world

Before we walk across the wide field
Which can be pronounced to the world

When we had jobs that were to earn
The world 

my desires were open
off the end of the world

into the well controlled climate
hauling off the end of the world

I can hear it between bills and stuff
falling off the end of the world

I can hear them between bills and stuff
the opinions in my world

Though we are waiting
