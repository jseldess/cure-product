('We', 'you.')

Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning
Though how can you know without direction

We had to say goodbye there
I tell you my purposes

We had inhabited actually
You can hear it also through your leisure

We got paid one way by a voice
If you have confidence regardless all else

We ask say in that case
