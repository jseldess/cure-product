('weight', 'he')

I tell you the weight of my purchases
until I purpose up in the sky

I tell you the weight of my purposes
They can be waived

weight of my purposes
They can be weighed

Is the weight of my purchases
Is the weight of my click or zipcode

The weight kept moaned impression
the tongue and hands
