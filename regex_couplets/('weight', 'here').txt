('weight', 'here')

I tell you the weight of my purchases
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I tell you the weight of my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity

Is the weight of my purchases
Where I need gravity

weight of my purposes
here is the site of the battle of maldon

The weight kept moaned impression
where the tongue rippled
