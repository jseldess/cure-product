('weight', 'up?')

I tell you the weight of my purchases
until I purpose up in the sky

I tell you the weight of my purposes
weight of my purposes

Is the weight of my purchases
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Is the weight of my click or zipcode
I captured an afterimage

The weight kept moaned impression
my reflexing indented in my own tongue
