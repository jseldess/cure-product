('were', 'A')

When we had jobs that were to earn
BREAK

my desires were open
A person from a distance

I wish my desires were open
And as an extension of the values

I argued the days were longer
As an extension of the values

The days were long
All that I can think I want

they were on
COPY DREAM 

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

formerly a long time they were on
And we could inhabit the room easy

answered about 
CONTRACT

by the sight of the hosting answered about
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER

formerly along time they were on
A baby and a bear

I answered what I thought
Aligned or not with my interests

I answered about
3 [PASSWORDS]

in the long time they were on
2 â€“ PREAMBLE

that they were visible
All that I own messageable

that they were divisible
