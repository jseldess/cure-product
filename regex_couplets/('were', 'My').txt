('were', 'My')

When we had jobs that were to earn
My associations

The days were long
My purpose up in the sky

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
My daughter with her way

I answered what I thought
My say to the elections

in the long time they were on
My state kept loaned impression

that they were visible
