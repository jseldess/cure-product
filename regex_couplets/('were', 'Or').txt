('were', 'Or')

When we had jobs that were to earn
Or the company

I wish my desires were open
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
Or alter of course the time anyway

formerly a long time they were on
Or can have seen offering possession

I assumed that they were divisible
