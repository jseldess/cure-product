('were', 'so')

When we had jobs that were to earn
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

my desires were open
A person from a distance

I wish my desires were open
or an available resource

I argued the days were longer
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I agrued the days were longer
My associations

The days were long
with little reasons to aspiration

I argued that the days were longer
with little reasons to move

The days were long aligned
with little reason to aspiration

they were on
If I take some different measure

in the long time they were on
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

formerly a long time they were on
I want to cite a poem so usual

answered about 
firing and connecting somewhere

by the sight of the hosting answered about
so still watch them

I answered about
so still them

formerly along time they were on
by in the sound privacy

I answered what I thought
by in the sounded privacy

I answered while interfaced
buy in the sound privacy

that they were visible
and could be inflected with reasons

that they were divisible
