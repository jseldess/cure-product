('were', 'That')

When we had jobs that were to earn
Thatâ€™s when they really take

I wish my desires were open
That you can see only the back of

I argued the days were longer
That company creates a life

The days were long
That I captured an afterimage

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
That are my right to say

in the long time they were on
