('were', 'There')

When we had jobs that were to earn
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

they were on
There are spots waiting

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
There are constant ways

I answered what I thought
