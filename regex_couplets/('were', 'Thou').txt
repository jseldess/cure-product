('were', 'Thou')

When we had jobs that were to earn
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

they were on
Though we are waiting for her

formerly a long time they were on
Though we are breaking 

answered about 
Though we are waiting 

by the sight of the hosting answered about
Though we can’t help waiting

I answered what I thought
