('were', 'though')

When we had jobs that were to earn
I had nightmares though

The days were long
though not many freeze up

they were on
I thought

formerly a long time they were on
though it was most emphatically that

answered about 
after though thereâ€™s no memory

formerly along time they were on
though we are waiting for her

I answered what I thought
I answered what I thought about

in the long time they were on
