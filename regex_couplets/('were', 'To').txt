('were', 'To')

When we had jobs that were to earn
To neither study

my desires were open
To that impossible place

I argued the days were longer
Tomorrow

they were on
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

answered about 
To the ends of transactions

formerly along time they were on
To the ends of my transactions

I answered what I thought
To the right of determined elections

in the long time they were on
