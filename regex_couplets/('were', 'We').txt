('were', 'We')

When we had jobs that were to earn
We had to say goodbye there

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
We had inhabited actually

formerly a long time they were on
We got paid one way by a voice

answered about 
We ask say in that case

that they were visible
