('were', 'what')

When we had jobs that were to earn
I invited most of what came next

The days were long
I even know what I would find

they were on
what literally moved

answered about 
which is what feels most comfortable

by the sight of the hosting answered about
In what part did I lose trust

formerly along time they were on
I answered what I thought

time they were on
I assumed what I draw

I answered about
I answered what I thought about

in the long time they were on
to return what I bought

that they were visible
