('were', 'Where')

When we had jobs that were to earn
Where official policy is to catch and release

my desires were open
Where I put it beating

I wish my desires were open
Where I take my liesure

they were on
Where I lead gravity

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
Where in me did I host

formerly a long time they were on
Where I host my purposes

answered about 
Where in me did I lose

by the sight of the hosting answered about
Where in me did I loose

I answered about
Where in me pre-worn

formerly along time they were on
