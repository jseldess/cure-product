('were', 'while')

When we had jobs that were to earn
Looking back while I should be sleeping

I wish my desires were open
at intervals while riding forward

I argued the days were longer
while wrapped in static

they were on
while consuming damage

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
I answered while interfaced

I answered what I thought
for a while to listen already

that they were divisible
