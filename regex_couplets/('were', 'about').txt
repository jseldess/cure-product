('were', 'about')

When we had jobs that were to earn
burrowed about from repeated travels

answered about 
and literally moved about

formerly a long time they were on
about the site

by the sight of the hosting answered about
I answered about

washed I answered about
which I feel formerly about for

in the long time they were on
I answered what I thought about

I answered what I thought
about 

that they were visible
