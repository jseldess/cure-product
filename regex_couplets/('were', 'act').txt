('were', 'act')

When we had jobs that were to earn
I was enjoined to act again

I argued the days were longer
I was enjoying acting against myself

I agrued the days were longer
I am bid to act again

The days were long
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
I am enjoined to act again

The days were long aligned
actually considering the end

they were on
we had inhabited actually

formerly a long time they were on
The ends of my transactions

answered about 
to the ends of my transactions

by the sight of the hosting answered about
To the ends of transactions

formerly along time they were on
to the ends of actions

I answered what I thought
I turn not sad exactly

I answered about
I return not sad exactly

in the long time they were on
before I act on them

that they were divisible
