('were', 'agreed')

When we had jobs that were to earn
and to which I’ve agreed

formerly a long time they were on
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

answered about 
and for which the plan agreed

by the sight of the hosting answered about
that agreed one of rest

I answered what I thought
that agreed home

that they were visible
that agreed to one the people

that they were divisible
