('were', 'along')

When we had jobs that were to earn
The days lined along company

The days were long
there was no walking along the pleasure

they were on
formerly along time they were on

I answered what I thought
formerly along my say to the elections

time they were on
along cables

I answered about
shone formerly along time

formerly along the time they were on
