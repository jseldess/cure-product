('were', 'already')

When we had jobs that were to earn
already formerly a long time

formerly a long time they were on
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

answered about 
with dawn already formerly nights 

by the sight of the hosting answered about
dawn already formerly nights 

formerly along time they were on
So I presume the offers already

that they were divisible
