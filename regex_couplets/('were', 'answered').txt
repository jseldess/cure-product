('were', 'answered')

When we had jobs that were to earn
answered about 

formerly a long time they were on
by the sight of the hosting answered about

I answered about
washed I answered about

formerly along time they were on
I answered what I thought

time they were on
I answered while interfaced

They were filters
I answered what I thought about

in the long time they were on
