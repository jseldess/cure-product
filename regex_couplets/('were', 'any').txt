('were', 'any')

When we had jobs that were to earn
Or the company

I wish my desires were open
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I argued the days were longer
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I agrued the days were longer
The entire company

The days were long
The days aligned for company

I argued that the days were longer
The days aligned long company

The days were long aligned
That company creates a life

they were on
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
or alter of course the time anyway

formerly a long time they were on
if there is anything 

answered about 
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

by the sight of the hosting answered about
The many transparent pixel calls

I answered what I thought
or imagined anyway

in the long time they were on
