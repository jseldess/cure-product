('were', 'assume')

When we had jobs that were to earn
I assumed 

formerly a long time they were on
I assumed what I draw

formerly along time they were on
I assume the offers reliable

that they were visible
I assume the offers revisitable

that they were divisible
I assumed that they were divisible
