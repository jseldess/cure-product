('were', 'attributable')

When we had jobs that were to earn
I resume attributable visions

they were on
attributable visions

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
that decisions can be attributable

I answered what I thought
decisions that can be attributable

that they were visible
revisions that can be attributable

that they were divisible
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I assumed that they were divisible
