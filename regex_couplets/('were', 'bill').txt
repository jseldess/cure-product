('were', 'bill')

When we had jobs that were to earn
I hear it between bills and stuff

I argued the days were longer
I can hear it between bills and stuff

they were on
until the bill came

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
the bill my detuning 

in the long time they were on
between bills and stuffed animals

that they were visible
bills and stuffed animals

that they were divisible
