('were', 'but')

When we had jobs that were to earn
Attributable or

my desires were open
but the sun isnâ€™t up

I argued the days were longer
but it continued

The days were long
but it continued rippling muscle

The days were long aligned
but would I love her the same

they were on
I resume attributable visions

in the long time they were on
attributable visions

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
that decisions can be attributable

I answered what I thought
but for memory elsewhere

They were filters
but standing in memory

time they were on
decisions that can be attributable

that they were visible
revisions that can be attributable

that they were divisible
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I assumed that they were divisible
