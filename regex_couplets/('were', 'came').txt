('were', 'came')

When we had jobs that were to earn
I invited most of what came next

The days were long
I came back to me

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
and came home to rewind inflections

that they were divisible
and came home to rewind

I assumed that they were divisible
