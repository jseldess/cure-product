('were', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

When we had jobs that were to earn
That can’t be glimpsed

I argued the days were longer
Though we can’t help waiting

I answered what I thought
I can’t remember them

in the long time they were on
terms in that possessive can’t be remembered

I assumed that they were divisible
