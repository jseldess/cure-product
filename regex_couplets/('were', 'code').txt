('were', 'code')

When we had jobs that were to earn
May I have your zip code

my desires were open
I spend time online learning to code

I wish my desires were open
learned without too much difficulty to code

I argued the days were longer
falling off the encoded end

they were on
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
zipcode

I answered what I thought
