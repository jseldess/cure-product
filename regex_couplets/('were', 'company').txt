('were', 'company')

When we had jobs that were to earn
Or the company

I wish my desires were open
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I argued the days were longer
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I agrued the days were longer
The entire company

The days were long
The days aligned for company

I argued that the days were longer
The days aligned long company

The days were long aligned
That company creates a life

they were on
