('were', 'could')

When we had jobs that were to earn
and could be mapped and weighed

I wish my desires were open
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

I argued the days were longer
until I could not tire 

they were on
I could in effect credit

in the long time they were on
I could consume the dream

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
and we could inhabit the room easy

formerly a long time they were on
and could be inflected with reasons

that they were divisible
