('were', 'decision')

When we had jobs that were to earn
the planning process for decisions

I argued the days were longer
attributable decisions

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
forgetting decisions 

formerly a long time they were on
decisioned to learn 

I answered what I thought
decisioned to learn back

I answered about
decisions that can be attributable

that they were visible
decisioned by the prospect

that they were divisible
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I assumed that they were divisible
