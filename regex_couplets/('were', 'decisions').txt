('were', 'decisions')

When we had jobs that were to earn
the planning process for decisions

I argued the days were longer
attributable decisions

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
forgetting decisions 

formerly a long time they were on
that decisions can be attributable

I answered what I thought
decisions that can be attributable

that they were visible
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I assumed that they were divisible
