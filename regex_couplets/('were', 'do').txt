('were', 'do')

When we had jobs that were to earn
I brought my head down

my desires were open
the dogs and lillies

I wish my desires were open
which I brought down with qualities

I argued the days were longer
What I do in my liesure

they were on
here is the site of the battle of maldon

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

formerly a long time they were on
and it doesn’t take long

answered about 
latency which doesn’t mean anything

by the sight of the hosting answered about
I only think I don’t listen

that they were divisible
