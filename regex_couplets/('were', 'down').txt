('were', 'down')

When we had jobs that were to earn
I brought my head down

my desires were open
which I brought down with qualities

I wish my desires were open
I brought my qualities down

I argued the days were longer
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
