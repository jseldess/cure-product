('were', 'else')

When we had jobs that were to earn
If you have confidence regardless all else

my desires were open
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
and elsewhere my memory

answered about 
elsewhere by my memory

I answered about
By my memory elsewhere

washed I answered about
in memory elsewhere

in the long time they were on
but for memory elsewhere

I answered what I thought
in memory persisting elsewhere

They were filters
