('were', 'front')

When we had jobs that were to earn
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

my desires were open
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

I argued the days were longer
And need out in front purchase

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
behind or out front or up above

in the long time they were on
