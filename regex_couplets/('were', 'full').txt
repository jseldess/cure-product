('were', 'full')

When we had jobs that were to earn
I am full of potential

The days were long
with full potential to movement

I argued that the days were longer
full of aspirations

The days were long aligned
full of potential

they were on
full of the missing words

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
still carefully
