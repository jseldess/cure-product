('were', 'get')

When we had jobs that were to earn
I’ll get there eventually

my desires were open
I’ll get there ruins

I argued the days were longer
I get through there

they were on
I get from here through there

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
forgetting decisions 

formerly a long time they were on
forgettable

that they were divisible
forgetting decisions that can be attributable

I assumed that they were divisible
and maybe forgettable
