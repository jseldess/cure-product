('were', 'Having')

When we had jobs that were to earn
Having transitioned from leisure to work

I argued the days were longer
Having been purchased out of you

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
Having seen more than 

formerly a long time they were on
Having seen more than I can remember 

I assumed that they were divisible
