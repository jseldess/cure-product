('were', 'he')

When we had jobs that were to earn
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

my desires were open
Out of the remnants 

I wish my desires were open
and could be mapped and weighed

I argued the days were longer
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I agrued the days were longer
when watching tv

The days were long
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
or argued for them at least

The days were long aligned
The days aligned long company

they were on
I get through there

in the long time they were on
I have them lost

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

formerly a long time they were on
if there is anything 

answered about 
from cables reheated travels

by the sight of the hosting answered about
by the side of the hosting service

I answered about
washed

washed I answered about
washed by my memory

formerly along time they were on
I speak them of my possessions

I answered what I thought
formerly my way to the elections

time they were on
on a way to the elections

I answered while interfaced
battery dawn nights ending themselves

They were filters
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

formerly along the time they were on
My say to the elections

that they were visible
stopping in the middle

that they were divisible
before I act on them

I assumed that they were divisible
stepping off into the middle
