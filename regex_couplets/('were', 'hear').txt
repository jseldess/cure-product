('were', 'hear')

When we had jobs that were to earn
and my heart rate

my desires were open
Spinning around the heart

I wish my desires were open
I hear it between bills and stuff

I argued the days were longer
I can hear it between bills and stuff

they were on
You can hear it also through your leisure

answered about 
In my heart did I lose trust

formerly along time they were on
