('were', 'her')

When we had jobs that were to earn
To neither study

my desires were open
Where I put it beating

I wish my desires were open
I’ll get there eventually

I argued the days were longer
there was no promotion

I agrued the days were longer
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
that potential is there for you

The days were long
but would I love her the same

they were on
I get through there

in the long time they were on
I get from here through there

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

formerly a long time they were on
if there is anything 

answered about 
where I send and relive

by the sight of the hosting answered about
Where in me did I loose

I answered about
By my memory elsewhere

washed I answered about
after though there’s no memory

formerly along time they were on
I presume to others

I answered what I thought
where rights ended themselves

time they were on
where I send and relive aside

I answered while interfaced
but for memory elsewhere

They were filters
where lights blended themselves

formerly along the time they were on
Cereal and others’ health

that they were visible
The prospects there already

that they were divisible
I assume possession to others
