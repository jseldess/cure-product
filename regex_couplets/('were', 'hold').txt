('were', 'hold')

When we had jobs that were to earn
I take hold of my finger

my desires were open
When they really take hold of my finger

I wish my desires were open
hold at intervals riding forward

I argued the days were longer
Since I had to hold the entire company

The days were long
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

I argued that the days were longer
and hold and wish to hold

in the long time they were on
designed to hold up my underwear

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
