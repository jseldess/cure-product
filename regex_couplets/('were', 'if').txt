('were', 'if')

When we had jobs that were to earn
if you have providence to excess

my desires were open
out of the fifth page ruins

I argued the days were longer
That company creates a life

The days were long
Life is with people

they were on
If I take a different measure

in the long time they were on
If I take some different measure

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
if there is anything 

answered about 
if that has anything

formerly a long time they were on
if only on the way to the trash

that they were divisible
