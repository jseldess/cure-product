('were', 'know.')

When we had jobs that were to earn
I even know what I would find

they were on
even when close to my knowing

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
knowing the constituents

formerly a long time they were on
who knows the way

I answered about
who knows how to turn it off

I answered what I thought
that their knowing

that they were visible
