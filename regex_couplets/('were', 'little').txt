('were', 'little')

When we had jobs that were to earn
with little reason to move

The days were long
There was very little physical activity

I argued that the days were longer
with little reasons to aspiration

The days were long aligned
aspirating with little visions

they were on
I swayed a little in my state

in the long time they were on
