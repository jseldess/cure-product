('were', 'longer')

When we had jobs that were to earn
I argued the days felt longer

I argued the days were longer
I agrued the days were longer

The days were long
I argued that the days were longer

The days were long aligned
without longer damage

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
