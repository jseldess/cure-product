('were', 'man')

When we had jobs that were to earn
not many face up

they were on
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
They have very many choices

answered about 
and that man comes on to tell me 

by the sight of the hosting answered about
The many transparent pixel calls

I answered what I thought
