('were', 'move')

When we had jobs that were to earn
since I can imagine movement

The days were long
with little reasons to move

I argued that the days were longer
with little reason to move

The days were long aligned
with full potential to movement

they were on
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
and literally moved

answered about 
myself moved literally as it is

formerly a long time they were on
and literally moved about

by the sight of the hosting answered about
not literally moved about

washed I answered about
also didnâ€™t really move

I answered about
not literally moved

in the long time they were on
