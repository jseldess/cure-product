('were', 'movement')

When we had jobs that were to earn
since I can imagine movement

The days were long
with full potential to movement

I argued that the days were longer
since you can imagine movement

The days were long aligned
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
