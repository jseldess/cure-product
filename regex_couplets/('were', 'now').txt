('were', 'now')

When we had jobs that were to earn
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

I argued the days were longer
I take it out in the snow fall

they were on
even when close to my knowing

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
knowing the constituents

formerly a long time they were on
who knows the way

I answered about
who knows how to turn it off

I answered what I thought
that their knowing

that they were visible
