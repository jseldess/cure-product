('were', 'offer')

When we had jobs that were to earn
in the form filled offered in trust

formerly a long time they were on
in the form filled offered trust

answered about 
in the form filled offered must

formerly along time they were on
in track as offer asked 

I answered what I thought
I assume the offers reliable

that they were visible
So I presume the offers already

that they were divisible
I presume the offers

I assumed that they were divisible
Or can have seen offering possession
