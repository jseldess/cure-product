('were', 'purchases')

When we had jobs that were to earn
I tell you the weight of my purchases

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
I have entered my purchases

answered about 
for my own purchases

I answered about
impulse for my own purchases

in the long time they were on
