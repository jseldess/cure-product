('were', 'resume')

When we had jobs that were to earn
I resume unassimilable visions

they were on
I resume attributable visions

in the long time they were on
I continue to presume

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
I presume to others

formerly a long time they were on
So I presume the offers already

that they were divisible
I presume the offers

I assumed that they were divisible
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
