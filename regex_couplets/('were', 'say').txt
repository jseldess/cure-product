('were', 'say')

When we had jobs that were to earn
we had to say goodbye

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
I ask say in that case

formerly a long time they were on
we ask say in that case

I answered what I thought
formerly along my say to the elections

time they were on
I ask say in that phase decisioned

I answered about
My say to the elections

in the long time they were on
