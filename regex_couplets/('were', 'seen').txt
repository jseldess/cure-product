('were', 'seen')

When we had jobs that were to earn
under the last seen principle

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
Having seen more than 

formerly a long time they were on
being seen by me

that they were divisible
Having seen more than I can remember 

I assumed that they were divisible
Or can have seen offering possession
