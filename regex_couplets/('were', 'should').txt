('were', 'should')

When we had jobs that were to earn
While I should be sleeping

my desires were open
Looking back while I should be sleeping

I wish my desires were open
While I should sleep not back in the results

I argued the days were longer
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
they should rise up
