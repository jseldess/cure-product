('were', 'side')

When we had jobs that were to earn
aside from the retinas

I argued that the days were longer
actually considering the end

they were on
But my not feeling the memory aside

answered about 
where I am aside

formerly a long time they were on
by the side of the hosting service

I answered about
But my not feeling the memory inside

I answered what I thought
where I send and relive aside

in the long time they were on
