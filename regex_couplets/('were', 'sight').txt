('were', 'sight')

When we had jobs that were to earn
In my sight 

The days were long aligned
in pursuit of the sight

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
converting sight

formerly a long time they were on
my sight hosting

answered about 
about the sight hosting trusting

by the sight of the hosting answered about
converting sight into a purchase

I answered what I thought
