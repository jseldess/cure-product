('were', 'stay')

When we had jobs that were to earn
So stay with us

The days were long
own stays brought loyal

formerly a long time they were on
own that stays brought loyal

I answered what I thought
that stays brought loyal

I answered about
I stay the right of my elections

in the long time they were on
home stays brought loyal

that they were divisible
