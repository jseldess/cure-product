('were', 'step')

When we had jobs that were to earn
What the next step

I argued the days were longer
from which to step off

The days were long aligned
step in by the prospect

I answered what I thought
phase decision step in

I answered about
step by into the prospect

that they were divisible
stepping in the middle

I assumed that they were divisible
stepping off into the middle
