('were', 'tell')

When we had jobs that were to earn
The CEO tells me to embody values

I wish my desires were open
I had to tell them the news

The days were long aligned
So I constellate the time family country

they were on
I tell you my purposes

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
and that man comes on to tell me
