('were', 'through')

When we had jobs that were to earn
Back up through the results

I argued the days were longer
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

they were on
I get through there

in the long time they were on
I get from here through there

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
You can hear it also through your leisure
