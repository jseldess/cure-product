('were', 'time.')

When we had jobs that were to earn
 and time in the train

my desires were open
I spend time online learning to code

I wish my desires were open
On the timeline I was on

I argued the days were longer
The long time I had a vision

they were on
in the long time they were on

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
or alter of course the time anyway

formerly a long time they were on
So I constellate the time family country

answered about 
until a happier time found

by the sight of the hosting answered about
formerly along time they were on

I answered what I thought
time they were on

I answered about
formerly along the time they were on

that they were visible
