('were', 'tire')

When we had jobs that were to earn
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I agrued the days were longer
The entire company

I argued the days were longer
Since I had to hold the entire company

The days were long
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

I argued that the days were longer
until I could not tire 

they were on
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

formerly a long time they were on
