('were', 'turn')

When we had jobs that were to earn
I keep turning back again myself

my desires were open
I keep turning back

I wish my desires were open
who knows how to turn it off

I answered what I thought
I turn not sad exactly

I answered about
I return not sad exactly

in the long time they were on
I returned

that they were visible
