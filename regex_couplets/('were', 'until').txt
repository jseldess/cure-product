('were', 'until')

When we had jobs that were to earn
until my purpose up in the sky

I argued the days were longer
until I could not tire 

they were on
until I purpose up in the sky

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
until a happier time found

formerly a long time they were on
