('were', 'up?')

When we had jobs that were to earn
not one virtue to excess

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
when we had jobs that was to churn some bread

my desires were open
Out of the remnants 

I wish my desires were open
and could be mapped and weighed

I argued the days were longer
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

I agrued the days were longer
And as an extension of the values

The days were long
I argued that the days were longer

The days were long aligned
The days of public quantity

they were on
I could in effect credit

in the long time they were on
I have them trust in me

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

formerly a long time they were on
without really agreeing

answered about 
the duration of answers

by the sight of the hosting answered about
in the form filled offered trust

I answered about
which I feel formerly about for

washed I answered about
after though thereâ€™s no memory

formerly along time they were on
I presume to others

I answered what I thought
I thought

time they were on
I assumed what I draw

I answered while interfaced
but for memory elsewhere

They were filters
I answered what I thought about

formerly along the time they were on
about 

that they were visible
and could be inflected with reasons

that they were divisible
decisions that can be attributable

I assumed that they were divisible
You can have seen offering
