('were', 'us')

When we had jobs that were to earn
was not just a defeat

my desires were open
You use the most essential parts

I wish my desires were open
in a continuous vertiginous dream

I argued the days were longer
So stay with us

The days were long
but it continued rippling muscle

The days were long aligned
I reuse unassimilable visions

they were on
I have them trust in me

in the long time they were on
a futile joyous white sun

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

formerly a long time they were on
I want to cite a poem so usual

answered about 
useless for not having paid

by the sight of the hosting answered about
in the form filled offered trust

I answered about
in the form filled offered must

formerly along time they were on
radiating from housing

I answered while interfaced
