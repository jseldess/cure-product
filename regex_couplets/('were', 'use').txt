('were', 'use')

When we had jobs that were to earn
You use the most essential parts

I wish my desires were open
I reuse unassimilable visions

they were on
I used my technology

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
trackers collecting data on users

answered about 
useless for not having paid

formerly a long time they were on
