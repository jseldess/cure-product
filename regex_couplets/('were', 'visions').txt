('were', 'visions')

When we had jobs that were to earn
The planning process for visions

I argued the days were longer
aspirating visions

I agrued the days were longer
aspirating with visions

The days were long
embodied with little visions

I argued that the days were longer
little visions

The days were long aligned
aspirating with little visions

they were on
I resume attributable visions

in the long time they were on
attributable visions

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
visions that can be attainable

that they were divisible
revisions that can be attributable

I assumed that they were divisible
