('were', 'wait')

When we had jobs that were to earn
There are spots waiting

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
Though we are waiting for her

formerly a long time they were on
not needing to wait

answered about 
Though we are waiting 

by the sight of the hosting answered about
Though we canâ€™t help waiting

I answered what I thought
waiting out front or up above 

in the long time they were on
