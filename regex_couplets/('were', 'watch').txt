('were', 'watch')

When we had jobs that were to earn
when watching tv

I argued the days were longer
in the sense of watching

they were on
I watch a movie

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
When I'm watching my tv 

answered about 
so still watch them

I answered about
where Iâ€™m watching my tv

in the long time they were on
