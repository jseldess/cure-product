('were', 'When')

When we had jobs that were to earn
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

my desires were open
When they really take hold of my finger

I wish my desires were open
When closed to my knowing

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
When I'm watching my tv
