('were', 'will')

When we had jobs that were to earn
will not be the same

they were on
that will spur me on

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
would only willingly break

formerly a long time they were on
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

answered about 
my daughter will learn 

I answered what I thought
