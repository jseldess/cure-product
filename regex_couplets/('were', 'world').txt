('were', 'world')

When we had jobs that were to earn
Which can be pronounced to the world

my desires were open
off the edge of the world

I wish my desires were open
off the end of the world

I argued the days were longer
hauling off the end of the world

they were on
the opinions in my world

formerly a long time they were on
