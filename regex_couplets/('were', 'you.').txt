('were', 'you.')

When we had jobs that were to earn
if you have providence to excess

my desires were open
That you can see only the back of

I argued the days were longer
since you can imagine movement

The days were long
where you can earn more 

they were on
a futile joyous white sun

These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

formerly a long time they were on
You can hear it also through your leisure

answered about 
the young ripples inaudibly

that they were visible
