('When', 'call')

When I woke up in the morning
not calling or echoing for once

When I want something
though it was most emphatically that

When we had jobs that were to earn
Which can be called confidence

When they really take hold of my finger
They are called aspirational

When closed to my knowing
to take the call

When I'm watching my tv 
The many transparent pixel calls
