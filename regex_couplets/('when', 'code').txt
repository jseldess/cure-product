('When', 'code')

When I woke up in the morning
as long as I have access to the code

When we had jobs that were to earn
May I have your zip code

When they really take hold of my finger
learned without too much difficulty to code

When closed to my knowing
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

When I'm watching my tv 
zipcode
