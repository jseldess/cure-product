('When', 'earn')

When I woke up in the morning
in light of learning what we see

When I want something
When we had jobs that were to earn

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
I spend time online learning to code

When they really take hold of my finger
learned without too much difficulty to code

When closed to my knowing
decisioned to learn 

When I'm watching my tv 
decisioned to learn back
