('When', 'eat')

When I woke up in the morning
too sunny to eat ice cream

When I want something
I reach repeated expressions first

When we had jobs that were to earn
was not just a defeat

When they really take hold of my finger
executive breath

When closed to my knowing
And from that great distance

When I'm watching my tv 
for the creation of the universe
