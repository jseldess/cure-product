('When', 'excess')

When I woke up in the morning
Did he carry one virtue to excess

When we had jobs that were to earn
not one virtue to excess

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
if you have providence to excess

When they really take hold of my finger
If articles can storm in excess

When I'm watching my tv
