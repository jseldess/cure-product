('When', 'he')

When I woke up in the morning
Then fall then summer from my face

When I want something
The sun isn’t up 

When we had jobs that were to earn
When we had jobs that were to burn some bread

When they really take hold of my finger
I search with my head

When closed to my knowing
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

When I'm watching my tv 
– The Rolling Stones
