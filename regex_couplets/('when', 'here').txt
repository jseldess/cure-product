('when', 'here')

when we had jobs that was to churn some bread
I’ll get there eventually

That’s when they really take
I’ll get there ruins

when trying to feel the extension of key values
there was no promotion

when watching tv
There was very little physical activity

even when close to my owning
I get from here through there

even when close to my knowing
in traversing get through there

even when closed
here is the site of the battle of maldon

when it is not literal
Where in me did I host

when I move
if there is anything
