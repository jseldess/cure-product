('When', 'time.')

When I woke up in the morning
only fragments of time with my children

When we had jobs that were to earn
 and time in the train

When they really take hold of my finger
On the timeline I was on

When closed to my knowing
or alter of course the time anyway

When I'm watching my tv 
formerly along time they were on
