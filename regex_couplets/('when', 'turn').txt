('When', 'turn')

When I woke up in the morning
In a sharp downard turn

When I want something
in a sharp downward turn 

When we had jobs that were to earn
I keep turning back again myself

When they really take hold of my finger
I keep turning back

When closed to my knowing
who knows how to turn it off
