('When', 'up?')

When I woke up in the morning
it was really sunny

When I want something
The sun isn’t up 

When we had jobs that were to earn
not one virtue to excess

When we had jobs that were to burn some bread
when we had jobs that was to churn some bread

When they really take hold of my finger
While I should be sleeping 

When closed to my knowing
If I take some different measure

When I'm watching my tv 
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going
