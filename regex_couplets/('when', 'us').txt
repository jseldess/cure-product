('When', 'us')

When I woke up in the morning
Because it was really dark

When I want something
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

When we had jobs that were to earn
was not just a defeat

When they really take hold of my finger
in a continuous vertiginous dream

When closed to my knowing
a futile joyous white sun

When I'm watching my tv 
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
