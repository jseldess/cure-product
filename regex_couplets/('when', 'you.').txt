('When', 'you.')

When I woke up in the morning
Though how can you know without direction

When we had jobs that were to earn
if you have providence to excess

When they really take hold of my finger
That you can see only the back of

When closed to my knowing
a futile joyous white sun

When I'm watching my tv 
the young ripples inaudibly
