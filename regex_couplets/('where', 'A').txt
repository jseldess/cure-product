('Where', 'A')

Where I sleep at times
Ask who I am to suspend

Whereas direction is beside the point
Arrayed out in such a nested way

Where official policy is to catch and release
A turtle fished out of the lake

Where I put it beating
A person from a distance

Where I take my liesure
All that I can think I want

Where I lead gravity
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Where I need gravity
And for an ungraspable time

Where in me did I host
And we could inhabit the room easy

Where I host my purposes
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

Where in me did I last
All parties would be held

Where in me did I lose
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
