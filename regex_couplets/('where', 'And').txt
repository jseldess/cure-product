('where', 'And')

where I sleep at times
And put in place as though stationary

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
And make myself a visible

where I can lay claim to ruins
And as an extension of the values

where you can earn more 
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

where I need gravity
And for an ungraspable time

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
And reached up the screen

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
And we could inhabit the room easy

Elsewhere by my memory
