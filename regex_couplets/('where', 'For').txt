('Where', 'For')

Where I sleep at times
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Where official policy is to catch and release
Forecasting the story before dawn

Where I take my liesure
For an ungraspable time

Where I lead gravity
For Mitt Romney

Where I host my purposes
For my own purchases

Where in me did I host
Formerly a way like this one
