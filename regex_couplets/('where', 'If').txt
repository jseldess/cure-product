('Where', 'if')

Where I sleep at times
drifting away

Where official policy is to catch and release
out of the fifth page ruins

Where I take my liesure
If I take a different measure

Where I lead gravity
if there is anything 

Where I host my purposes
if you have providence

Where in me did I last
if that has anything

Where in me did I host
if only on the way to the trash
