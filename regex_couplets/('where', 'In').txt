('Where', 'IN')

Where I sleep at times
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

Where official policy is to catch and release
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

Where I take my liesure
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

Where I lead gravity
By NATASHA SINGER

Where in me did I last
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
