('Where', 'so')

Where I sleep at times
Iâ€™ll pull myself another personality type

Where official policy is to catch and release
A person from a distance

Where I put it beating
Even before the lesson starts

Where I take my liesure
no solid ground to continue along

Where I lead gravity
or in some imaginary elsewhere

Where I need gravity
so that nothing had gravity

Where in me did I host
I want to cite a poem so usual

Where I host my purposes
More reasons around my country 

Where in me did I last
and sound redundant

Where in me did I lose
so still watch them

Where in me pre-worn
so still them

Where in me did I loose
by in the sound privacy
