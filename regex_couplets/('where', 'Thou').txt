('Where', 'Thou')

Where I sleep at times
Though there are quarters goals

Where official policy is to catch and release
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

Where I take my liesure
Though in not many acts

Where I lead gravity
Though we are waiting for her

Where in me did I host
Though we are breaking 

Where in me did I last
Though we are waiting 

Where in me did I lose
Though we can’t help waiting
