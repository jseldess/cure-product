('Where', 'though')

Where I sleep at times
As though stationary and a destination

Where official policy is to catch and release
I had nightmares though

Where I take my liesure
though not many freeze up

Where I lead gravity
I thought

Where in me did I host
though it was most emphatically that

Where I host my purposes
though we are still breaking in

Where in me did I last
after though thereâ€™s no memory

Where in me did I loose
though we are waiting for her
