('Where', 'To')

Where I sleep at times
To my children Walt Whitman

Where official policy is to catch and release
To that impossible place

Where I take my liesure
Tomorrow

Where I lead gravity
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

Where I host my purposes
To neither study

Where in me did I last
To the ends of transactions
