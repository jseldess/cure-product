('where', 'Where')

where I sleep at times
Where official policy is to catch and release

where I can lay claim to ruins
Where I take my liesure

where you can earn more 
Where I lead gravity

where I need gravity
Where in me did I host

Elsewhere by my memory
Where I host my purposes

and elsewhere my memory
Where in me did I last

where I send and relive aside
Where in me did I lose

where in me pre-worn
Where in me did I loose

By my memory elsewhere
Where in me did I lose trust

where rights ended themselves
