('where', 'about')

where I sleep at times
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
burrowed about from repeated travels

where I send and relive
and literally moved about

Elsewhere my memory
answered about 

Elsewhere by my memory
about the site

where in me pre-worn
I answered about

By my memory elsewhere
which I feel formerly about for

where rights ended themselves
not literally moved about

where I send and relive aside
I answered what I thought about

where lights blended themselves
about 

I learned the point where I am
