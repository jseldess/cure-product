('Where', 'act')

Where I sleep at times
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Where official policy is to catch and release
I was enjoined to act again

Where I take my liesure
actually considering the end

Where I lead gravity
we had inhabited actually

Where in me did I host
to the ends of my transactions

Where I host my purposes
The ends of my transactions

Where in me did I lose
To the ends of transactions
