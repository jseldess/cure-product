('where', 'already')

where I sleep at times
already formerly a long time

Elsewhere by my memory
dawn already formerly nights 

and elsewhere my memory
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

where I send and relive would be held
already formely a long time

where I send and relive aside
with dawn already formerly nights 

where in me pre-worn
So I presume the offers already
