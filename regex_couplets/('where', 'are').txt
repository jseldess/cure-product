('where', 'are')

where I sleep at times
Though there are quarters goals

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
barely outlines

where you can earn more 
but they are black spots

but where is it
There are spots waiting

or in some imaginary elsewhere
Though we are waiting for her

Elsewhere by my memory
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

elsewhere my purposes
though we are still breaking in

where I send and relive would be held
Though we are breaking 

where I send and relive aside
Though we are waiting 

where in me pre-worn
still carefully

By my memory elsewhere
There are constant ways

where rights ended themselves
That are my right to say

I learned the point where I am
careening between the preambles
