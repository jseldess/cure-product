('where', 'around')

where I sleep at times
Spinning around the heart

where I can lay claim to ruins
around my country 

but where is it
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

where I need gravity
around the dogs and lillies

or in some imaginary elsewhere
More reasons around my country 

and elsewhere my memory of you
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

where I send and relive
and around redundant

Elsewhere my memory
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

where rights ended themselves
