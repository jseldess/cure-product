('where', 'at')

where I sleep at times
variegated reflected light

That’s where I sleep at times
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

where I can lay claim to ruins
hovering above standing water

where I can claim to see the ruins
emerging this year from standing water

from where I can claim
emerging this year from too much standing water

where you can earn more 
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

but where is it
attesting this is a chance

where I need gravity
And from that great distance

or in some imaginary elsewhere
I watch a movie

Elsewhere by my memory
I designated 

and elsewhere my memory
was not just a defeat

and elsewhere my memory of you
trackers collecting data on users

elsewhere my purposes
designated 

where I send and relive would be held
found dated for my own purchases

where I stand and relive
sound inundated for my own purchases

where I send and relive aside
and found inundated

Elsewhere my memory
in the space that it had

where I end
and drowned inundated

where I send and relive
where I am aside at least

the point where I am
burrowed about from repeated travels

where I stand and retrieve and relive
the duration of answers

where I end and relive
for the duration of answers

where I blend and relive
and latently from constituents

where in me pre-worn
so still watch them

By my memory elsewhere
In what part did I lose trust

where rights ended themselves
I assumed what I draw

where I send and retrieve aside
for the duration of the answer

where I send and retrieve relive
from cables reheated travels

where I am aside
where I’m watching my tv

firing and connecting somewhere
at least most days

in memory elsewhere
radiating from housing

but for memory elsewhere
I answered what I thought

in memory persisting elsewhere
I answered what I thought about

where lights blended themselves
stopped light with validated fields

I learned the point where I am
rendered approximately

where the tongue rippled
state kept owned impression
