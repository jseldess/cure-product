('Where', 'count')

Where I sleep at times
Then I constellate my time family country

Where official policy is to catch and release
I brought my count down

Where I take my liesure
without the long time I was accounting

Where I lead gravity
So I constellate the time family country

Where I host my purposes
More reasons around my country 

Where in me did I last
