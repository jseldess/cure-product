('Where', 'do')

Where I sleep at times
The dogs and lillies

Whereas direction is beside the point
in a sharp downward turn 

Where official policy is to catch and release
I brought my qualities down

Where I put it beating
which I brought down with qualities

Where I take my liesure
Undoubtedly 

Where I lead gravity
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

Where I need gravity
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

Where in me did I host
and it doesn’t take long

Where in me did I lose
latency which doesn’t mean anything

Where in me did I loose
I only think I don’t listen
