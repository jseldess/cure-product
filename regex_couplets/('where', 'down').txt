('Where', 'down')

Where I sleep at times
in a sharp downward turn 

Where official policy is to catch and release
I brought my qualities down

Where I put it beating
which I brought down with qualities

Where I take my liesure
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

Where I need gravity
One was up where it should be down

Where in me did I host
