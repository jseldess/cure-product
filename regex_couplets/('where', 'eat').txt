('Where', 'eat')

Where I sleep at times
too sunny to eat ice cream

Where official policy is to catch and release
Where I put it beating

Where I take my liesure
it was not just a defeat

Where I lead gravity
And from that great distance

Where I need gravity
was not just a defeat

Where I host my purposes
for the creation of the universe

Where in me did I host
burrowed about from repeated travels
