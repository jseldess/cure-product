('Where', 'else')

Where I sleep at times
If you have confidence regardless all else

Where official policy is to catch and release
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

Where I lead gravity
and elsewhere my memory

Where I host my purposes
elsewhere my purposes

Where in me did I last
elsewhere by my memory

Where in me did I loose
By my memory elsewhere

Where in me pre-worn
in memory elsewhere
