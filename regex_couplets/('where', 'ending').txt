('Where', 'ending')

Where I sleep at times
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Where official policy is to catch and release
I tried to feel the key values extending 

Where I take my liesure
talking into pheasants bending themselves

Where I lead gravity
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

Where in me did I host
battery dawn nights ending themselves
