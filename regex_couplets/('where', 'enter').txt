('Where', 'enter')

Where I sleep at times
I have entered my phone

Where official policy is to catch and release
The sun high enough to enter directly 

Where I lead gravity
I have entered my purposes

Where I host my purposes
I have entered my purchases

Where in me did I last
I had entered my phone
