('Where', 'feel')

Where I sleep at times
conversations with our feelings

Where official policy is to catch and release
I tried to feel the key values extending 

Where I take my liesure
What would I feel without that goal

Where I lead gravity
But my not feeling the memory aside

Where I host my purposes
But my not feeling the memory inside

Where in me did I host
which feels most comfortable

Where in me did I lose
which is what feels most comfortable

Where in me did I loose
which I feel formerly about for

Where in me pre-worn
By my feeling the memory inside
