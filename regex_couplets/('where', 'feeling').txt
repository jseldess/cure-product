('where', 'feeling')

where I sleep at times
conversations with our feelings

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
But my not feeling the memory aside

where I send and relive aside
But my not feeling the memory inside

where I send and relive
By my feeling the memory inside

where rights ended themselves
But my feeling the memory aside

firing and connecting somewhere
