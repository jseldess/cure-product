('Where', 'form')

Where I sleep at times
There are performance reviews

Where official policy is to catch and release
Toward the start informally given my reasons

Where I lead gravity
already formerly a long time

Where in me did I host
in the form filled offered in trust

Where I host my purposes
A way formerly like this one

Where in me did I last
already formely a long time

Where in me did I lose
in the form filled offered trust

Where in me did I loose
which I feel formerly about for

Where in me pre-worn
in the form filled offered

Where did I lose trust in me
dawn already formerly nights
