('where', 'from')

where I sleep at times
Then fall then summer from my face

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
drifting away from the task

where I can lay claim to ruins
emerging this year from standing water

from where I can claim
from where I can claim to see the mosquitos

where you can earn more 
from home

but where is it
I get from here through there

where I need gravity
And from a weak distance

or in some imaginary elsewhere
breaking from my constituents

where I send and relive
from no one point

where I am aside at least
and relive from burrowed travels

where I stand and retrieve and relive
from my constituents

Elsewhere my memory
burrowed about from repeated travels

where I am aside
radiating from housing

but for memory elsewhere
