('Where', 'front')

Where I sleep at times
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Where official policy is to catch and release
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

Where I put it beating
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

Where I take my liesure
And need out in front purchase

Where I lead gravity
behind or out front or up above
