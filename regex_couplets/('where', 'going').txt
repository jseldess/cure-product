('Where', 'going')

Where I sleep at times
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Where official policy is to catch and release
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

Where I take my liesure
The way that she is going

Where in me did I last
The way that I am going
