('where', 'had')

where I sleep at times
If he had not carried one virtue

where I can lay claim to ruins
I had me a vision

where you can earn more 
The long time I had a vision

but where is it
I had a vision

where I need gravity
that nothing had gravity

Elsewhere by my memory
in the space that it had

and elsewhere my memory
in the face that I had

where I send and relive would be held
which had on honor to be told

Elsewhere my memory
in the face that it had

where in me pre-worn
I had entered my phone

By my memory elsewhere
