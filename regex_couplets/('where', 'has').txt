('Where', 'has')

Where I sleep at times
conversations with our purchase

Where official policy is to catch and release
in traversing my purchase

Where I take my liesure
purchased out

Where I lead gravity
until I purchase up the sky

Where I need gravity
I tell you the weight of my purchases

Where in me did I host
if that has anything

Where I host my purposes
I have entered my purchases

Where in me did I last
For my own purchases

Where in me did I lose
phase decisioned by the prospect
