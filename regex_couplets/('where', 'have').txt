('where', 'have')

where I sleep at times
I have entered my phone

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
if you have providence to excess

where I can lay claim to ruins
If you have confidence regardless all else

where I need gravity
I have supporters

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I have a memory between the day

Elsewhere by my memory
I have entered my purposes

and elsewhere my memory of you
I have entered my purchases

where I send and relive aside
They have very many choices

elsewhere my purposes
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

where in me pre-worn
I have turned it off

where rights ended themselves
I have them lost

I learned the point where I am
I have them trust in me

where the tongue rippled
I have seen more than I can remember
