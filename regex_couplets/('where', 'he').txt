('Where', 'he')

Where I sleep at times
But that is beside the point

Whereas direction is beside the point
The dogs and lillies

Where official policy is to catch and release
A turtle fished out of the lake

Where I put it beating
Out of the remnants 

Where I take my liesure
I take it out in the snow fall

Where I lead gravity
I continued to dream then

Where I need gravity
They can be waived

Where in me did I host
in the form filled offered in trust

Where I host my purposes
and elsewhere my memory

Where in me did I last
Elsewhere by my memory

Where I stand and relive
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

Where I send and relive aside
I stand and retrieve the impuse

Where in me did I lose
washed by my memory

Where in me did I loose
in the form filled offered trust

Where in me pre-worn
washed

Where in me did I lose trust
in the form filled offered

Where did I lose trust in me
Where did we lose trust
