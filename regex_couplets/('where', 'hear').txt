('Where', 'hear')

Where I sleep at times
You can hear it also through your leisure

Where official policy is to catch and release
and my heart rate

Where I put it beating
Spinning around the heart

Where I take my liesure
I can hear it between bills and stuff

Where I lead gravity
In my heart did I lose trust

Where did I lose trust in me
