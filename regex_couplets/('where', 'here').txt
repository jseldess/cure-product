('Where', 'here')

Where I sleep at times
Whereas direction is beside the point

Where official policy is to catch and release
I’ll get there eventually

Where I put it beating
I’ll get there ruins

Where I take my liesure
there was no promotion

Where I lead gravity
where I need gravity

Where in me did I host
Elsewhere by my memory

Where I host my purposes
and elsewhere my memory

Where in me did I last
Where I stand and relive

Where I send and relive aside
Elsewhere my memory

Where in me did I lose
Where in me did I loose

Where in me pre-worn
By my memory elsewhere

Where in me did I lose trust
Where did I lose trust in me

Where did we lose trust
Is there a baby and a bear
