('where', 'into')

where I sleep at times
into rotating directionless 

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
into a brigand and a murderer

where I can lay claim to ruins
into the well controlled climate

where you can earn more 
talking into pheasants bending themselves

but where is it
Then I saw into you

where I need gravity
entered into my purposes

elsewhere my purposes
deep into pathways from repeated travels

where I send and relive
stopping into the prospect

Elsewhere by my memory
step by into the prospect

where rights ended themselves
converting sight into a purchase

By my memory elsewhere
into liminal reflexing

where the tongue rippled
into an oral
