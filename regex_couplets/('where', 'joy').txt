('Where', 'joy')

Where I sleep at times
Between the face of pure joy and an interface.

Where official policy is to catch and release
I was enjoying acting against myself

Where I take my liesure
a futile joyous white sun

Where I lead gravity
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

Where in me did I host
