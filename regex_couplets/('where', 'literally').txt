('Where', 'literally')

Where I sleep at times
and literally moved

Where I host my purposes
as it was designed literally

Where in me did I last
and literally unproved

Where in me did I host
I literally moved

Where in me did I lose
what literally moved

Where in me did I loose
not literally moved about

Where in me pre-worn
not literally moved
