('Where', 'live')

Where I sleep at times
I am to end my connections suspended live

Whereas direction is beside the point
I suspend live connections to you

Where official policy is to catch and release
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Where I lead gravity
Which is a pleasure to never live out

Where I host my purposes
where I send and relive aside

Where in me did I last
Where I stand and relive

Where in me did I host
where I send and relive
