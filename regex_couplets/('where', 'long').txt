('where', 'long')

where I sleep at times
as long as I have access to the code

That’s where I sleep at times
over the long time up in the sky

where I can lay claim to ruins
over the long line up in the sky

where you can earn more 
and continue along having 

but where is it
The long time I had a vision

where I need gravity
without longer damage

Elsewhere by my memory
already formerly a long time

and elsewhere my memory
already formely a long time

where I send and relive aside
and it doesn’t take long

where I send and retrieve relive
formerly a long time they were on

where in me pre-worn
formerly along time they were on

where rights ended themselves
drawn formerly a long time

By my memory elsewhere
along cables

where I am aside increased
mostly along cables

where I am aside
in the long time they were on

but for memory elsewhere
shone formerly along time

where lights blended themselves
drawn formerly along 

I learned the point where I am
