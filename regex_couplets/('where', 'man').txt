('Where', 'man')

Where I sleep at times
as a cure my exception Walt Whitman

Where official policy is to catch and release
not many face up

Where I lead gravity
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

Where in me did I host
They have very many choices

Where in me did I last
and that man comes on to tell me 

Where in me did I lose
The many transparent pixel calls
