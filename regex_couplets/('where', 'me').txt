('where', 'me')

where I sleep at times
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

That’s where I sleep at times
in a moment of drifting away from the task

where I can lay claim to ruins
emerging this year from standing water

from where I can claim
emerging this year from too much standing water

where you can earn more 
from home

but where is it
The long time I had a vision

where I need gravity
And for an ungraspable time

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
I had me a vision

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I could consume the dream

Elsewhere by my memory
washed by my memory

and elsewhere my memory
and elsewhere my memory of you

where I send and relive aside
Elsewhere my memory

elsewhere my purposes
A way formerly like this one

where I send and relive would be held
already formely a long time

where I stand and relive
Where in me did I last

where I end
washed my memory

where I send and relive
But my not feeling the memory inside

where I send and retrieve aside
dawn formerly

where I am aside at least
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

where I send and retrieve relive
But my not feeling the memory aside

where I end and relive
firing and connecting somewhere

where I send and receive
for not paying sound overwhelmed

where in me pre-worn
by my memory

By my memory elsewhere
which I feel formerly about for

where rights ended themselves
drawn formerly a long time

where I stand aside
But my feeling the memory aside

where I am aside increased
joined me in wasting my vision

in memory elsewhere
in the long time they were on

but for memory elsewhere
in memory persisting elsewhere

where lights blended themselves
drawn formerly along 

I learned the point where I am
I have them trust in me

where the tongue rippled
I can’t remember them
