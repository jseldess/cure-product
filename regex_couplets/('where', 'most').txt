('Where', 'most')

Where I sleep at times
though it was most emphatically that

Where official policy is to catch and release
You use the most essential parts

Where I take my liesure
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

Where in me did I last
which feels most comfortable

Where in me did I host
most comfortable

Where in me did I lose
mostly along cables
