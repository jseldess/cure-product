('Where', 'move')

Where I sleep at times
since I can imagine movement

Where I take my liesure
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

Where I lead gravity
and literally moved

Where I host my purposes
myself moved literally as it is

Where in me did I host
I move

Where in me did I lose
what literally moved

Where in me did I loose
not literally moved about

Where in me pre-worn
also didnâ€™t really move
