('Where', 'moved')

Where I sleep at times
and literally moved

Where I host my purposes
myself moved literally as it is

Where in me did I host
I literally moved

Where in me did I lose
what literally moved

Where in me did I loose
not literally moved about

Where in me pre-worn
not literally moved
