('where', 'myself')

where I sleep at times
But I can’t let myself treat 

That’s where I sleep at times
I let myself treat

where I can lay claim to ruins
I was enjoined to act again myself

where you can earn more 
myself

Elsewhere my memory
the least productive of myself

where I am aside
the least instructive of myself

where I’m watching my tv
at least instructive of myself

where I am aside at least
So I find myself at home
