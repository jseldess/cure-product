('Where', 'need')

Where I sleep at times
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Where official policy is to catch and release
I need the work

Where I lead gravity
where I need gravity

Where in me did I host
not needing to wait

Where in me did I lose
in need one in that best own
