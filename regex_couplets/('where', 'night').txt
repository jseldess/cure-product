('where', 'night')

where I sleep at times
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

That’s where I sleep at times
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

where I can lay claim to ruins
blue and sun again a second, then night

where you can earn more 
battery dawn nights blending themselves

where I need gravity
dawn already formerly nights 

and elsewhere my memory
last night

Elsewhere my memory
with dawn already formerly nights 

Elsewhere by my memory
battery dawn nights 

where rights ended themselves
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in memory elsewhere
dawn formerly nights lended themselves

where lights blended themselves
