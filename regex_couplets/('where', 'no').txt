('where', 'no')

where I sleep at times
asynchronous 

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

where I can lay claim to ruins
there was no promotion

where you can earn more 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

but where is it
until I could not be tired

where I need gravity
I used my technology

or in some imaginary elsewhere
that nothing had gravity

Elsewhere by my memory
The sun high enough to enter directly

and elsewhere my memory
and other types of tracking technology

and elsewhere my memory of you
which we can pronounce

where I send and relive aside
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

elsewhere my purposes
not speaking

where I send and relive would be held
But my not feeling the memory aside

Elsewhere my memory
But my not feeling the memory inside

where I send and relive
from no one point

where I am aside at least
not needing to wait

where I stand and retrieve and relive
knowing the constituents

where in me pre-worn
who knows the way

By my memory elsewhere
not literally moved about

where rights ended themselves
But my not 

in memory elsewhere
between cereal and economic

I learned the point where I am
that their knowing

where the tongue rippled
in that I cannot remember
