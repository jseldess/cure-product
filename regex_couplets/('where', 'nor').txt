('Where', 'nor')

Where I sleep at times
into the minority proportion of time

Whereas direction is beside the point
over the long line I would honor

Where official policy is to catch and release
the simple act of honoring an accountant

Where I lead gravity
nor work in this way daily

Where I host my purposes
which had on honor to be told

Where in me did I host
