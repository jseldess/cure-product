('Where', 'now')

Where I sleep at times
On a snow day with my children

Where official policy is to catch and release
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

Where I take my liesure
I take it out in the snow fall

Where I lead gravity
knowing the constituents

Where in me did I host
who knows the way

Where in me did I loose
who knows how to turn it off
