('where', 'off')

where I sleep at times
I step off the edge

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
off the edge of the world

where I can lay claim to ruins
I am first in the office

where you can earn more 
off the end of the world

but where is it
Sweets and coffee and juice

where I need gravity
in the form filled offered in trust

Elsewhere by my memory
in the form filled offered trust

where in me pre-worn
in the form filled offered must

where rights ended themselves
in track as offer asked 

By my memory elsewhere
iced coffee and sun position

I learned the point where I am
I assume the offers reliable
