('Where', 'offer')

Where I sleep at times
So I presume the offers already

Where official policy is to catch and release
in the form filled offered in trust

Where I host my purposes
in the form filled offered trust

Where in me did I loose
in the form filled offered must

Where in me pre-worn
in the form filled offered

Where did I lose trust in me
in track as offer asked
