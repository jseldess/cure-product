('Where', 'only')

Where I sleep at times
only fragments of time with my children

Where official policy is to catch and release
So that I notice I am the only one

Where I take my liesure
only in the case

Where I lead gravity
would only willingly break

Where in me did I host
if only on the way to the trash
