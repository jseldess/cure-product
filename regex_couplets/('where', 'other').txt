('where', 'other')

where I sleep at times
others desires

That’s where I sleep at times
I’ll pull myself another personality type

where I can lay claim to ruins
On the other hand

but where is it
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

where I need gravity
and other types of tracking technology

and elsewhere my memory of you
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

elsewhere my purposes
I presume to others

Elsewhere by my memory
to the other end

where rights ended themselves
Cereal and others’ health

I learned the point where I am
I assume possession to others
