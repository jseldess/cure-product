('Where', 'our')

Where I sleep at times
reasons resources

Where official policy is to catch and release
or an available resource

Where I take my liesure
You can hear it also through your leisure

Where I lead gravity
or alter of course the time anyway

Where in me did I host
This is your voice 

Where I host my purposes
Who throws contours away
