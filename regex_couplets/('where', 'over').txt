('Where', 'over')

Where I sleep at times
I step over the edge

Where official policy is to catch and release
hovering above standing water

Where I take my liesure
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

Where I lead gravity
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

Where in me did I host
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

Where in me did I last
for not paying sound overwhelmed

Where in me did I lose
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
