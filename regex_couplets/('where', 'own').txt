('where', 'own')

where I sleep at times
In a sharp downard turn

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
the down arrow

where I can lay claim to ruins
oddly grown over with historic bark

where you can earn more 
even when close to my owning

where I need gravity
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

One was up where it should be down
the impulse for my own prospects

where I end
the impulse for my own purposes

where I stand aside
for my own purchases

where I send and relive would be held
found dated for my own purchases

where I stand and relive
sound inundated for my own purchases

where I send and relive aside
the impulse my own prospects

where I send and retrieve aside
and drowned inundated

where I send and relive
impulse for my own purchases

where I stand and retrieve
own stays brought loyal

Elsewhere by my memory
in need one in that best own

where rights ended themselves
own that stays brought loyal

By my memory elsewhere
the impulse for my own purchases

where I stand aside and retrieve
for my own purposes

I learned the point where I am
state reflexing indented in my own

where the tongue rippled
the void kept owned impression
