('Where', 'pleasure')

Where I sleep at times
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Where official policy is to catch and release
there was no walking along the pleasure

Where I take my liesure
up in the television pleasure

Where I lead gravity
Which is a pleasure to never live out

Where I host my purposes
