('Where', 'prospect')

Where I sleep at times
The prospects there already

Where official policy is to catch and release
the impulse for my own prospects

Where I host my purposes
the impulse my own prospects

Where in me did I host
stopping into the prospect

Where in me did I lose
speech that is of by prospects
