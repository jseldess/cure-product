('Where', 'purchase')

Where I sleep at times
conversations with our purchase

Where official policy is to catch and release
in traversing my purchase

Where I take my liesure
purchased out

Where I lead gravity
until I purchase up the sky

Where I need gravity
I tell you the weight of my purchases

Where in me did I host
I have entered my purchases

Where I host my purposes
washed my purchases

Where in me did I last
For my own purchases

Where in me did I lose
converting sight into a purchase
