('Where', 'purchases')

Where I sleep at times
I tell you the weight of my purchases

Where I lead gravity
Is the weight of my purchases

Where I need gravity
I have entered my purchases

Where I host my purposes
washed my purchases

Where in me did I last
For my own purchases

Where in me did I host
impulse for my own purchases
