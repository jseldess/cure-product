('where', 'purpose')

where I sleep at times
by no ventillation my purpose

where I can lay claim to ruins
until my purpose up in the sky

where you can earn more 
until I purpose the horizon

where I need gravity
I tell you my purposes

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
my purpose up in the sky

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
I tell you the weight of my purposes

I tell you where I need gravity
weight of my purposes

Elsewhere by my memory
Where I host my purposes

and elsewhere my memory
I have entered my purposes

and elsewhere my memory of you
the impulse for my own purposes

where I stand aside
the impulse to my purpose

where I stand and retrieve
aside the impulse to my purpose

where I stand aside and retrieve
entered into my purposes

elsewhere my purposes
to the other end of my purpose

where rights ended themselves
for my own purposes

I learned the point where I am
