('Where', 'purposes')

Where I sleep at times
I tell you my purposes

Where I lead gravity
I tell you the weight of my purposes

Where I need gravity
weight of my purposes

Where in me did I host
Where I host my purposes

Where in me did I last
the impulse for my own purposes

Where in me did I lose
for my own purposes
