('Where', 'really')

Where I sleep at times
because it was really dark

Where official policy is to catch and release
When they really take hold of my finger

Where I take my liesure
without really agreeing

Where I host my purposes
without really speaking

Where in me did I last
without really breaking

Where in me did I host
without really binding

Where in me did I lose
also didnâ€™t really move
