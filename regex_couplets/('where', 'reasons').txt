('Where', 'reasons')

Where I sleep at times
reasons resources

Where official policy is to catch and release
with little reasons to aspiration

Where I take my liesure
Toward the start informally given my reasons

Where I lead gravity
More reasons around my country 

Where I host my purposes
and could be inflected with reasons
