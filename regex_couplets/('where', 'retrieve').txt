('where', 'retrieve')

where I sleep at times
I send and retrieve the impulse

where I send and relive aside
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

where I stand and relive
where I send and retrieve aside

where I stand aside
where I stand and retrieve

where I stand aside and retrieve
where I stand and retrieve relive

and elsewhere my memory 
I stand and retrieve the impulse

Elsewhere by my memory
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

Elsewhere my memory
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

where I send and relive
where I send and retrieve relive

where I stand and retrieve and relive
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

where rights ended themselves
retrieve 

where I am aside
