('Where', 'ring')

Where I sleep at times
interferring 

Where official policy is to catch and release
hovering above standing water

Where I take my liesure
actually considering the end

Where I lead gravity
firing and connecting somewhere

Where in me did I host
The prospect for veering healthily
