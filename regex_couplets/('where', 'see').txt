('where', 'see')

where I sleep at times
Then I cannot see face value

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
where I can claim to see the ruins

from where I can claim
to see the ruins

from where I can claim to see the mosquitos
to see the mosquitos emerging from standing water

where you can earn more 
under the last seen principle

where I need gravity
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

Elsewhere by my memory
Having seen more than 

where in me pre-worn
being seen by me
