('Where', 'set')

Where I sleep at times
upset by Gingrich

Where official policy is to catch and release
in front of the set afternoon

Where I take my liesure
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

Where in me did I host
Um, upset by Gingrich

Where I host my purposes
presets
