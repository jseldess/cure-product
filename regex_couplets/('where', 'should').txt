('Where', 'should')

Where I sleep at times
You should ask who I am

Whereas direction is beside the point
While I should be sleeping

Where official policy is to catch and release
Looking back while I should be sleeping

Where I take my liesure
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

Where I need gravity
One was up where it should be down

Where in me did I host
they should rise up

Where in me did I lose
