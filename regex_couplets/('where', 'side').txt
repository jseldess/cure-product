('Where', 'side')

Where I sleep at times
But that is beside the point

Whereas direction is beside the point
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Where official policy is to catch and release
aside from the retinas

Where I take my liesure
actually considering the end

Where I lead gravity
But my not feeling the memory aside

Where I host my purposes
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

Where in me did I last
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

Where I send and relive aside
where I send and retrieve aside

Where in me did I host
by the side of the hosting service

Where in me did I loose
But my not feeling the memory inside
