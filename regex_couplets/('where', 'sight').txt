('Where', 'sight')

Where I sleep at times
In my sight 

Where I take my liesure
in pursuit of the sight

Where I lead gravity
converting sight

Where in me did I host
my sight hosting

Where in me did I lose
about the sight hosting trusting

Where in me did I loose
converting sight into a purchase
