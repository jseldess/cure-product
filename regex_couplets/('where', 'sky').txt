('where', 'sky')

where I sleep at times
over the long time up in the sky

That’s where I sleep at times
over the long line up in the sky

where I can lay claim to ruins
until my purpose up in the sky

where you can earn more 
though not many facts up in the sky

but where is it
Up in the sky

where I need gravity
While they’re up in the sky

Or in some imaginary elsewhere
While we’re up in the sky 

I click my zipcode up where it should be down
