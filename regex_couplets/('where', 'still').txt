('Where', 'still')

Where I sleep at times
But it’s dark outside. It’s still nightime.

Where official policy is to catch and release
I love my daughter still

Where I take my liesure
though we are still breaking in

Where in me did I last
still wash conserving

Where in me pre-worn
so still them

Where in me did I loose
pre-worn and still wash them

Where in me did I lose trust
