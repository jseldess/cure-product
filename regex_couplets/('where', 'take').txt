('where', 'take')

where I sleep at times
I take hold of my finger

where I can lay claim to ruins
If I take a different measure

where you can earn more 
If I take some different measure

but where is it
to take the call

where I am aside at least
and it doesnâ€™t take long

where I send and retrieve relive
