('Where', 'tell')

Where I sleep at times
Then I constellate my time family country

Where official policy is to catch and release
The CEO tells me to embody values

Where I put it beating
I had to tell them the news

Where I take my liesure
So I constellate the time family country

Where I lead gravity
I tell you my purposes

Where I need gravity
I tell you the weight of my purposes

Where in me did I host
and that man comes on to tell me 

Where in me did I lose
