('where', 'them')

where I sleep at times
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
In a continuous theme

where I can lay claim to ruins
or argued for them at least

where you can earn more 
talking into pheasants bending themselves

but where is it
Then I saw them interview

where I need gravity
I designed them to hold up my underwear

or in some imaginary elsewhere
I speak to them

where I send and relive
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

where I send and retrieve relive
I speak to them my possessions

Elsewhere by my memory
pre-worn and still wash them

By my memory elsewhere
so still them

where rights ended themselves
where lights blended themselves

where I send and relive aside
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in memory elsewhere
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

I learned the point where I am
I have them lost

where the tongue rippled
I have them trust in me
