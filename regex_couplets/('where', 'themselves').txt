('where', 'themselves')

where I sleep at times
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times
talking into pheasants bending themselves

where you can earn more 
talking into percents bending themselves

where I need gravity
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

where I send and retrieve relive
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

where rights ended themselves
where lights blended themselves

By my memory elsewhere
battery dawn nights ending themselves

in memory elsewhere
dawn formerly rights lended themselves

I learned the point where I am
