('where', 'then')

where I sleep at times
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

That’s where I sleep at times
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

where I can lay claim to ruins
Then fall then summer

where you can earn more 
Then I continue to dream then

where I need gravity
I continued to dream then

or in some imaginary elsewhere
