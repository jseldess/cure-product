('Where', 'There')

Where I sleep at times
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Where official policy is to catch and release
There was very little physical activity

Where I take my liesure
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

Where I lead gravity
There are spots waiting

Where I need gravity
There are constant ways
