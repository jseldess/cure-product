('Where', 'They')

Where I sleep at times
Theyâ€™re just not mine

Where official policy is to catch and release
They are called aspirational

Where I take my liesure
They can be waived

Where I need gravity
They can be weighed

Where in me did I host
They have very many choices

Where in me did I last
They were filters
