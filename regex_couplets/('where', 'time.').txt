('Where', 'time.')

Where I sleep at times
Then I constellate my time family country

Where official policy is to catch and release
I spend time online learning to code

Where I put it beating
On the timeline I was on

Where I take my liesure
The long time I had a vision

Where I lead gravity
or alter of course the time anyway

Where in me did I host
formerly a long time they were on

Where I host my purposes
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

Where in me did I last
until a happier time found

Where in me did I lose
formerly along time they were on
