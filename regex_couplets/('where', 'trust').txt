('Where', 'trust')

Where I sleep at times
I have them trust in me

Where I lead gravity
in the form filled offered in trust

Where I host my purposes
about the sight hosting trusting

Where in me did I loose
in the form filled offered trust

Where in me pre-worn
Where in me did I lose trust

Where did I lose trust in me
Where did we lose trust
