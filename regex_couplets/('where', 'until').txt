('Where', 'until')

Where I sleep at times
until my purpose up in the sky

Where official policy is to catch and release
until I could not tire 

Where I lead gravity
until I purchase up the sky

Where I need gravity
until the bill came

Where in me did I host
until a happier time found

Where in me did I lose
