('Where', 'up?')

Where I sleep at times
Ask who I am to suspend

Whereas direction is beside the point
I suspend my connections to you

Where official policy is to catch and release
A turtle fished out of the lake

Where I put it beating
Out of the remnants 

Where I take my liesure
I take it out in the snow fall

Where I lead gravity
while consuming damage

Where I need gravity
I tell you my purposes

Where in me did I host
in the form filled offered in trust

Where I host my purposes
The South Carolina primary 

Where in me did I last
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

Where I send and relive aside
I stand and retrieve the impuse

Where in me did I lose
redundant

Where in me did I loose
in the form filled offered trust

Where in me pre-worn
answered about

Where in me did I lose trust
In my heart did I lose trust

Where did I lose trust in me
Where did we lose trust
