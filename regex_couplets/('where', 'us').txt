('Where', 'us')

Where I sleep at times
Ask who I am to suspend

Whereas direction is beside the point
I suspend my connections to you

Where official policy is to catch and release
in a continuous vertiginous dream

Where I put it beating
You use the most essential parts

Where I take my liesure
because there was no solid ground to continue along

Where I lead gravity
I used my technology

Where I need gravity
a futile joyous white sun

Where in me did I host
in the form filled offered in trust

Where I host my purposes
was not just a defeat

Where in me did I last
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

Where I send and relive aside
I stand and retrieve the impuse

Where in me did I lose
about the sight hosting trusting

Where in me did I loose
in the form filled offered trust

Where in me pre-worn
in the form filled offered must

Where in me did I lose trust
In my heart did I lose trust

Where did I lose trust in me
Where did we lose trust
