('Where', 'We')

Where I sleep at times
We’ll have coffee this morning

Whereas direction is beside the point
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Where official policy is to catch and release
We had to say goodbye there

Where I lead gravity
We had inhabited actually

Where in me did I host
We got paid one way by a voice

Where I host my purposes
We ask say in that case
