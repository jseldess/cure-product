('where', 'were')

where I sleep at times
When we had jobs that were to earn

where I can lay claim to ruins
I argued the days were longer

where you can earn more 
they were on

where I need gravity
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

Elsewhere by my memory
formerly a long time they were on

and elsewhere my memory
answered about 

where I send and relive
by the sight of the hosting answered about

where in me pre-worn
I answered about

By my memory elsewhere
washed I answered about

where rights ended themselves
time they were on

where I send and relive aside
in the long time they were on

but for memory elsewhere
I answered what I thought

in memory persisting elsewhere
They were filters

where lights blended themselves
formerly along time they were on

I learned the point where I am
that they were visible
