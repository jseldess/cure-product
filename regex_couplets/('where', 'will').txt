('Where', 'will')

Where I sleep at times
interjecting on a day there will be ambition

Where official policy is to catch and release
will not be the same

Where I lead gravity
would only willingly break

Where in me did I host
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

Where in me did I lose
my daughter will learn
