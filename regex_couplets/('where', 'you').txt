('Where', 'You')

Where I sleep at times
You should ask who I am

Whereas direction is beside the point
You can hear it also through your leisure

Where official policy is to catch and release
You use the most essential parts

Where I take my liesure
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Where I lead gravity
You can have seen offering
