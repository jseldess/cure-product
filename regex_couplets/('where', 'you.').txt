('Where', 'you.')

Where I sleep at times
Though how can you know without direction

Where official policy is to catch and release
That you can see only the back of

Where I take my liesure
where you can earn more 

Where I lead gravity
I tell you my purposes

Where I need gravity
I tell you the weight of my purposes

Where in me did I host
You can hear it also through your leisure

Where I host my purposes
This is your voice 

Where in me did I last
the young ripples inaudibly
