('which', 'but')

which can be pronounced 
Attributable or

which I brought down with qualities
but the sun isn’t up

from which to step off
but it continued

which I needed for an explicit state
but where is it

which is the long time I was on
I resume attributable visions

which is like sleep
attributable visions

and to which I’ve agreed
that decisions can be attributable

which as tracked befitted 
but for memory elsewhere

 as points which are my interest 
decisions that can be attributable

which is not necessarily possible
revisions that can be attributable
