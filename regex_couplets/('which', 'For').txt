('which', 'For')

which can be pronounced 
Forecasting the story before dawn

from which to step off
For an ungraspable time

and to which I’ve agreed
For Mitt Romney

which we can pronounce
For my own purchases

which ran to be told
Formerly a way like this one

which as tracked befitted 
For a while I think I don’t listen

which is not necessarily possible
