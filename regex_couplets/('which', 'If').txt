('which', 'if')

which can be pronounced 
if you have providence to excess

which I brought down with qualities
out of the fifth page ruins

from which to step off
That company creates a life

which I needed for an explicit state
If I take a different measure

which is the long time I was on
If I take some different measure

which is like sleep
if there is anything 

which we can pronounce
if that has anything

which feels more comfortable
if only on the way to the trash

which is not necessarily possible
