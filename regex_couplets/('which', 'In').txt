('Which', 'IN')

Which is a measure to never live out
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

Which can be pronounced to the world
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

Which is a pleasure to never live out
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

Which can be called confidence
By NATASHA SINGER

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
