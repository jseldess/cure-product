('Which', 'so')

Which is a measure to never live out
reasons resources

Which can be pronounced to the world
You can hear it also through your leisure

Which is a pleasure to never live out
soft paper

Which can be called confidence
A person from a distance

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
so still watch them
