('Which', 'Thou')

Which is a measure to never live out
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Though we are waiting for her

Which can be called confidence
Though we are breaking 

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
Though we can’t help waiting
