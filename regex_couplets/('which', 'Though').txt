('which', 'though')

which can be pronounced 
though it was most emphatically that

which I brought down with qualities
I had nightmares though

from which to step off
though not many freeze up

which I needed for an explicit state
I thought

and to which I’ve agreed
though we are still breaking in

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
after though there’s no memory

which as tracked befitted 
though we are waiting for her

which as tracked befitted phased
I answered what I thought

 as points which are my interest
