('which', 'To')

which can be pronounced 
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

which I brought down with qualities
To that impossible place

from which to step off
Tomorrow

which I needed for an explicit state
Toward the start informally given my reasons

which is the long time I was on
To neither study

which we can pronounce
To the ends of transactions

which as tracked befitted 
To the ends of my transactions

which as tracked befitted phased
To the right of determined elections

which I feel formerly about for
