('which', 'what')

which can be pronounced 
I invited most of what came next

from which to step off
I even know what I would find

which I needed for an explicit state
what literally moved

which is what feels most comfortable
In what part did I lose trust

which as tracked befitted 
I answered what I thought

which as tracked befitted phased
I answered what I thought about

 as points which are my interest 
to return what I bought

which is not necessarily possible
