('which', 'act')

which can be pronounced 
I was enjoined to act again

from which to step off
There was very little physical activity

which I needed for an explicit state
we had inhabited actually

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed
to the ends of my transactions

which we can pronounce
The ends of my transactions

which ran to be told
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

which feels more comfortable
To the ends of transactions

which as tracked befitted 
to the ends of actions

which as tracked befitted phased
I turn not sad exactly

 as points which are my interest 
I return not sad exactly

which I feel formerly about for
I returned not sad exactly

which is not necessarily possible
before I act on them
