('which', 'agreed')

which can be pronounced 
and to which I’ve agreed

which we can pronounce
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

which ran to be told
and for which the plan agreed

which feels most comfortable
that agreed one of rest

which as tracked befitted 
and to which the plan agreed

which feels more comfortable
that agreed home

which is not necessarily possible
that agreed to one the people

which as tracked befitted phased
