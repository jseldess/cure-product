('which', 'along')

which can be pronounced 
The days lined along company

from which to step off
there was no walking along the pleasure

which I needed for an explicit state
formerly along time they were on

which as tracked befitted 
formerly along my say to the elections

which as tracked befitted phased
along cables

which I feel formerly about for
shone formerly along time

 as points which are my interest
