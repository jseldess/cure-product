('which', 'already')

which can be pronounced 
already formerly a long time

and to which I’ve agreed
dawn already formerly nights 

which we can pronounce
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

which ran to be told
with dawn already formerly nights 

which as tracked befitted 
So I presume the offers already

which as tracked befitted phased
The prospects there already

which is not necessarily possible
