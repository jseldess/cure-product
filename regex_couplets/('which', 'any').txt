('which', 'any')

which can be pronounced 
Or the company

which I brought down with qualities
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

from which to step off
That company creates a life

which I needed for an explicit state
I walk up and don’t work anymore

which is the long time I was on
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

and to which I’ve agreed
if there is anything 

which we can pronounce
They have very many choices

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
latency which doesn’t mean anything

and for which the plan agreed
if that has anything

which feels more comfortable
there wasn’t any television 

which is what feels most comfortable
The many transparent pixel calls

which as tracked befitted 
or imagined anyway

which is not necessarily possible
