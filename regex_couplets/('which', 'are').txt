('which', 'are')

which can be pronounced 
barely outlines

from which to step off
The days are long

which I needed for an explicit state
There are spots waiting

and to which I’ve agreed
Though we are waiting for her

which we can pronounce
"More popular sites are using more cookies," the report said.

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
Though we are breaking 

which ran to be told
Though we are waiting 

which feels most comfortable
still carefully

which I feel formerly about for
There are constant ways

which as tracked befitted 
That are my right to say

 as points which are my interest 
in welfare and hope

which is not necessarily possible
careening between the preambles
