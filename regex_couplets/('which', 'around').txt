('which', 'around')

which can be pronounced 
Spinning around the heart

which I brought down with qualities
around my country 

which is the long time I was on
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed
More reasons around my country 

which we can pronounce
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

which ran to be told
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

which as tracked befitted
