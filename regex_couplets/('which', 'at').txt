('which', 'at')

which can be pronounced 
the latter

which I brought down with qualities
That’s when they really take

from which to step off
That company creates a life

which I needed for an explicit state
So I constellate the time family country

which is the long time I was on
like flattening sleep 

which is like sleep
battery dawn nights blending themselves

which is all the time
I resume attributable visions

and to which I’ve agreed
if that has anything

which we can pronounce
trackers collecting data on users

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
found dated for my own purchases

which ran to be told
latency which doesn’t mean anything

and for which the plan agreed
I designated 

which feels most comfortable
in the space that it had

which feels more comfortable
that is by possessed

which as tracked befitted 
When I'm watching my tv 

which is what feels most comfortable
so still watch them

which I feel formerly about for
In what part did I lose trust

which as tracked befitted phased
I ask say in that phase decisioned

which as 
stopped light with validated faces

 as points which are my interest 
to return what I bought

which is not necessarily possible
at home brought into privacy
