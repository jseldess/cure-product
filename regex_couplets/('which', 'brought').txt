('which', 'brought')

which can be pronounced 
I brought my head down

which I brought down with qualities
I brought my qualities down

from which to step off
own stays brought loyal

which as tracked befitted 
own that stays brought loyal

which as tracked befitted phased
that stays brought loyal

which I feel formerly about for
at home brought into privacy

which is not necessarily possible
