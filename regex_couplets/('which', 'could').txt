('which', 'could')

which can be pronounced 
and could be mapped and weighed

which I brought down with qualities
could map to the dimnsions of a graph

from which to step off
until I could not tire 

which I needed for an explicit state
until I could not be tired

which is the long time I was on
I could in effect credit

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed
And we could inhabit the room easy

which we can pronounce
and could be inflected with reasons

which is not necessarily possible
