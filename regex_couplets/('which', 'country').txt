('Which', 'country')

Which is a measure to never live out
Then I constellate my time family country

Which can be pronounced to the world
So I constellate the time family country

Which is a pleasure to never live out
around my country 

Which can be called confidence
More reasons around my country 

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
