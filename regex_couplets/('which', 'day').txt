('which', 'day')

which can be pronounced 
I argued the days felt longer

from which to step off
The days were long aligned

which I needed for an explicit state
The day

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed
I have a memory between the day

which we can pronounce
at least most days

which I feel formerly about for
