('Which', 'do')

Which is a measure to never live out
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

Which can be pronounced to the world
The dogs and lillies

Which is a pleasure to never live out
I brought my head down

Which can be called confidence
What I do in my liesure

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything
