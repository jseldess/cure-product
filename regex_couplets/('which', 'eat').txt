('Which', 'eat')

Which is a measure to never live out
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

Which can be pronounced to the world
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Which is a pleasure to never live out
was not just a defeat

Which can be called confidence
And from that great distance

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
for the creation of the universe
