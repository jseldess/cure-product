('Which', 'excess')

Which is a measure to never live out
Did he carry one virtue to excess

Which can be pronounced to the world
if you have providence to excess

Which is a pleasure to never live out
not one virtue to excess

Which can be called confidence
to excess

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
