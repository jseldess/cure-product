('which', 'feel')

which can be pronounced 
I tried to feel the key values extending 

from which to step off
What would I feel without that goal

which I needed for an explicit state
But my not feeling the memory aside

and to which I’ve agreed
But my not feeling the memory inside

which ran to be told
which feels most comfortable

which feels more comfortable
which is what feels most comfortable

latency which doesn’t mean anything
which I feel formerly about for

which as tracked befitted 
By my feeling the memory inside

which as tracked befitted phased
But my feeling the memory aside

 as points which are my interest
