Toward the start informally given my reasons

which is the long time I was on

and to which I’ve agreed

which feels most comfortable
with dawn already formerly nights 

which as tracked befitted

and to which the plan agreed
in the form filled offered trust

which I feel formerly about for

which as tracked befitted phased

which is not necessarily possible
