('which', 'from')

which can be pronounced 
A person from a distance

which I brought down with qualities
out from below the fold

from which to step off
aside from the retinas

which I needed for an explicit state
I get from here through there

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed
breaking from my constituents

which ran to be told
from no one point

which I feel formerly about for
radiating from housing

 as points which are my interest
