('which', 'get')

which can be pronounced 
I’ll get there eventually

which I brought down with qualities
I’ll get there ruins

from which to step off
I get through there

which is all the time
I get from here through there

and to which I’ve agreed
forgetting decisions 

which as tracked befitted 
forgettable

which is not necessarily possible
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
