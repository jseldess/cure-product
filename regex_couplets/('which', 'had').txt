('which', 'had')

which can be pronounced 
When we had jobs that were to earn

which I brought down with qualities
I had me a vision

from which to step off
I had to tell them the news

which I needed for an explicit state
The long time I had a vision

which is the long time I was on
we had to say goodbye

and to which I’ve agreed
We had inhabited actually

which we can pronounce
in the face that I had

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
in the space that it had

which ran to be told
which had on honor to be told

latency which doesn’t mean anything
in the face that it had

which is what feels most comfortable
I had entered my phone

 as points which are my interest
