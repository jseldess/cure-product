('Which', 'has')

Which is a measure to never live out
It has been since

Which can be pronounced to the world
in traversing my purchase

Which is a pleasure to never live out
purchased out

Which can be called confidence
I have entered my purchases

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
phase decisioned by the prospect
