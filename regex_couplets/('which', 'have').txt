('which', 'have')

which can be pronounced 
if you have providence to excess

which I brought down with qualities
If you have confidence regardless all else

which is the long time I was on
I have them lost

and to which I’ve agreed
I have a memory between the day

which we can pronounce
I have entered my purposes

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,

which feels more comfortable
I have entered my phone

which I feel formerly about for
I have turned it off

which as tracked befitted 
I have them trust in me

which is not necessarily possible
I have seen more than I can remember
