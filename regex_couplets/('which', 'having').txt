('Which', 'Having')

Which is a measure to never live out
Having transitioned from leisure to work

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Having been purchased out of you

Which can be called confidence
Having seen more than 

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
Having seen more than I can remember
