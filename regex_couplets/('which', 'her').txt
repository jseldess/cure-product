('which', 'her')

which can be pronounced 
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

which I brought down with qualities
I’ll get there eventually

from which to step off
there was no promotion

which I needed for an explicit state
but where is it

which is the long time I was on
I get through there

which is all the time
I get from here through there

and to which I’ve agreed
Though we are waiting for her

which we can pronounce
where I send and relive aside

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
where I send and relive would be held

which ran to be told
Where in me did I host

which feels most comfortable
if there is anything 

which feels more comfortable
I presume to others

which as tracked befitted 
Elsewhere by my memory

and to which the plan agreed
there wasn’t any television 

latency which doesn’t mean anything
Where in me did I lose

which is what feels most comfortable
Where in me did I loose

which I feel formerly about for
after though there’s no memory

which as tracked befitted phased
with her waves

which as 
where I send and relive

 as points which are my interest 
I learned the point where I am

which is not necessarily possible
The prospects there already
