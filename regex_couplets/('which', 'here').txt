('Which', 'here')

Which is a measure to never live out
where I sleep at times

Which can be pronounced to the world
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

Which is a pleasure to never live out
here described

Which can be called confidence
Where official policy is to catch and release

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
Where in me did I host
