('which', 'impulse')

which can be pronounced 
impulse control

which I brought down with qualities
I send and retrieve the impulse

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

which ran to be told
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

which as tracked befitted 
I stand and retrieve the impulse

which I feel formerly about for
