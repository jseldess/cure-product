('which', 'into')

which can be pronounced 
into a brigand and a murderer

which I brought down with qualities
into the well controlled climate

from which to step off
talking into pheasants bending themselves

which I needed for an explicit state
Then I saw into you

which is the long time I was on
talking into percents bending themselves

which is like sleep
talking into the cents

which is all the time
entered into my purposes

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed
deep into pathways from repeated travels

which ran to be told
stopping into the prospect

which as tracked befitted 
step by into the prospect

which as tracked befitted phased
converting sight into a purchase

which I feel formerly about for
into liminal reflexing

which is not necessarily possible
at home brought into privacy
