('which', 'literally')

which can be pronounced 
and literally moved

which we can pronounce
as it was designed literally

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
and literally unproved

and to which I’ve agreed
literally unproved 

which ran to be told
myself moved literally as it is

and for which the plan agreed
I literally moved

which feels most comfortable
and move them literally with me

which feels more comfortable
and literally moved about

latency which doesn’t mean anything
literally moved

which is what feels most comfortable
not literally moved about

which as tracked befitted 
not literally moved

which I feel formerly about for
