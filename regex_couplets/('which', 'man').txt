('Which', 'man')

Which is a measure to never live out
To my children Walt Whitman

Which can be pronounced to the world
not many face up

Which is a pleasure to never live out
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

Which can be called confidence
They have very many choices

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
The many transparent pixel calls
