('which', 'me')

which can be pronounced 
Then fall then summer

which I brought down with qualities
In a continuous theme

from which to step off
I had me a vision

which I needed for an explicit state
So I constellate the time family country

which is the long time I was on
I resume attributable visions

which is like sleep
If I take a different measure

which is all the time
the long time I was on

and to which I’ve agreed
by my memory

which we can pronounce
But my not feeling the memory aside

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
already formely a long time

which ran to be told
for not paying sound overwhelmed

latency which doesn’t mean anything
until a happier time found

and for which the plan agreed
Where in me did I host

which feels most comfortable
already formerly a long time

which feels more comfortable
I assumed 

which as tracked befitted 
Elsewhere by my memory

and to which the plan agreed
and that man comes on to tell me 

which is what feels most comfortable
Where in me did I lose

which I feel formerly about for
washed by my memory

which as tracked befitted phased
A way formerly like this one

which as 
By my memory elsewhere

 as points which are my interest 
I have them trust in me

which is not necessarily possible
So I presume the offers already
