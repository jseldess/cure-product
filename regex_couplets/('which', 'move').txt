('which', 'move')

which can be pronounced 
since I can imagine movement

from which to step off
with little reason to move

which I needed for an explicit state
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

and to which I’ve agreed
and literally moved

which we can pronounce
myself moved literally as it is

and for which the plan agreed
I move

which feels most comfortable
when I move

which feels more comfortable
and literally moved about

latency which doesn’t mean anything
I literally moved

which is what feels most comfortable
not literally moved about

which as tracked befitted 
also didn’t really move

which I feel formerly about for
not literally moved

which is not necessarily possible
