('which', 'myself')

which can be pronounced 
I keep turning back again myself

which I brought down with qualities
I was enjoined to act again myself

from which to step off
myself

and for which the plan agreed
the least productive of myself

which I feel formerly about for
So I find myself at home

which as tracked befitted  
So I found myself at home

which is not necessarily possible
