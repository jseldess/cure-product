('which', 'no')

which can be pronounced 
Then I cannot see face value

which I brought down with qualities
in a continuous vertiginous dream

from which to step off
there was no promotion

which I needed for an explicit state
The sun high enough to enter directly 

which is the long time I was on
even when close to my knowing

and to which I’ve agreed
and other types of tracking technology

which we can pronounce
But my not feeling the memory aside

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
But my not feeling the memory inside

which ran to be told
which had on honor to be told

latency which doesn’t mean anything
useless for not having paid

and for which the plan agreed
when it is not literal

which feels most comfortable
and it’s not literal

which feels more comfortable
who knows the way

which I feel formerly about for
not literally moved about

which as tracked befitted 
It’s not marshal exactly

which as tracked befitted phased
from no one point

 as points which are my interest 
Aligned or not with my interests

which is not necessarily possible
for a while not to listen
