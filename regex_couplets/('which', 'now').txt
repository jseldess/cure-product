('Which', 'now')

Which is a measure to never live out
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

Which can be pronounced to the world
out in the snow

Which is a pleasure to never live out
even when close to my knowing

Which can be called confidence
knowing the constituents

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
who knows the way
