('which', 'other')

which can be pronounced 
I’ll pull myself another personality type

from which to step off
On the other hand

which I needed for an explicit state
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

and to which I’ve agreed
and other types of tracking technology

which we can pronounce
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
I presume to others

which as tracked befitted 
to the other end

which as tracked befitted phased
Cereal and others’ health

 as points which are my interest 
I assume possession to others
