('Which', 'our')

Which is a measure to never live out
reasons resources

Which can be pronounced to the world
You can hear it also through your leisure

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Two hours and

Which can be called confidence
or alter of course the time anyway

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
Who throws contours away
