('which', 'over')

which can be pronounced 
hovering above standing water

from which to step off
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

which is the long time I was on
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

and to which I’ve agreed
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
for not paying sound overwhelmed

latency which doesn’t mean anything
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
