('which', 'prospect')

which can be pronounced 
the impulse for my own prospects

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed
the impulse my own prospects

which ran to be told
stopping into the prospect

which as tracked befitted 
speech that is of by prospects

which as tracked befitted phased
for learning by the prospect

which I feel formerly about for
The prospects there already

which is not necessarily possible
