('which', 'prospects')

which can be pronounced 
the impulse for my own prospects

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed
the impulse my own prospects

which ran to be told
speech that is of by prospects

which as tracked befitted  
The prospects there already

which as tracked befitted phased
the prospects being seen by me

which is not necessarily possible
