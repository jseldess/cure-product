('which', 'purchase')

which can be pronounced 
in traversing my purchase

from which to step off
purchased out

and to which I’ve agreed
I have entered my purchases

which we can pronounce
the impulse for my own purchases

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
found dated for my own purchases

which ran to be told
converting sight into a purchase

which as tracked befitted 
for my own purchases

which as 
impulse for my own purchases

which I feel formerly about for
at the site of a purchase

which is not necessarily possible
