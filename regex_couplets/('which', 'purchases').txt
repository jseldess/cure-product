('which', 'purchases')

which can be pronounced 
I tell you the weight of my purchases

and to which I’ve agreed
I have entered my purchases

which we can pronounce
the impulse for my own purchases

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
found dated for my own purchases

which ran to be told
for my own purchases

which as 
impulse for my own purchases

which I feel formerly about for
