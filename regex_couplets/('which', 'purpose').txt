('which', 'purpose')

which can be pronounced 
by no ventillation my purpose

from which to step off
until I purpose the horizon

which is the long time I was on
of my purpose in versing

which is all the time
in traversing my purpose

and to which I’ve agreed
Where I host my purposes

which we can pronounce
the impulse for my own purposes

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
the impulse to my purpose

which ran to be told
to the other end of my purpose

which as tracked befitted 
aside the impulse to my purpose

which I feel formerly about for
for my own purposes

which is not necessarily possible
