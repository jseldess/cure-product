('which', 'really')

which can be pronounced 
When they really take hold of my finger

which I brought down with qualities
That’s when they really take

from which to step off
without really agreeing

which we can pronounce
without really speaking

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
without really breaking

which ran to be told
without really branding 

and for which the plan agreed
without really binding

which feels most comfortable
without really needing

which feels more comfortable
also didn’t really move

which I feel formerly about for
