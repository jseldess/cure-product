('which', 'reason')

which can be pronounced 
reasons resources

which I brought down with qualities
with little reason to move

from which to step off
with little reason to aspiration

which I needed for an explicit state
Toward the start informally given my reasons

which is the long time I was on
More reasons around my country 

which we can pronounce
and could be inflected with reasons

which is not necessarily possible
