('which', 'reasons')

which can be pronounced 
reasons resources

which I brought down with qualities
with little reasons to aspiration

from which to step off
Toward the start informally given my reasons

which is the long time I was on
More reasons around my country 

which we can pronounce
and could be inflected with reasons

which is not necessarily possible
