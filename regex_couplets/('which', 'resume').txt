('which', 'resume')

which can be pronounced 
I resume unassimilable visions

which I needed for an explicit state
I resume attributable visions

which is the long time I was on
I continue to presume

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed
I presume to others

which as tracked befitted 
So I presume the offers already

which as tracked befitted phased
I presume the offers

which is not necessarily possible
I presume to others in kind in possessive terms
