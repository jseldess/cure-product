('which', 'retrieve')

which can be pronounced 
I send and retrieve the impulse

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

which ran to be told
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

which as tracked befitted 
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

which as 
I stand and retrieve the impulse

which I feel formerly about for
