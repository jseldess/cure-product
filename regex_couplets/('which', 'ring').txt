('Which', 'ring')

Which is a measure to never live out
bring your child along

Which can be pronounced to the world
ring

Which is a pleasure to never live out
hovering above standing water

Which can be called confidence
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
firing and connecting somewhere
