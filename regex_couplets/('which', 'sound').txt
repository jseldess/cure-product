('which', 'sound')

which can be pronounced 
sound inundated for my own purchases

and to which I’ve agreed
and sound redundant

which ran to be told
for not paying sound overwhelmed

latency which doesn’t mean anything
by in the sound privacy

which as tracked befitted  
by in the sounded privacy

which as tracked befitted phased
sizes track for asking sound

which I feel formerly about for
buy in the sound privacy

which is not necessarily possible
sizes asking for tracking sound
