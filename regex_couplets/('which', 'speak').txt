('which', 'speak')

which can be pronounced 
not speaking

and to which I’ve agreed already formerly
without really speaking

and to which I’ve agreed
I speak to them

which ran to be told
I speak to them my possessions

which feels more comfortable
I speak them of my possessions

which as tracked befitted 
speak them of my possessions

which as tracked befitted phased
