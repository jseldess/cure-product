('which', 'stand')

which can be pronounced 
hovering above standing water

from which to step off
I stand and retrieve the impulse

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed
where I stand and relive

which ran to be told
to stand and retrieve and pulse around

which as tracked befitted 
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

which as 
where I stand aside

which I feel formerly about for
my standing in data

 as points which are my interest 
I learned the point of standing

which is not necessarily possible
