('which', 'step')

which can be pronounced 
What the next step

from which to step off
step in by the prospect

which as tracked befitted 
phase decision step in

which as tracked befitted phased
step by into the prospect

which I feel formerly about for
stepping in the middle

which is not necessarily possible
stepping off into the middle
