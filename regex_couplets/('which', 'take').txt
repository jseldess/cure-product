('which', 'take')

which can be pronounced 
I take hold of my finger

which I brought down with qualities
When they really take hold of my finger

from which to step off
If I take a different measure

which I needed for an explicit state
If I take some different measure

which is the long time I was on
to take the call

which ran to be told
and it doesnâ€™t take long

which I feel formerly about for
