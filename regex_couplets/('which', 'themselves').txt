('which', 'themselves')

which can be pronounced 
talking into pheasants bending themselves

from which to step off
talking into percents bending themselves

which is the long time I was on
walking into percents blending themselves

which is like sleep
battery dawn nights blending themselves

which is all the time
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

which ran to be told
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

which as tracked befitted 
battery dawn nights ending themselves

 as points which are my interest
