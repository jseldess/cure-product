('which', 'through')

which can be pronounced 
You can hear it also through your leisure

which I brought down with qualities
Back up through the results

from which to step off
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

which I needed for an explicit state
I get through there

which is all the time
I get from here through there

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed
