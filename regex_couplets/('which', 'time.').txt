('Which', 'time.')

Which is a measure to never live out
where I sleep at times

Which can be pronounced to the world
So I constellate the time family country

Which is a pleasure to never live out
 and time in the train

Which can be called confidence
The long time I had a vision

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
formerly along time they were on
