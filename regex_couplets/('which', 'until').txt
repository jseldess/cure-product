('which', 'until')

which can be pronounced 
until my purpose up in the sky

from which to step off
until I could not tire 

which I needed for an explicit state
until I could not be tired

which is the long time I was on
until I purpose up in the sky

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed
until a happier time found

and for which the plan agreed
