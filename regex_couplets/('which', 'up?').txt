('Which', 'up?')

Which is a measure to never live out
as a pure product

Which can be pronounced to the world
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

Which is a pleasure to never live out
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

Which can be called confidence
upset by Gingrich

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
in the form filled offered in trust
