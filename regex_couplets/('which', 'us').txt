('Which', 'us')

Which is a measure to never live out
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

Which can be pronounced to the world
I want to cite a poem so usual

Which is a pleasure to never live out
was not just a defeat

Which can be called confidence
I have them trust in me

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
in the form filled offered in trust
