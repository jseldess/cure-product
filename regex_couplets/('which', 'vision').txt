('which', 'vision')

which can be pronounced 
I had me a vision

from which to step off
aspirating with little visions

which I needed for an explicit state
The long time I had a vision

which is the long time I was on
I resume attributable visions

which is like sleep
attributable visions

and to which I’ve agreed
there wasn’t any television 

which feels more comfortable
joined in my television

which I feel formerly about for
visions that can be attainable

which is not necessarily possible
revisions that can be attributable
