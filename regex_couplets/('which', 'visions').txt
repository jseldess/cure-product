('which', 'visions')

which can be pronounced 
The planning process for visions

from which to step off
aspirating with little visions

which I needed for an explicit state
I resume attributable visions

which is the long time I was on
attributable visions

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed
visions that can be attainable

which is not necessarily possible
revisions that can be attributable
