('which', 'watch')

which can be pronounced 
when watching tv

from which to step off
in the sense of watching

which is like sleep
I watch a movie

which is all the time
I watch a moving afterimage

and to which I’ve agreed
When I'm watching my tv 

which feels more comfortable
so still watch them

which I feel formerly about for
where I’m watching my tv

 as points which are my interest
