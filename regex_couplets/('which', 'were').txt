('which', 'were')

which can be pronounced 
When we had jobs that were to earn

which I brought down with qualities
I wish my desires were open

from which to step off
The days were long aligned

which I needed for an explicit state
they were on

and to which Iâ€™ve agreed
formerly a long time they were on

which we can pronounce
answered about 

which ran to be told
by the sight of the hosting answered about

which I feel formerly about for
washed I answered about

which as tracked befitted 
I answered what I thought

which as tracked befitted phased
I answered about

which as 
in the long time they were on

 as points which are my interest 
that they were visible

which is not necessarily possible
that they were divisible
