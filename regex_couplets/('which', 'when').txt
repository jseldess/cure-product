('Which', 'When')

Which is a measure to never live out
When we had jobs that were to earn

Which can be pronounced to the world
When they really take hold of my finger

Which is a pleasure to never live out
When closed to my knowing

Which can be called confidence
When I'm watching my tv 

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
