('which', 'work')

which can be pronounced 
nor work in this way daily

which I brought down with qualities
Having transitioned from leisure to work

from which to step off
I need the work

which I needed for an explicit state
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

which is the long time I was on
nor envy honest work

which we can pronounce
