('Which', 'you.')

Which is a measure to never live out
bring your child along

Which can be pronounced to the world
You can hear it also through your leisure

Which is a pleasure to never live out
if you have providence to excess

Which can be called confidence
May I have your zip code

Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
the young ripples inaudibly
