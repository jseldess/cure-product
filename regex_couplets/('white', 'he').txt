('white', 'he')

white spots on a black surface
falling off the encoded end

black spots on a white surface
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

a futile joyous white sun
Black for the pines, black for the cypresses

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
that of the man with the dyed blond hair
