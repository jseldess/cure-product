('who', 'For')

Ask who I am to suspend
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

For whom drifting is not an exception
For whom 

who are so fresh and agile
Forecasting the story before dawn

who knows the way
Formerly a way like this one

who knows how to turn it off
Formerly away there are constant ways

who know the ways to their other end
Forty-one seconds in I end up Bach
