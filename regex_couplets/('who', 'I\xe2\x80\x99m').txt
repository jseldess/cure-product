('who', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

Ask who I am to suspend
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

who knows the way
I’m simply inside

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Right now I’m the cart

who
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

who knows how to turn it off
where I’m watching my tv
