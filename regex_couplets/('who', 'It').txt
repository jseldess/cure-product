('who', 'It')

Ask who I am to suspend
It’s time to wake up, Papa!

who knows the way
It keeps coming down thankfully

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
It has been since

who
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

who knows how to turn it off
It’s not marshal exactly

who throws contours a way
