('who', 'There')

Ask who I am to suspend
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
There are quarterly goals

who
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

whom 
There was very little physical activity

who knows the way
There are constant ways

who know the ways to their other end
There are no constant waves
