('who', 'We')

Ask who I am to suspend
We’ll have coffee this morning

Ask who I am to end my live connection
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

who knows the way
We can wrestle them with their goals

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
We had to say goodbye there

who knows how to turn it off
We ask say in that case
