('who', 'actions')

Ask who I am to suspend
conversations with our reactions

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
to the ends of my transactions

who knows the way
To the ends of transactions

who knows how to turn it off
the ends of my transactions

who throws contours a way
The other end of transactions like this

who know the ways to their other end
The other ends of my transactions
