('who', 'any')

Ask who I am to suspend
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

who knows the way
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
at any time it can drift again

whom 
Or the company

who knows how to turn it off
The many transparent pixel calls

who know the way to their other end
The many transparent pixels call
