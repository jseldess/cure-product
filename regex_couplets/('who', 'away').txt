('who', 'away')

Ask who I am to suspend
drifting away

who knows the way
drifting away needs others presume desires

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
drifting away needs

who
drifting away from the task

whom 
Who throws contours away

who throws contours a way
Formerly away there are constant ways

who know the ways to their other end
formerly away
