('who', 'child')

Ask who I am to suspend
On a snow day with my children

who knows the way
about my childrenâ€™s consumption

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
To my children Walt Whitman

For whom drifting is not an exception
To my children

For whom 
bring your child along

who are so fresh and agile
even my child

who knows how to turn it off
my possession of my children
