('who', 'do')

Ask who I am to suspend
The dogs and lillies

Ask who I am
in a sharp downward turn 

who knows the way
In a sharp downard turn

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
What does it mean to drift

who are so fresh and agile
to the down arrow

whom 
I brought my head down

who knows how to turn it off
and it doesnâ€™t take long
