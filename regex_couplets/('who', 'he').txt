('who', 'he')

Ask who I am to suspend
But that is beside the point

You should ask who I am
Whereas direction is beside the point

Ask who I am
Where I sleep at times

Ask who I am to end my live connection
The dogs and lillies

who knows the way
battery dawn nights blending themselves

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Then I constellate my time family country

For whom drifting is not an exception
without imparting the cynicism

who are so fresh and agile
the drifting is not something special

who
here described

whom 
the latter

who knows how to turn it off
Though we are waiting for her

who throws contours a way
to the ends of my transactions

who know the ways to their other end
But my not feeling the memory inside

who know the way to their other end
The many transparent pixels call
