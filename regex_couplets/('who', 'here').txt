('who', 'here')

Ask who I am to suspend
Where I sleep at times

You should ask who I am
Whereas direction is beside the point

Ask who I am
The prospects there already

who knows the way
Of course there is a direction

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

who
here described

whom 
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

who knows how to turn it off
Is there a baby and a bear

who throws contours a way
There are constant ways

who know the ways to their other end
There are no constant waves
