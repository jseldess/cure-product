('who', 'if')

Ask who I am to suspend
drifting away

who knows the way
if not directly on my skin

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
For whom drifting is not an exception

For whom 
What does it mean to drift

who are so fresh and agile
the drifting is not something special

who
drifting away needs others presume desires

whom 
if you have providence to excess

who knows how to turn it off
if only on the way to the trash
