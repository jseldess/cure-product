('who', 'inter')

Ask who I am to suspend
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

who knows the way
interjecting on a day ambition

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
way high up in the inter

whom 
hold at intervals riding forward

who knows how to turn it off
my interfaced stand data
