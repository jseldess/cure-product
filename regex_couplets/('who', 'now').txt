('who', 'now')

Ask who I am to suspend
On a snow day with my children

who knows the way
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

who
out in the snow

whom 
out in the snow fall

who knows how to turn it off
Selma knows too 

who throws contours a way
who know the ways to their other end

who know the way to their other end
that their knowing
