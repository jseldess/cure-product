('who', 'our')

Ask who I am to suspend
reasons resources

who knows the way
conversations with our purchase

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
bring your child along

who are so fresh and agile
You can hear it also through your leisure

whom 
Two hours and

who knows how to turn it off
Who throws contours away

who throws contours a way
The contours exchange with you

who know the ways to their other end
phrase them of our possessions
