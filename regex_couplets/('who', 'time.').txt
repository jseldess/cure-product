('who', 'time.')

Ask who I am to suspend
Where I sleep at times

You should ask who I am
Then I constellate my time family country

who knows the way
only fragments of time with my children

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
over the long time up in the sky

who
at any time it can drift again

whom 
So I constellate the time family country

who knows how to turn it off
formerly along time they were on
