('who', 'turn')

Ask who I am to suspend
in a sharp downward turn 

who knows the way
In a sharp downard turn

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
sudden downward turn

whom 
I keep turning back again myself

who knows how to turn it off
Bach helps turn it off

who throws contours a way
I turn not sad exactly
