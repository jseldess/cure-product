('who', 'us')

Ask who I am to suspend
I am to end my connections suspended live

You should ask who I am
I suspend live connections to you

Ask who I am
Suspended live in connections to you

who knows the way
Intersecting the skin smile sweetness potential for injustice

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

who
I want to cite a poem so usual

whom 
was not just a defeat

who knows how to turn it off
radiating from housing
