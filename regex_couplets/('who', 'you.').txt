('who', 'you.')

Ask who I am to suspend
Though how can you know without direction

For whom drifting does not feel an exception
bring your child along

who are so fresh and agile
You can hear it also through your leisure

whom 
if you have providence to excess

who knows the way
the young ripples inaudibly
