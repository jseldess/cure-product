('will', 'Thou')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
Though there are quarters goals

will not be the same
Though in not many acts

that will spur me on
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

would only willingly break
Though we are waiting 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Though we are waiting for her

my daughter will learn 
Though we can’t help waiting
