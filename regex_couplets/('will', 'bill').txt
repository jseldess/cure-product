('will', 'bill')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
I hear it between bills and stuff

will not be the same
I can hear them between bills and stuff

that will spur me on
until the bill came

would only willingly break
the bill my detuning 

my daughter will learn 
bills and stuffed animals
