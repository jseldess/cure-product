('will', 'child')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
on a snow day with my children

on a day there will be direction
especially in a child

will not be the same
even my child

would only willingly break
my possession of my children

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
speech my possession of my children

my daughter will learn
