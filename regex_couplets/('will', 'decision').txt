('will', 'decision')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
the planning process for decisions

will not be the same
attributable decisions

would only willingly break
forgetting decisions 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
decisioned to learn 

my daughter will learn 
that decisions can be attributable
