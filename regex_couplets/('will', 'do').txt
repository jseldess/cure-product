('will', 'do')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
does not feel an exception

will not be the same
What I do in my liesure

that will spur me on
here is the site of the battle of maldon

would only willingly break
latency which doesn’t mean anything

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
and it doesn’t take long

my daughter will learn 
I only think I don’t listen
