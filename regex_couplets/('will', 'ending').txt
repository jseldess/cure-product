('will', 'ending')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
I tried to feel the key values extending 

will not be the same
talking into pheasants bending themselves

that will spur me on
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

would only willingly break
battery dawn nights blending themselves

my daughter will learn 
battery dawn nights ending themselves
