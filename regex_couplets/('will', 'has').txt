('will', 'has')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
It has been since

will not be the same
in traversing my purchase

that will spur me on
purchased out

would only willingly break
if that has anything

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
phase decisioned by the prospect

my daughter will learn 
converting sight into a purchase
