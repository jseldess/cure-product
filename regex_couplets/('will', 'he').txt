('will', 'he')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
Then fall then summer

on a day there will be direction
interjecting into the stream

will not be the same
The first track

that will spur me on
in pursuit of the sight

that will try me on 
even when close to my owning

would only willingly break
only with the latency 

would speak willingly only
with the latency last night

would only willingly speak
knowing the constituents

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

my daughter will learn 
buy in the surrounded privacy
