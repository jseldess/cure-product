('will', 'here')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
on a day there will be direction

will not be the same
there was no television to hear

that will spur me on
I get through there

that will try me on 
I get from here through there

would only willingly break
Where in me did I host

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Elsewhere by my memory

my daughter will learn 
Is there a baby and a bear
