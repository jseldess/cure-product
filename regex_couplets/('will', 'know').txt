('will', 'know')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
how can I know without direction

will not be the same
even when close to my knowing

would only willingly break
knowing the constituents

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
who knows the way

my daughter will learn 
who knows how to turn it off
