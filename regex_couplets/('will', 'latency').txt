('will', 'latency')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
with latency from constituents

would speak willingly 
only with the latency 

would speak willingly only
with the latency last night

would only willingly speak
with a latency last night

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
latency which doesnâ€™t mean anything

my daughter will learn
