('will', 'man')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

will not be the same
not many face up

that will spur me on
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

would only willingly break
and that man comes on to tell me 

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
The many transparent pixel calls

my daughter will learn
