('will', 'now')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
on a snow day with my children

on a day there will be direction
Daniel Tiger on a snow day

will not be the same
I think I take it out into the snow fall thatâ€™s not sticking

that will spur me on
even when close to my knowing

would only willingly break
knowing the constituents

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
who knows the way

my daughter will learn 
who knows how to turn it off
