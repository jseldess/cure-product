('will', 'redundant')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
and sound redundant

would only willingly break
and found redundant

would speak willingly only
and around redundant

would only willingly speak
for not paying redundant

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
redundant

my daughter will learn
