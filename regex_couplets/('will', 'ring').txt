('will', 'ring')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
interferring 

On a day there will be direction
bring your child along

will not be the same
actually considering the end

that will spur me on
storing in surfeit

would only willingly break
firing and connecting somewhere

my daughter will learn 
The prospect for veering healthily
