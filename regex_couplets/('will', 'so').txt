('will', 'so')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
You can hear it also through your leisure

will not be the same
If I take some different measure

that will spur me on
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

would only willingly break
for not paying sound overwhelmed

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
so still watch them

my daughter will learn 
sizes track for asking sound
