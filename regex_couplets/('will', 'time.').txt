('will', 'time.')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
only fragments of time with my children

on a day there will be direction
where I sleep at times

will not be the same
The long time I had a vision

that will spur me on
or alter of course the time anyway

would only willingly break
until a happier time found

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
formerly along time they were on

my daughter will learn 
time they were on
