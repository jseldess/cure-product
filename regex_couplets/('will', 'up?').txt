('will', 'up?')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
Then fall then summer

on a day there will be direction
interjecting into the stream of pictures

will not be the same
that I hear without trying

that will spur me on
in conversing of my purpose

that will try me on 
If I take some different measure

would only willingly break
from my constituents

would only speak willingly
with latency from constituents

would speak willingly 
all parties would be held

would speak willingly only
would only willingly speak

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

my daughter will learn 
buy in the surrounded privacy
