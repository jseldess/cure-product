('will', 'us')

interjecting on a day there will be ambition
Theyâ€™re just not mine

will not be the same
I refuse indelible tracts

that will spur me on
a futile joyous white sun

would only willingly break
useless for not having paid

Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.

my daughter will learn 
radiating from housing
