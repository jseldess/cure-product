('without', 'A')

how can I know without direction
As though stationary and a destination

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
And as an extension of the values

learned without too much difficulty to code
THE PLANNING PROCESS

without the long time I was accounting
All that I can think I want

without the long time I was on accounting
COPY DREAM 

without ensuing damage
As a clone, illegally conceived

without consumer damage
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

without really agreeing
And we could inhabit the room easy

without really speaking
All parties would be held for my own purchases

without really breaking
CONTRACT

without really needing
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
