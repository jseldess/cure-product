('without', 'For')

how can I know without direction
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

without imparting the cynicism
Forecasting the story before dawn

learned without too much difficulty to code
For an ungraspable time

without ensuing damage
For Mitt Romney

without really speaking
For my own purchases

without really breaking
Formerly a way like this one
