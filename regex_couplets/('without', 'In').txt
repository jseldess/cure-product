('without', 'IN')

how can I know without direction
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

learned without too much difficulty to code
THE PLANNING PROCESS

without the long time I was accounting
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

without ensuing damage
By NATASHA SINGER

without really speaking
PRELUDE (IN A MINOR) WITH MY DAUGHTER
