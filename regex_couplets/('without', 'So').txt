('without', 'so')

how can I know without direction
You can hear it also through your leisure

and without quartely goals
reasons resources

without imparting the cynicism
who are so fresh and agile

learned without too much difficulty to code
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

without the long time I was accounting
no solid ground to continue along

that I hear without trying
If I take some different measure

without the long time I was on accounting
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

without ensuing damage
so that nothing had gravity

My means without gravity
some sort of a futile joyous white sun

without really agreeing
I want to cite a poem so usual

without really speaking
sound inundated for my own purchases

without really breaking
firing and connecting somewhere

without really branding 
so still watch them
