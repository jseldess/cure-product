('without', 'That')

how can I know without direction
That is itself not still

I can’t fix them without direction
That’s where I sleep at times

learned without too much difficulty to code
That you can see only the back of

without the long time I was accounting
That I captured an afterimage

without consumer damage
That are my right to say
