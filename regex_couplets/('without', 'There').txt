('without', 'There')

how can I know without direction
There are quarterly goals

learned without too much difficulty to code
There was very little physical activity

without the long time I was accounting
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

without the long time I was on accounting
There are spots waiting

without ensuing damage
There are constant ways
