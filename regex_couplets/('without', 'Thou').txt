('without', 'Thou')

how can I know without direction
Though there are quarters goals

I can’t fix them without direction
Though how can you know without direction

for how can you know without direction
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

without the long time I was accounting
Though in not many acts

without the long time I was on accounting
Though we are waiting for her

without really agreeing
Though we are breaking 

without really speaking
Though we are waiting 

without really binding
Though we can’t help waiting
