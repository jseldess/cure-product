('without', 'though')

how can I know without direction
As though stationary and a destination

I can’t fix them without direction
though there are quarters with goals

for how can you know without direction
though it was most emphatically that

learned without too much difficulty to code
I had nightmares though

without the long time I was accounting
though not many freeze up

without the long time I was on accounting
I thought

without really agreeing
though we are still breaking in

without really speaking
though we are breaking in the space that it had

without really breaking
after though there’s no memory
