('without', 'To')

how can I know without direction
To my children Walt Whitman

and without quartely goals
To my chidren

without imparting the cynicism
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

learned without too much difficulty to code
Tomorrow 

without the long time I was accounting
Toward the start informally given my reasons

without the long time I was on accounting
To neither study

without really speaking
To the ends of transactions
