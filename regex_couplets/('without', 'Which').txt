('without', 'Which')

how can I know without direction
Which is a measure to never live out

and without quartely goals
Which can be pronounced to the world

learned without too much difficulty to code
Which is a pleasure to never live out

without the long time I was accounting
Which can be called confidence

without really speaking
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
