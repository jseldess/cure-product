('without', 'while')

how can I know without direction
Looking back while I should be sleeping

learned without too much difficulty to code
while wrapped in static

without the long time I was accounting
while wrapped in explicit static

without the long time I was on accounting
while consuming damage

without ensuing damage
I answered while interfaced
