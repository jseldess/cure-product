('without', 'You')

how can I know without direction
You can hear it also through your leisure

and without quartely goals
You use the most essential parts

learned without too much difficulty to code
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

without the long time I was accounting
You can hear it also through static leisure

without the long time I was on accounting
You can have seen offering
