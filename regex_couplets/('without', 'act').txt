('without', 'act')

how can I know without direction
I was enjoined to act again myself

learned without too much difficulty to code
and strategies not tactics

without the long time I was accounting
actually considering the end

without the long time I was on accounting
we had inhabited actually

without really agreeing
The ends of my transactions

without really branding 
to the ends of my transactions

without really needing
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
