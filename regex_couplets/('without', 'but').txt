('without', 'but')

how can I know without direction
but not impart cynicism

and without quartely goals
Attributable or

learned without too much difficulty to code
but the sun isnâ€™t up

without the long time I was accounting
but they are black spots

that I hear without trying
but I can hear them

without the long time I was on accounting
I resume attributable visions

without ensuing damage
attributable visions

without consumer damage
that decisions can be attributable
