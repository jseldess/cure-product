('without', 'children')

how can I know without direction
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

and without quartely goals
To my children Walt Whitman

without imparting the cynicism
bearing children along

learned without too much difficulty to code
Even the children

without ensuing damage
my possession of my children

without really agreeing
speech my possession of my children
