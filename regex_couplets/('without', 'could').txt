('without', 'could')

how can I know without direction
and could be mapped and weighed

learned without too much difficulty to code
until I could not tire 

without the long time I was accounting
until I could not be tired

without the long time I was on accounting
I could in effect credit

without ensuing damage
I could consume the dream

without consumer damage
and we could inhabit the room easy

without really agreeing
and could be inflected with reasons
