('without', 'edge')

how can I know without direction
The edge is put in place

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
I step off the edge

Though how can you know without direction
I step over the edge

for how can you know without direction
If I step over the edge

and without quartely goals
off the edge of the world

learned without too much difficulty to code
and testing the edge and gravity

without the long time I was accounting
