('without', 'form')

how can I know without direction
There are performance reviews

learned without too much difficulty to code
Toward the start informally given my reasons

without the long time I was accounting
already formerly a long time

without really agreeing
A way formerly like this one

without really speaking
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

without really breaking
already formely a long time

without really branding 
in the form filled offered in trust

without really binding
with dawn already formerly nights 

without really needing
in the form filled offered trust
