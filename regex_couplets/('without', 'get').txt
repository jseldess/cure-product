('without', 'get')

how can I know without direction
I’ll get there eventually

and without quartely goals
and without a proposed budget

without imparting the cynicism
I’ll get there ruins

learned without too much difficulty to code
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

without the long time I was accounting
I get through there

without ensuing damage
in traversing get through there

without consumer damage
forgetting decisions 

without really agreeing
forgettable
