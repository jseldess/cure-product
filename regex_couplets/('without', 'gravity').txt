('without', 'gravity')

how can I know without direction
and testing the edge and gravity

without the long time I was accounting
where I need gravity

without ensuing damage
Where I lead gravity

without consumer damage
that nothing had gravity

My means without gravity
so that nothing had gravity

without longer damage
