('without', 'he')

how can I know without direction
The edge is put in place

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
there are quarters 

Though how can you know without direction
I step over the edge

for how can you know without direction
If I step over the edge

and without quartely goals
Then I constellate my time family country

without imparting the cynicism
the drifting is not something special

learned without too much difficulty to code
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

without the long time I was accounting
Where I take my liesure

What would I feel without that goal
there was no promotion

that I hear without trying
The first language

without the long time I was on accounting
without accounting the long time I was on

without accounting for credit
which is the long time I was on

without ensuing damage
under the last seen principle

without consumer damage
Then I continue to dream then

My means without gravity
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

without longer damage
I continued to dream then

without any further damage
until the bill came

without any longer damage
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

without really agreeing
if there is anything 

without really speaking
though we are breaking in the space that it had

without really breaking
they should rise up

without really branding 
the 

without really binding myself
uses for the attention of the brand

without really binding
when I move

without their agreement
The floor slanted in places

without really needing
and to which the plan agreed
