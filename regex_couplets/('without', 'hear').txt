('without', 'hear')

how can I know without direction
You can hear it also through your leisure

and without quartely goals
and my heart rate

learned without too much difficulty to code
I hear it between bills and stuff

without the long time I was accounting
I can hear it between bills and stuff

What would I feel without that goal
that I can hear

that I hear without trying
as far back as my history heard

without the long time I was on accounting
In my heart did I lose trust
