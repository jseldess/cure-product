('without', 'her')

how can I know without direction
The edge isn’t even there

I can’t fix them without direction
there are quarters 

Though how can you know without direction
though there are quarters with goals

for how can you know without direction
what I find there

and without quartely goals
where I sleep at times

without imparting the cynicism
I’ll pull myself another personality type

learned without too much difficulty to code
there was no promotion

without the long time I was accounting
Where I take my liesure

What would I feel without that goal
But would I love her the same

that I hear without trying
On the other hand

without the long time I was on accounting
I get through there

without ensuing damage
in traversing get through there

without consumer damage
redbud and cherry and one wild apple tree

without longer damage
without any further damage

My means without gravity
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

without really agreeing
if there is anything 

without really speaking
where I send and relive would be held

without really breaking
where I send and relive

without really branding 
Where in me did I host

without really binding
Though we are waiting for her

without really needing
there wasn’t any television
