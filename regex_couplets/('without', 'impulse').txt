('without', 'impulse')

how can I know without direction
impulse control

learned without too much difficulty to code
I send and retrieve the impulse

without really speaking
I send and retrieve aside the impulse

without really breaking
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

without really branding 
I stand and retrieve the impulse
