('without', 'just')

how can I know without direction
Theyâ€™re just not mine

for how can you know without direction
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

learned without too much difficulty to code
I just got a letter

without the long time I was accounting
it was not just a defeat

without the long time I was on accounting
was not just a defeat

without really speaking
