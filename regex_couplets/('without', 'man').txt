('without', 'man')

how can I know without direction
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

and without quartely goals
To my children Walt Whitman

without imparting the cynicism
Walt Whitman drifted

learned without too much difficulty to code
not many face up

without the long time I was accounting
though not many facts up in the sky

without the long time I was on accounting
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

without really agreeing
They have very many choices

without really speaking
and that man comes on to tell me
