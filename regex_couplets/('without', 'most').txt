('without', 'most')

how can I know without direction
though it was most emphatically that

learned without too much difficulty to code
I invited most of what came next

without the long time I was accounting
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

without really speaking
which feels most comfortable

without really binding
most comfortable
