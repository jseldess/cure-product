('without', 'our')

how can I know without direction
You can hear it also through your leisure

and without quartely goals
reasons resources

without imparting the cynicism
Two hours and

learned without too much difficulty to code
with four key value pairs

without the long time I was accounting
or alter of course the time anyway

without really agreeing
This is your voice 

without really speaking
Who throws contours away
