('without', 'over')

how can I know without direction
I step over the edge

for how can you know without direction
If I step over the edge

and without quartely goals
over the long time up in the sky

learned without too much difficulty to code
oddly grown over with historic bark

without the long time I was accounting
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

without the long time I was on accounting
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

without ensuing damage
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

without really speaking
for not paying sound overwhelmed

without really branding 
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
