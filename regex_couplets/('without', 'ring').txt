('without', 'ring')

how can I know without direction
bring your child along

without imparting the cynicism
bearing children along

learned without too much difficulty to code
actually considering the end

without the long time I was accounting
the simple act of honoring an accountant

without the long time I was on accounting
storing in surfeit

without ensuing damage
firing and connecting somewhere

without really branding 
The prospect for veering healthily
