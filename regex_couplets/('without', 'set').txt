('without', 'set')

how can I know without direction
upset by Gingrich

learned without too much difficulty to code
in front of the set afternoon

without the long time I was accounting
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

without really agreeing
Um, upset by Gingrich

without really speaking
presets
