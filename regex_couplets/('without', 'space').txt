('without', 'space')

how can I know without direction
in rotating directionless space

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
into rotating and directionless space

Though how can you know without direction
and then into rotating and directional space

for how can you know without direction
into directionless space

and without quartely goals
in the space that it had

without really agreeing
though we are breaking in the space that it had

without really speaking
in the fill space
