('without', 'step')

how can I know without direction
I step off the edge

I canâ€™t fix them without direction
I step over the edge

for how can you know without direction
If I step over the edge

and without quartely goals
What the next step

without the long time I was accounting
from which to step off

that I hear without trying
step in by the prospect
