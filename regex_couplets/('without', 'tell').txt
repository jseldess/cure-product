('without', 'tell')

how can I know without direction
Then I constellate my time family country

without imparting the cynicism
So I constellate the time family country

learned without too much difficulty to code
I had to tell them the news

without the long time I was accounting
I tell you my purposes

without ensuing damage
I tell you the weight of my purchases

without consumer damage
and that man comes on to tell me
