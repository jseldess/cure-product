('without', 'through')

how can I know without direction
You can hear it also through your leisure

and without quartely goals
Back up through the results

learned without too much difficulty to code
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

without the long time I was accounting
I cannot clear it also through investiture

without the long time I was on accounting
I get through there

without ensuing damage
in traversing get through there

without consumer damage
