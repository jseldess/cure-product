('without', 'until')

how can I know without direction
until my purpose up in the sky

learned without too much difficulty to code
until I could not tire 

without the long time I was accounting
until I could not be tired

without the long time I was on accounting
until I purpose up in the sky

without ensuing damage
until I purchase up the sky

without consumer damage
until the bill came

My means without gravity
until a happier time found

without really branding
