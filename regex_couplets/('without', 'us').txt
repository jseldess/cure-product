('without', 'us')

how can I know without direction
russling to stay still

I can’t fix them without direction
They’re just not mine

for how can you know without direction
slow asynchronous

and without quartely goals
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

learned without too much difficulty to code
The ventillation rushes on

without the long time I was accounting
because there was no solid ground to continue along

that I hear without trying
I refuse indelible tracts

without the long time I was on accounting
I have them trust in me

without ensuing damage
a futile joyous white sun

without consumer damage
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

without really agreeing
I want to cite a poem so usual

without really speaking
in the form filled offered in trust

without really breaking
useless for not having paid

without really binding myself
uses for the attention of the brand

without really binding
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
