('without', 'use')

how can I know without direction
You use the most essential parts

learned without too much difficulty to code
I reuse unassimilable visions

without the long time I was accounting
because there was no solid ground to continue along

that I hear without trying
I refuse indelible tracts

without the long time I was on accounting
I used my technology

without ensuing damage
trackers collecting data on users

without really speaking
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

without really breaking
useless for not having paid

without really binding myself
uses for the attention of the brand

without really binding
