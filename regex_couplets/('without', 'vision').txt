('without', 'vision')

how can I know without direction
I had me a vision

learned without too much difficulty to code
The planning process for visions

without the long time I was accounting
there wasnâ€™t any television 

that I hear without trying
I resume unassimilable visions

without the long time I was on accounting
I resume attributable visions

without ensuing damage
attributable visions

without consumer damage
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

without really agreeing
joined in my television
