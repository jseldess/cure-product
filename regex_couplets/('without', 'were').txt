('without', 'were')

how can I know without direction
When we had jobs that were to earn

learned without too much difficulty to code
I argued the days were longer

without the long time I was accounting
they were on

without ensuing damage
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

without really agreeing
answered about 

without really branding 
formerly a long time they were on

without really needing
by the sight of the hosting answered about
