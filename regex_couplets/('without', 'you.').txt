('without', 'you.')

how can I know without direction
Though how can you know without direction

for how can you know without direction
You can hear it also through your leisure

and without quartely goals
bring your child along

without imparting the cynicism
if you have providence to excess

learned without too much difficulty to code
That you can see only the back of

without the long time I was accounting
where you can earn more 

that I hear without trying
If you have confidence regardless all else

without the long time I was on accounting
a futile joyous white sun

without ensuing damage
I tell you my purposes

without consumer damage
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

without really agreeing
This is your voice 

without really speaking
the young ripples inaudibly
