('without', 'your')

how can I know without direction
You can hear it also through your leisure

and without quartely goals
bring your child along

without imparting the cynicism
May I have your zip code

learned without too much difficulty to code
your bid to the next highest ranked network

without the long time I was accounting
This is your voice 

without really speaking
