('work', 'IN')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

nor work in this way daily
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

Having transitioned from leisure to work
THE PLANNING PROCESS

your bid to the next highest ranked network
ASPIRATING VISIONS

I need the work
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

nor envy honest work
