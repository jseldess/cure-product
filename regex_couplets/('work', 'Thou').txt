('work', 'Thou')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Though there are quarters goals

nor work in this way daily
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

I need the work
Though in not many acts

I walk up and don’t work anymore
Though we are waiting for her

nor envy honest work
Though we are breaking
