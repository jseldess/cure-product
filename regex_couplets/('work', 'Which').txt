('work', 'Which')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Which is a measure to never live out

nor work in this way daily
Which is a pleasure to never live out

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
Which can be called confidence

nor envy honest work
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
