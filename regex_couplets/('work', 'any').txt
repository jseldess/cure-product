('work', 'any')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Before anyone walks across the wide opening

nor work in this way daily
Or the company

Having transitioned from leisure to work
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I need the work
though not many freeze up

I walk up and don’t work anymore
So I look up and don’t walk any

So I work and don’t look any
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

nor envy honest work
They have very many choices
