('work', 'bill')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
I hear it between bills and stuff

Having transitioned from leisure to work
I can hear it between bills and stuff

I need the work
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
billowing in the cloud

nor work in this way daily
the bill my detuning
