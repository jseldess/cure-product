('work', 'call')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
not calling or echoing for once

nor work in this way daily
They are called aspirational

your bid to the next highest ranked network
though it was most emphatically that

So I work and donâ€™t look any
Which can be called confidence

nor envy honest work
to take the call
