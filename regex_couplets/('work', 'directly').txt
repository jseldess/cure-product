('work', 'directly')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
if not directly on my skin

nor work in this way daily
But not to me directly

Having transitioned from leisure to work
The sun high enough to enter directly 

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
The sun high enough to strike directly
