('work', 'do')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
In a sharp downard turn

nor work in this way daily
I brought my head down

Having transitioned from leisure to work
So that I don’t notice I am the only one

your bid to the next highest ranked network
What I do in my liesure

I need the work
I walk up and don’t work anymore

So I work and don’t look any
here is the site of the battle of maldon

nor envy honest work
and it doesn’t take long
