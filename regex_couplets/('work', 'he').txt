('work', 'he')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

nor work in this way daily
The South Carolina primary 

Having transitioned from leisure to work
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

your bid to the next highest ranked network
the next network in your ranking

I need the work
up in the television pleasure

I walk up and don’t work anymore
advancing the time

So I work and don’t look any
but where is it

nor envy honest work
To neither study
