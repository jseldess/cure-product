('work', 'here')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Of course there is a direction

nor work in this way daily
I’ll get there eventually

Having transitioned from leisure to work
there was no promotion

I need the work
there was no television to hear

I walk up and don’t work anymore
but where is it

nor envy honest work
and elsewhere my memory of you
