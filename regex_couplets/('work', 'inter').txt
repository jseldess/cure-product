('work', 'inter')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

nor work in this way daily
hold at intervals riding forward

Having transitioned from leisure to work
with internally regulated climate

your bid to the next highest ranked network
Then I saw them interview

nor envy honest work
my interfaced stand data
