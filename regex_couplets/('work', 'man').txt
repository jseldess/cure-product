('work', 'man')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

nor work in this way daily
not many face up

I need the work
though not many freeze up

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

nor envy honest work
They have very many choices
