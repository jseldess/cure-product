('work', 'now')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
on a snow day with my children

nor work in this way daily
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

Having transitioned from leisure to work
out in the snow

your bid to the next highest ranked network
I take it out in the snow fall

I need the work
even when close to my knowing

nor envy honest work
knowing the constituents
