('work', 'ring')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
interferring 

nor work in this way daily
hovering above standing water

Having transitioned from leisure to work
actually considering the end

I need the work
the simple act of honoring an accountant

I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

nor envy honest work
firing and connecting somewhere
