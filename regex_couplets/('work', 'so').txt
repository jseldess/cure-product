('work', 'so')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
When I want something

nor work in this way daily
A person from a distance

Having transitioned from leisure to work
I get up soon and talk in front imaged

your bid to the next highest ranked network
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

I need the work
If I take some different measure

I walk up and don’t work anymore
Toward the start informally given my reasons

So I work and don’t look any
More reasons 

nor envy honest work
More reasons around my country
