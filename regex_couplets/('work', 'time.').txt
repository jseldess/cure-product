('work', 'time.')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
only fragments of time with my children

nor work in this way daily
 and time in the train

Having transitioned from leisure to work
Why isn’t the sun upIt’s time to wake up

your bid to the next highest ranked network
The long time I had a vision

I need the work
without the long time I was accounting

I walk up and don’t work anymore
The long time I was a vision

nor envy honest work
