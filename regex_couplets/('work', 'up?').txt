('work', 'up?')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

nor work in this way daily
The South Carolina primary 

Having transitioned from leisure to work
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

your bid to the next highest ranked network
the next network in your ranking

I need the work
though not many freeze up

I walk up and don’t work anymore
So I look up and don’t walk any

So I work and don’t look any
around my country 

nor envy honest work
was not just a defeat
