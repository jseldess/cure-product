('work', 'us')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

nor work in this way daily
was not just a defeat

Having transitioned from leisure to work
The ventillation rushes on

your bid to the next highest ranked network
So stay with us

I need the work
I want to cite a poem so usual

I walk up and don’t work anymore
it was not just a defeat

So I work and don’t look any
I have them trust in me

nor envy honest work
