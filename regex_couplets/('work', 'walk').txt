('work', 'walk')

Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?
Before we walk across the wide field

nor work in this way daily
there was no walking along the pleasure

I need the work
I walk up and don’t work anymore

So I work and don’t look any
walking into percents blending themselves

nor envy honest work
