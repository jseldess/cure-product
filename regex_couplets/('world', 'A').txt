('world', 'A')

off the edge of the world
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Which can be pronounced to the world
BREAK

The world 
Attributable or

off the end of the world
And as an extension of the values

hauling off the end of the world
All that I can think I want

the opinions in my world
CONTRACT
