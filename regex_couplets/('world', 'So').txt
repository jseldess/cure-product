('world', 'so')

off the edge of the world
reasons resources

Which can be pronounced to the world
You can hear it also through your leisure

The world 
I want to cite a poem so usual

off the end of the world
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

hauling off the end of the world
If I take some different measure

falling off the end of the world
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

the opinions in my world
for not paying sound overwhelmed
