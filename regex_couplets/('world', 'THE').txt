('world', 'THE')

off the edge of the world
THE SNOW

Which can be pronounced to the world
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

The world 
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

off the end of the world
THE OFFERS

hauling off the end of the world
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

the opinions in my world
