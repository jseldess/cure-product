('world', 'There')

off the edge of the world
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Which can be pronounced to the world
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

The world 
There was very little physical activity

off the end of the world
There are spots waiting

the opinions in my world
There are constant ways
