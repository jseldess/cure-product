('world', 'To')

off the edge of the world
To my children Walt Whitman

Which can be pronounced to the world
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

The world 
To neither study

off the end of the world
Tomorrow

falling off the end of the world
Toward the start informally given my reasons

the opinions in my world
To the ends of transactions
