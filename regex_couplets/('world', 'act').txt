('world', 'act')

off the edge of the world
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Which can be pronounced to the world
I was enjoined to act again

off the end of the world
I am bid to act again

hauling off the end of the world
actually considering the end

the opinions in my world
the ends of my transactions
