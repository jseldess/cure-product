('world', 'but')

off the edge of the world
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

Which can be pronounced to the world
Attributable or

off the end of the world
but it continued

hauling off the end of the world
but they are black spots

falling off the end of the world
but I can hear them

the opinions in my world
that decisions can be attributable
