('world', 'count')

off the edge of the world
Then I constellate my time family country

Which can be pronounced to the world
So I constellate the time family country

The world 
I brought my count down

off the end of the world
without the long time I was accounting

hauling off the end of the world
the simple act of honoring an accountant

the opinions in my world
