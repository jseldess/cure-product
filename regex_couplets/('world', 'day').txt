('world', 'day')

off the edge of the world
On a snow day with my children

Which can be pronounced to the world
I argued the days felt longer

off the end of the world
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

hauling off the end of the world
The day

the opinions in my world
at least most days
