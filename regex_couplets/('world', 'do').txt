('world', 'do')

off the edge of the world
in a sharp downward turn 

Which can be pronounced to the world
The dogs and lillies

The world 
I brought my head down

off the end of the world
What I do in my liesure

hauling off the end of the world
I walk up and don’t work anymore

the opinions in my world
latency which doesn’t mean anything
