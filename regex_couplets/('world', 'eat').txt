('world', 'eat')

off the edge of the world
too sunny to eat ice cream

Which can be pronounced to the world
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

The world 
was not just a defeat

off the end of the world
of the habits they create.

hauling off the end of the world
it was not just a defeat

the opinions in my world
for the creation of the universe
