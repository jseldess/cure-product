('world', 'ending')

off the edge of the world
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Which can be pronounced to the world
I tried to feel the key values extending 

off the end of the world
talking into pheasants bending themselves

hauling off the end of the world
talking into percents bending themselves

the opinions in my world
drawn formerly rights ending themselves
