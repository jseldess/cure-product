('world', 'fall')

off the edge of the world
Then fall then summer from my face

Which can be pronounced to the world
Then fall then summer

The world 
and not falling at all

off the end of the world
falling off the encoded end

hauling off the end of the world
I take it out in the snow fall

falling off the end of the world
The first falling syllable

the opinions in my world
