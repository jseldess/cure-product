('world', 'feel')

off the edge of the world
conversations with our feelings

Which can be pronounced to the world
I tried to feel the key values extending 

off the end of the world
I tried to feel the extension of key values

hauling off the end of the world
But my not feeling the memory aside

the opinions in my world
which feels most comfortable
