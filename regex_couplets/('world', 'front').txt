('world', 'front')

off the edge of the world
How can I appreciate the face in front of me

Which can be pronounced to the world
The leaves curdled on the tree out front

off the end of the world
in front of the set of regulations

hauling off the end of the world
And need out in front purchase

the opinions in my world
behind or out front or up above
