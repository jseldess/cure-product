('world', 'he')

off the edge of the world
Before we walk across the wide field

Which can be pronounced to the world
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

The world 
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

off the end of the world
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

hauling off the end of the world
The first language

falling off the end of the world
Then blue and sun again a second, then night

the opinions in my world
for not paying sound overwhelmed
