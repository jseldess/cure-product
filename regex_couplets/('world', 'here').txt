('world', 'here')

off the edge of the world
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

Which can be pronounced to the world
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

The world 
here described

off the end of the world
there was no promotion

hauling off the end of the world
Where I take my liesure

falling off the end of the world
there was no television to hear

the opinions in my world
Where in me did I host
