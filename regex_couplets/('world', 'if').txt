('world', 'if')

off the edge of the world
drifting away

Which can be pronounced to the world
if you have providence to excess

The world 
if he had not carried one virtue 

off the end of the world
That company creates a life

hauling off the end of the world
If I take a different measure

falling off the end of the world
If I take some different measure

the opinions in my world
if there is anything
