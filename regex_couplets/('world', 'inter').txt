('world', 'inter')

off the edge of the world
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Which can be pronounced to the world
hold at intervals riding forward

off the end of the world
with internally regulated climate

hauling off the end of the world
Then I saw them interview

the opinions in my world
my interfaced stand data
