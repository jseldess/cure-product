('world', 'live')

off the edge of the world
Which is a measure to never live out

Which can be pronounced to the world
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

The world 
Which is a pleasure to never live out

off the end of the world
where I send and relive aside

the opinions in my world
where I send and relive
