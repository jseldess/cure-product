('world', 'now')

off the edge of the world
On a snow day with my children

Which can be pronounced to the world
Right now I’m the cart

off the end of the world
I take it out in the snow fall

hauling off the end of the world
I even know what I would find

falling off the end of the world
I think I take it out into the snow fall that’s not sticking

the opinions in my world
who knows the way
