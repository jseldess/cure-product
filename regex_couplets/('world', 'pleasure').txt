('world', 'pleasure')

off the edge of the world
In any case, I hope it gives some pleasure, discomfort, questions, 

Which can be pronounced to the world
Which is a pleasure to never live out

The world 
there was no walking along the pleasure

off the end of the world
up in the television pleasure

the opinions in my world
