('world', 'stuff')

off the edge of the world
I hear it between bills and stuff

off the end of the world
I can hear it between bills and stuff

hauling off the end of the world
I can hear them between bills and stuff

falling off the end of the world
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

the opinions in my world
between bills and stuffed animals
