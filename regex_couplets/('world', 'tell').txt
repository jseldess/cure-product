('world', 'tell')

off the edge of the world
Then I constellate my time family country

Which can be pronounced to the world
So I constellate the time family country

The world 
I constellate the time

off the end of the world
I had to tell them the news

hauling off the end of the world
I tell you my purposes

the opinions in my world
and that man comes on to tell me
