('world', 'time.')

off the edge of the world
Then I constellate my time family country

Which can be pronounced to the world
So I constellate the time family country

The world 
 and time in the train

off the end of the world
The long time I had a vision

hauling off the end of the world
without the long time I was accounting

falling off the end of the world
The long time I was a vision

the opinions in my world
until a happier time found
