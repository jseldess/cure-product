('world', 'up?')

off the edge of the world
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

Which can be pronounced to the world
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

The world 
I want to cite a poem so usual

off the end of the world
The everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

hauling off the end of the world
The first language

falling off the end of the world
I reuse indelible tracks 

the opinions in my world
for not paying redundant
