('world', 'us')

off the edge of the world
asynchronous 

Which can be pronounced to the world
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

The world 
I want to cite a poem so usual

off the end of the world
So stay with us

hauling off the end of the world
I reuse indelible tracks

falling off the end of the world
I refuse indelible tracts

the opinions in my world
useless for not having paid
