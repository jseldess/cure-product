('world', 'use')

off the edge of the world
because it was really dark

Which can be pronounced to the world
You use the most essential parts

off the end of the world
I reuse unassimilable visions

hauling off the end of the world
I reuse indelible tracks

falling off the end of the world
I refuse indelible tracts

the opinions in my world
useless for not having paid
