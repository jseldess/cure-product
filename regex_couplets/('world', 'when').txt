('world', 'When')

off the edge of the world
When I woke up in the morning

Which can be pronounced to the world
When we had jobs that were to earn

The world 
When they really take hold of my finger

off the end of the world
When closed to my knowing

the opinions in my world
When I'm watching my tv
