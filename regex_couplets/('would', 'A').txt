('would', 'A')

over the long line I would honor
After having been contented

I would like your zip code
A turtle fished out of the lake

but would I love her the same
All that I can think I want

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
As a clone, illegally conceived

all parties would be held
And we could inhabit the room easy

people would be helped
More Companies Are Tracking Online Data, Study Finds

people would prevent
A baby and a bear

The constituents would be helped
All parties would be held for my own purchases

would only willingly break
CONTRACT
