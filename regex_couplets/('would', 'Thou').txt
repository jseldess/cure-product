('would', 'Thou')

over the long line I would honor
Thou marshallâ€™st me the way that I was going

I even know what I would find
Though in not many acts

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
Though we are waiting for her

all parties would be held
Though we are breaking 

would only willingly break
Though we are waiting
