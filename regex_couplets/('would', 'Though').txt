('would', 'though')

over the long line I would honor
though it was most emphatically that

I would like your zip code
I had nightmares though

but would I love her the same
though not many freeze up

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
I thought

all parties would be held
though we are still breaking in

The constituents would be helped
though we are breaking in the space that it had

where I send and relive would be held
after though thereâ€™s no memory
