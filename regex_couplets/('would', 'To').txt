('would', 'To')

over the long line I would honor
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

I would like your zip code
To that impossible place

but would I love her the same
Tomorrow

I even know what I would find
Toward the start informally given my reasons

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
To neither study

people would be helped
To the ends of transactions
