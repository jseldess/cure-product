('would', 'act')

over the long line I would honor
I was enjoined to act again

but would I love her the same
actually considering the end

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
we had inhabited actually

all parties would be held
to the ends of my transactions

people would be helped
The ends of my transactions

would only willingly break
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
