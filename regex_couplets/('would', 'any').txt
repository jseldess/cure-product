('would', 'any')

over the long line I would honor
Or the company

but would I love her the same
there wasn’t any television 

I even know what I would find
not many face up

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
or alter of course the time anyway

all parties would be held
if there is anything 

people would be helped
They have very many choices

people would prevent
latency which doesn’t mean anything
