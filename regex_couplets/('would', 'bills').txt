('would', 'bills')

over the long line I would honor
I hear it between bills and stuff

but would I love her the same
I can hear it between bills and stuff

What would I feel without that goal
I can hear them between bills and stuff

I even know what I would find
I cannot hear it between bills and stuff

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
between bills and stuffed animals
