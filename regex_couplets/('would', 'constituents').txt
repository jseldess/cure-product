('would', 'constituents')

over the long line I would honor
The constituents would be helped

all parties would be helped
The constituents 

all parties would be held
to constituents

would only willingly break
from my constituents

would only speak willingly
with latency from constituents

would speak willingly 
constituents

would only willingly speak
knowing the constituents
