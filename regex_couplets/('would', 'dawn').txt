('would', 'dawn')

over the long line I would honor
Forecasting the story before dawn

but would I love her the same
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
dawn already formerly nights 

people would be helped
dawn formerly

would only willingly break
with dawn already formerly nights 

all parties would be held
battery dawn nights
