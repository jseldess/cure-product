('would', 'do')

over the long line I would honor
The dogs and lillies

I would like your zip code
I brought my head down

but would I love her the same
What I do in my liesure

What would I feel without that goal
Undoubtedly 

I even know what I would find
I walk up and don’t work anymore

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
and it doesn’t take long

would only willingly break
latency which doesn’t mean anything

all parties would be held
I only think I don’t listen
