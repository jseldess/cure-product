('would', 'fall')

over the long line I would honor
Then fall then summer

I would like your zip code
and not falling at all

but would I love her the same
I take it out in the snow fall

What would I feel without that goal
falling off the end

I even know what I would find
falling off the end of the world

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
