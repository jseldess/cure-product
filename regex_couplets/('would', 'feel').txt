('would', 'feel')

over the long line I would honor
I tried to feel the key values extending 

but would I love her the same
What would I feel without that goal

What would I feel without a goal
But my not feeling the memory aside

people would be helped
But my not feeling the memory inside

would only willingly break
which feels most comfortable

all parties would be held
which feels more comfortable
