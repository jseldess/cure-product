('would', 'form')

over the long line I would honor
Toward the start informally given my reasons

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
already formerly a long time

all parties would be held
dawn already formerly nights 

people would be helped
A way formerly like this one

The constituents would be helped
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

where I send and relive would be held
already formely a long time

would only willingly break
in the form filled offered in trust
