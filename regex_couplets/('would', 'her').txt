('would', 'her')

over the long line I would honor
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

I would like your zip code
Where official policy is to catch and release

but would I love her the same
Where I take my liesure

What would I feel without that goal
there was no promotion

I even know what I would find
On the other hand

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

all parties would be held
Though we are waiting for her

people would be helped
elsewhere my purposes

people would prevent
where I send and relive would be held

All parties would be held for my own purchases
where I send and relive aside

would only willingly break
Where in me did I host
