('would', 'now')

over the long line I would honor
out in the snow

I would like your zip code
Right now Iâ€™m the cart

but would I love her the same
I take it out in the snow fall

What would I feel without that goal
I even know what I would find

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
knowing the constituents

all parties would be held
who knows the way
