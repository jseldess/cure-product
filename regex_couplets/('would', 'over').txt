('would', 'over')

over the long line I would honor
over the time line I was on

I would like your zip code
hovering above standing water

but would I love her the same
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

all parties would be held
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

people would be helped
for not paying sound overwhelmed
