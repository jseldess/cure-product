('would', 'speak')

over the long line I would honor
not speaking

The constituents would be helped
without really speaking

where I send and relive would be held
I speak to them

would only willingly break
would only speak willingly

would speak willingly 
would speak willingly only

would only willingly speak
I speak to them my possessions

all parties would be held
I speak them of my possessions
