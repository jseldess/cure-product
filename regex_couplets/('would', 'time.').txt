('would', 'time.')

over the long line I would honor
over the time line I was on

I would like your zip code
I spend time online learning to code

but would I love her the same
The long time I had a vision

What would I feel without that goal
without the long time I was accounting

I even know what I would find
So I constellate the time family country

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
or alter of course the time anyway

all parties would be held
formerly a long time they were on

people would be helped
until a happier time found
