('would', 'tire')

over the long line I would honor
The entire everyday company conservatory orangery armory fluency sensory

but would I love her the same
until I could not tire 

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

all parties would be held
