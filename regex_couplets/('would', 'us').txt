('would', 'us')

over the long line I would honor
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

I would like your zip code
In a vertiginous dream

but would I love her the same
I reuse unassimilable visions

What would I feel without that goal
because there was no solid ground to continue along

I even know what I would find
I refuse indelible tracts

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

all parties would be held
I want to cite a poem so usual

people would be helped
The trackers on users

people would prevent
in the form filled offered in trust

would only willingly break
useless for not having paid
