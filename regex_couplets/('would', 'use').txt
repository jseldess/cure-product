('would', 'use')

over the long line I would honor
You use the most essential parts

but would I love her the same
I reuse unassimilable visions

What would I feel without that goal
because there was no solid ground to continue along

I even know what I would find
I refuse indelible tracts

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
trackers collecting data on users

people would be helped
The trackers on users

people would prevent
I send and retrieve aside the impuse

All parties would be held
useless for not having paid
