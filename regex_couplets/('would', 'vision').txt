('would', 'vision')

over the long line I would honor
I had me a vision

but would I love her the same
I reuse unassimilable visions

What would I feel without that goal
there wasnâ€™t any television 

I even know what I would find
I resume unassimilable visions

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
joined in my television
