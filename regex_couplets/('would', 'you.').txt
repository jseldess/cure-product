('would', 'you.')

over the long line I would honor
You can hear it also through your leisure

I would like your zip code
That you can see only the back of

but would I love her the same
where you can earn more 

I even know what I would find
If you have confidence regardless all else

Not even a [blank] would elect to be
I see you knitting uproars with a bow

all parties would be held
This is your voice 

people would be helped
the young ripples inaudibly
