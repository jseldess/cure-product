I suspend live connections to you
Arrayed out in such a nested way

I upend my connections to you
Ask who I am to suspend

I upend live connections to you
Ask who I am

I intend my live connections to you
Ask who I am to end my live connection

Suspended live in connections to you
A face and an interface. Exhaustion and saturation. 

Though how can you know without direction
And as an extension of the values

You can hear it also through your leisure
And make myself a visible

if you have providence to excess
BREAK

If you have confidence regardless all else
Attributable or

May I have your zip code
A turtle fished out of the lake

That you can see only the back of
Aspirational strategy

your bid to the next highest ranked network
ASPIRATING VISIONS

since you can imagine movement
As an extension of the values

that potential is there for you
All that I can think I want

Then I saw into you
COPY DREAM 

a futile joyous white sun
As a clone, illegally conceived

having been purchased out of you
Articles all around us

I tell you my purposes
And for an ungraspable time

I tell you the weight of my purchases
And reached up the screen

I tell you the weight of my purposes
SOCIAL

I tell you where I need gravity
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
And we could inhabit the room easy

This is your voice

The contours exchange with you
PRELUDE (FANTASY) IN A MINOR

the young ripples inaudibly
2 â€“ PREAMBLE

brought messageable to you
All that I own messageable
