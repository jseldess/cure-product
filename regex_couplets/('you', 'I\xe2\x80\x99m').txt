('You', 'I\xe2\x80\x99m')

You should ask who I am
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

You can hear it also through your leisure
Right now I’m the cart

You use the most essential parts
It’s as essential as physics, I’m told

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
where I’m watching my tv

You can have seen offering
