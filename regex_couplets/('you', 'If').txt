('You', 'if')

You should ask who I am
drifting away

You can hear it also through your leisure
drifting away needs others presume desires

You use the most essential parts
out of the fifth page ruins

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
If I take a different measure

You can hear it also through static leisure
If I take some different measure

You need history
if there is anything 

You can have seen offering
