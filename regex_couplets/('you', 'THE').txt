('You', 'THE')

You should ask who I am
THE SNOW

You can hear it also through your leisure
ON THE TRAIL OF A COUNTERFEITER CALLED ‘THE PRINTER’

You use the most essential parts
UPSENT IN THE AFTERNOON

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
FULL OF THE MISSING WORDS

You can have seen offering
THE OFFERS
