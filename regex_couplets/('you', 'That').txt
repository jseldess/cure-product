('You', 'That')

You should ask who I am
That’s exaclty what I want for them

You can hear it also through your leisure
That’s where I sleep at times

You use the most essential parts
That’s when they really take

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
That I captured an afterimage

You can have seen offering
