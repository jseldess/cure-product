('You', 'There')

You should ask who I am
Thereâ€™s really no need to be so concerned all the time

You can hear it also through your leisure
There are quarterly goals

You use the most essential parts
There was very little physical activity

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

You need history
There are spots waiting

You can have seen offering
