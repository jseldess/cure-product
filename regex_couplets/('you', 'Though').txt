('You', 'though')

You should ask who I am
As though stationary and a destination

You can hear it also through your leisure
though it was most emphatically that

You use the most essential parts
I had nightmares though

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
though it is not a simple act

You can clear it also through static seizure
I thought

You can have seen offering
