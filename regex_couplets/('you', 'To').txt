('You', 'To')

You should ask who I am
To my children Walt Whitman

You can hear it also through your leisure
To my chidren

You use the most essential parts
To that impossible place

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Toward the middle of the sixteenth century

You need history
To neither study

You can have seen offering
