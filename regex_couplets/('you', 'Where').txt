('you', 'Where')

I suspend live connections to you
Where I sleep at times

I upend my connections to you
Whereas direction is beside the point

I suspend my connections to you
Where official policy is to catch and release

That you can see only the back of
Where I take my liesure

where you can earn more 
Where I lead gravity

I tell you my purposes
Where I need gravity

I tell you the weight of my purposes
Where in me did I host

You can hear it also through your leisure
Where I host my purposes

This is your voice 
Where in me did I last

The contours exchange with you
