('you', 'You')

I suspend live connections to you
You should ask who I am

I upend live connections to you
You can hear it also through your leisure

bring your child along
You use the most essential parts

That you can see only the back of
You cannot clear it also through static pleasure

Then I saw into you
You need history

a futile joyous white sun
You can have seen offering
