('you', 'act')

I suspend live connections to you
variegated reflected retroactive reactive light

Though how can you know without direction
I was enjoined to act again myself

You can hear it also through your leisure
I was enjoined to act again

That you can see only the back of
Not goals or tactics

your bid to the next highest ranked network
and strategies not tactics

since you can imagine movement
There was very little physical activity

that potential is there for you
actually considering the end

Then I saw into you
we had inhabited actually

This is your voice 
The ends of my transactions

The contours exchange with you
to the ends of my transactions

the young ripples inaudibly
before I act on them

brought messageable to you
