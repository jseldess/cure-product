('you', 'agreed')

I suspend live connections to you
and to which I’ve agreed

You can hear it also through your leisure
and to which I’ve agreed already formerly

The contours exchange with you
that agreed one of rest

the young ripples inaudibly
that agreed home

brought messageable to you
that agreed to one the people

I offer to you
