('you', 'along')

I suspend live connections to you
bring your child along

You can hear it also through your leisure
The days lined along company

that potential is there for you
there was no walking along the pleasure

where you can earn more 
and continue along having 

Then I saw into you
formerly along time they were on

The contours exchange with you
formerly along my say to the elections

the young ripples inaudibly
