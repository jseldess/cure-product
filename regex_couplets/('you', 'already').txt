('you', 'already')

I suspend live connections to you
So I presume the offers already

brought messageable to you
already formerly a long time

You can hear it also through your leisure
and to which Iâ€™ve agreed already formerly

The contours exchange with you
already brought into privacy

I offer to you
for a while to listen already
