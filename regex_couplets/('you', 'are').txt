('you', 'are')

I suspend live connections to you
Though there are quarters goals

Though how can you know without direction
though there are quarters with goals

for how can you know without direction
who are so fresh and agile

You can hear it also through your leisure
barely outlines

That you can see only the back of
They are called aspirational

your bid to the next highest ranked network
The days are long

since you can imagine movement
I had nightmares though

that potential is there for you
but they are black spots

Then I saw into you
There are spots waiting

I tell you the weight of my purchases
Though we are waiting for her

This is your voice

The contours exchange with you
The many transparent pixel calls

the young ripples inaudibly
careening between the preambles
