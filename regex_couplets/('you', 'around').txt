('you', 'around')

I suspend live connections to you
Spinning around the heart

That you can see only the back of
around my country 

Then I saw into you
And the canyon spun around the dogs and lillies

having been purchased out of you
Articles all around us

I tell you my purposes
around the dogs and lillies

I tell you the weight of my purchases
More reasons around my country 

and elsewhere my memory of you
I stand and retrieve the impulse around

The contours exchange with you
and stand and retrieve and pulse around

the young ripples inaudibly
