('you', 'at')

I suspend live connections to you
But that is beside the point

I upend my connections to you
Where I sleep at times

I intend my connections to you
into rotating directionless 

I upend live connections to you
at home brought into privacy

brought messageable to you
by the private preambles

Though how can you know without direction
into rotating and directionless space

for how can you know without direction
not even rotating

You can hear it also through your leisure
But I can’t let myself treat 

bring your child along
What does it mean to drift

if you have providence to excess
the latter

If you have confidence regardless all else
was not just a defeat

May I have your zip code
and my heart rate

That you can see only the back of
What the next step

your bid to the next highest ranked network
They are called aspirational

since you can imagine movement
I argued that the days were longer

that potential is there for you
That company creates a life

where you can earn more 
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

Then I saw into you
attesting this is a chance

you need history
flattening my reception

a futile joyous white sun
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

having been purchased out of you
of those gathered

I tell you my purposes
And from that great distance

I tell you the weight of my purchases
I watch a movie

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
here is the site of the battle of maldon

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

This is your voice 
though it was most emphatically that

This is your choice 
trackers collecting data on users

The contours exchange with you
The way that I was going

the young ripples inaudibly
state kept owned impression

I offer to you
that this is possible
