('you', 'attributable')

I suspend live connections to you
I resume attributable visions

You can hear it also through your leisure
attributable visions

a futile joyous white sun
that decisions can be attributable

The contours exchange with you
decisions that can be attributable

brought messageable to you
revisions that can be attributable

I offer to you
forgetting decisions that can be attributable
