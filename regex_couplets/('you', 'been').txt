('you', 'been')

I suspend live connections to you
It has been since

You can hear it also through your leisure
After having been contented

if you have providence to excess
that having been after content

That you can see only the back of
having been graspable

a futile joyous white sun
having been an ungraspable time

having been purchased out of you
