('you', 'brought')

I suspend live connections to you
at home brought into privacy

brought messageable to you
I brought my head down

That you can see only the back of
own stays brought loyal

The contours exchange with you
own that stays brought loyal

the young ripples inaudibly
already brought into privacy

I offer to you
brought messageable into privacy
