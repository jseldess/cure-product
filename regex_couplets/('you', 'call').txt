('You', 'call')

You should ask who I am
not calling or echoing for once

You can hear it also through your leisure
though it was most emphatically that

You use the most essential parts
They are called aspirational

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Which can be called confidence

You need history
to take the call

You can have seen offering
