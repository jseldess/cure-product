('you', 'came')

I suspend live connections to you
I invited most of what came next

since you can imagine movement
I came back to me

a futile joyous white sun
I came after my past

having been purchased out of you
until the bill came

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
and came home to rewind inflections

brought messageable to you
and came home to rewind
