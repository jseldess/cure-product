('You', 'can\xe2\x80\x99t')

You should ask who I am
I can’t fix them without direction

You can hear it also through your leisure
and can’t presume to need

You use the most essential parts
That can’t be glimpsed

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
Though we can’t help waiting

You can have seen offering
