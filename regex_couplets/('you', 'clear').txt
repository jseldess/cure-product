('You', 'clear')

You should ask who I am
I cannot clear it also through divestiture

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I cannot clear it also through static pleasure

You can clear it also through static seizure
You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
You can clear it also through static siezure

You can hear it also through static leisure
You can clear it also through static leisure

You can hear it also through your leisure
