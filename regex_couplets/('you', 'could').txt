('you', 'could')

I suspend live connections to you
and could be mapped and weighed

That you can see only the back of
until I could not tire 

You can hear it also through your leisure
until I could not be tired

Then I saw into you
until I could not be hired

a futile joyous white sun
I could consume the dream

having been purchased out of you
I could in effect credit

I tell you my purposes
and we could inhabit the room easy

This is your voice 
and could be inflected with reasons

brought messageable to you
