('you', 'dawn')

I suspend live connections to you
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Though how can you know without direction
Forecasting the story before dawn

That you can see only the back of
dawn already formerly nights 

You can hear it also through your leisure
dawn formerly

The contours exchange with you
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

the young ripples inaudibly
