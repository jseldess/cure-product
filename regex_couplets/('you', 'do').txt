('You', 'do')

You should ask who I am
The dogs and lillies

You can hear it also through your leisure
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

You use the most essential parts
which I brought down with qualities

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
What I do in my liesure

You can hear it also through static leisure
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

You need history
here is the site of the battle of maldon

You can have seen offering
