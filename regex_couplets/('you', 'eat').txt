('You', 'eat')

You should ask who I am
too sunny to eat ice cream

You can hear it also through your leisure
But I canâ€™t let myself treat 

You use the most essential parts
executive breath

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
it was not just a defeat

You need history
And from that great distance

You can have seen offering
