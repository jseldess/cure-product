('you', 'edge')

I suspend live connections to you
I step off the edge

I upend my connections to you
off the edge of the world

Though how can you know without direction
I step over the edge

for how can you know without direction
If I step over the edge

You can hear it also through your leisure
Face falling off the edge of the face

if you have providence to excess
Falling off the edge of the face

That you can see only the back of
and testing the edge and gravity

your bid to the next highest ranked network
