('You', 'ending')

You should ask who I am
battery dawn nights blending themselves

You can hear it also through your leisure
I tried to feel the key values extending 

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
talking into pheasants bending themselves

You can hear it also through static leisure
talking into percents bending themselves

You can have seen offering
