('you', 'feel')

I suspend live connections to you
conversations with our feelings

Though how can you know without direction
does not feel an exception

You can hear it also through your leisure
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

bring your child along
I tried to feel the key values extending 

That you can see only the back of
I tried to feel the extension of key values

your bid to the next highest ranked network
when trying to feel the extension of key values

since you can imagine movement
What would I feel without that goal

where you can earn more 
But my not feeling the memory aside

The contours exchange with you
But my not feeling the memory inside

the young ripples inaudibly
