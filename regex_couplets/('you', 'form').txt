('you', 'form')

I suspend live connections to you
There are performance reviews

You can hear it also through your leisure
Toward the start informally given my reasons

Then I saw into you
already formerly a long time

This is your voice 
A way formerly like this one

The contours exchange with you
formerly a way

the young ripples inaudibly
own best form

brought messageable to you
own best form to ourselves

I offer to you
