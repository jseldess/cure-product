('you', 'get')

I suspend live connections to you
I’ll get there eventually

Though how can you know without direction
and is relentlessly budgeted

bring your child along
I’ll get there ruins

That you can see only the back of
I get through there

a futile joyous white sun
forgetting decisions 

The contours exchange with you
forgettable
