('you', 'going')

I suspend live connections to you
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Though how can you know without direction
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going

You can hear it also through your leisure
The way that she is going

The contours exchange with you
The way that I was going

the young ripples inaudibly
