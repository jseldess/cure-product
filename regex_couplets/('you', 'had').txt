('you', 'had')

I suspend live connections to you
If he had not carried one virtue

if you have providence to excess
When we had jobs that were to earn

If you have confidence regardless all else
I had me a vision

That you can see only the back of
Since I had to hold the entire company

since you can imagine movement
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

that potential is there for you
I had to tell them the news

where you can earn more 
The long time I had a vision

You can hear it also through your leisure
I had a vision

a futile joyous white sun
we had to say goodbye

Having been purchased out of you
And we had to say goodbye to her there

I tell you my purposes
that nothing had gravity

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
we had inhabited actually

This is your voice 
in the face that I had

The contours exchange with you
I had entered my phone

the young ripples inaudibly
