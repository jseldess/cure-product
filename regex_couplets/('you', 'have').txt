('you', 'have')

I suspend live connections to you
Weâ€™ll have coffee this morning

I intend my live connections to you
I have entered my phone

Though how can you know without direction
if you have providence to excess

You can hear it also through your leisure
If you have confidence regardless all else

May I have your zip code
I have them lost

a futile joyous white sun
I have supporters

I tell you the weight of my purchases
I have a memory between the day

This is your voice 
I have entered my purposes

and elsewhere my memory of you
I have entered my purchases

Then I saw into you
if you have providence

The contours exchange with you
and have no way

the young ripples inaudibly
I have them trust in me

brought messageable to you
I have seen more than I can remember
