('You', 'he')

You should ask who I am
Whereas direction is beside the point

You can hear it also through your leisure
The dogs and lillies

You use the most essential parts
Even before the lesson starts

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
in the simple act of reading

You can clear it also through static seizure
The simple act opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
You can hear it also through static leisure

You can clear it also through static leisure
talking into pheasants bending themselves

You need history
The long time I had a vision

You can have seen offering
I assume possession to others
