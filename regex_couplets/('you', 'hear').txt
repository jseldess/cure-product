('you', 'hear')

I suspend live connections to you
You can hear it also through your leisure

bring your child along
and my heart rate

That you can see only the back of
I hear it between bills and stuff

since you can imagine movement
I can hear it between bills and stuff

where you can earn more 
that I can hear

Then I saw into you
In my heart did I lose trust

The contours exchange with you
