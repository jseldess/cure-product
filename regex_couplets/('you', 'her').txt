('you', 'her')

I suspend live connections to you
Where I sleep at times

I upend my connections to you
Whereas direction is beside the point

I suspend my connections to you
The prospects there already

brought messageable to you
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Though how can you know without direction
though there are quarters with goals

for how can you know without direction
what I find there

You can hear it also through your leisure
I’ll get there eventually

bring your child along
There are quarterly goals

if you have providence to excess
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

If you have confidence regardless all else
To neither study

May I have your zip code
Where official policy is to catch and release

That you can see only the back of
there was no promotion

since you can imagine movement
There was very little physical activity

that potential is there for you
but would I love her the same

where you can earn more 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

Then I saw into you
I get through there

a futile joyous white sun
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

having been purchased out of you
And we had to say goodbye to her there

I tell you my purposes
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I tell you the weight of my purchases
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

I tell you the weight of my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
here is the site of the battle of maldon

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
Though we are waiting for her

This is your voice 
To substitute neither study

and elsewhere my memory of you
where I send and relive aside

The contours exchange with you
to their other end

the young ripples inaudibly
The offers there already

I offer to you
traffick is there nonetheless
