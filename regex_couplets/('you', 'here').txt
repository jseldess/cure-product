('You', 'here')

You should ask who I am
Whereas direction is beside the point

You can hear it also through your leisure
I’ll get there eventually

You use the most essential parts
I’ll get there ruins

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

You need history
I get through there

You can have seen offering
