('you', 'hold')

I suspend live connections to you
I take hold of my finger

if you have providence to excess
When they really take hold of my finger

That you can see only the back of
Since I had to hold the entire company

since you can imagine movement
Since I had to hold the entire crew captive

that potential is there for you
and hold and wish to hold

a futile joyous white sun
designed to hold up my underwear

I tell you my purposes
