('you', 'isn\xe2\x80\x99t')

I suspend live connections to you
The sun isn’t up 

I upend my connections to you
No! It’s morning, but the sun isn’t up yet.

Though how can you know without direction
Then the sun isn’t available

You can hear it also through your leisure
Then the sun isn’t up

if you have providence to excess
but the sun isn’t up

That you can see only the back of
