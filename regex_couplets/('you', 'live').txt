('you', 'live')

I suspend live connections to you
I upend live connections to you

I intend my connections to you
I am to end my connections suspended live

I upend my connections to you
I intend my live connections to you

My live connections to you
Ask who I am to end my live connection

Suspended live in connections to you
Which is a measure to never live out

bring your child along
There lived on the banks of the Havel a horse dealer

You can hear it also through your leisure
Which is a pleasure to never live out

if you have providence to excess
where I send and relive aside

The contours exchange with you
where I send and relive

the young ripples inaudibly
