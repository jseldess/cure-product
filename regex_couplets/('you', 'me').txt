('you', 'me')

I suspend live connections to you
Where I sleep at times

I upend my connections to you
I assumed it was visible

I upend live connections to you
into the minority proportion of time

brought messageable to you
Then I constellate my time family country

Though how can you know without direction
Then fall then summer

You can hear it also through your leisure
Which is a measure to never live out

bring your child along
What does it mean to drift

if you have providence to excess
So I constellate the time family country

If you have confidence regardless all else
 and time in the train

May I have your zip code
Some disease effecting the tree out front

That you can see only the back of
I had me a vision

since you can imagine movement
Since I can imagine movement

that potential is there for you
with full potential to movement

where you can earn more 
from home

Then I saw into you
The long time I had a vision

you need history
The long time I was a vision

a futile joyous white sun
I came after my past

having been purchased out of you
For an ungraspable time

I tell you my purposes
And for an ungraspable time

I tell you the weight of my purchases
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I tell you the weight of my purposes
I could consume the dream

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

This is your voice 
and elsewhere my memory of you

This is your chance
But my not feeling the memory aside

The contours exchange with you
But my not feeling the memory inside

the young ripples inaudibly
I have them trust in me

I offer to you
So I presume the offers already
