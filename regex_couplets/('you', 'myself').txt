('you', 'myself')

I suspend live connections to you
So I find myself at home

brought messageable to you
I’ll pull myself another personality type

Though how can you know without direction
But I can’t let myself treat 

bring your child along
I’ll pull myself a visible and invaluable partner

You can hear it also through your leisure
And make myself a visible

if you have providence to excess
I keep turning back again myself

That you can see only the back of
I was enjoined to act again myself

since you can imagine movement
off the end myself

that potential is there for you
myself

The contours exchange with you
the least productive of myself

the young ripples inaudibly
So I found myself at home

I offer to you
