('you', 'need')

I suspend live connections to you
There’s really no need to be so concerned all the time

Though how can you know without direction
and can’t presume to need

bring your child along
drifting away needs

You can hear it also through your leisure
I need the work

Then I saw into you
You need history

a futile joyous white sun
And need out in front purchase

Having been purchased out of you
where I need gravity

I tell you my purposes
I tell you where I need gravity

I tell you the weight of my purposes
not needing to wait

The contours exchange with you
in need one in that best own

the young ripples inaudibly
need one in best own

brought messageable to you
