('you', 'nights')

I suspend live connections to you
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Though how can you know without direction
dawn already formerly nights 

You can hear it also through your leisure
with dawn already formerly nights 

The contours exchange with you
I end up in Bach battery dawn nights

the young ripples inaudibly
