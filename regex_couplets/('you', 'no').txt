('you', 'no')

I suspend live connections to you
into the minority proportion of time

I upend my connections to you
Then I cannot see face value

Though how can you know without direction
Theyâ€™re just not mine

for how can you know without direction
not even rotating

You can hear it also through your leisure
But not to impart cynicism

bring your child along
the drifting is not something special

if you have providence to excess
which can be pronounced 

If you have confidence regardless all else
if he had not carried one virtue 

May I have your zip code
In a vertiginous dream

That you can see only the back of
an upsent afternoon

your bid to the next highest ranked network
and strategies not tactics

since you can imagine movement
there was no promotion

that potential is there for you
I take it out in the snow fall

where you can earn more 
because there was no solid ground to continue along

Then I saw into you
until I could not be tired

you need history
until I could not be hired

a futile joyous white sun
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

having been purchased out of you
I used my technology

I tell you my purposes
that nothing had gravity

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
The sun high enough to enter directly

This is your voice 
nor work in this way daily

This is your choice 
nor envy honest work

and elsewhere my memory of you
which we can pronounce

The contours exchange with you
with no constant ways 

the young ripples inaudibly
in that I cannot remember 

brought messageable to you
for a while not to listen
