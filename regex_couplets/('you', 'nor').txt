('You', 'nor')

You should ask who I am
into the minority proportion of time

You can hear it also through your leisure
over the long line I would honor

You use the most essential parts
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
nor work in this way daily

You can have seen offering
