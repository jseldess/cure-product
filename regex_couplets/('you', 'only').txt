('you', 'only')

I suspend live connections to you
only fragments of time with my children

Though how can you know without direction
only in the case

May I have your zip code
So that I notice I am the only one

That you can see only the back of
then I can see only the back values

your bid to the next highest ranked network
The planning process is for visionaries only

since you can imagine movement
would only willingly break

The contours exchange with you
if only on the way to the trash

I offer to you
I only think I donâ€™t listen
