('You', 'open')

You should ask who I am
Before we walk across the wide opening

You can hear it also through your leisure
my desires were open

You use the most essential parts
I wish my desires were open

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
The simple act opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static seizure
The simple act of opening surmounted

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
in the simple act of opening a book

You can clear it also through static pleasure seizure
