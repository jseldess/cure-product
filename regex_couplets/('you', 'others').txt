('you', 'others')

I suspend live connections to you
others desires

You can hear it also through your leisure
Then I can’t presume to need others

bring your child along
If I let myself see others desires

if you have providence to excess
I presume to others

The contours exchange with you
Cereal and others’ health

the young ripples inaudibly
I assume possession to others
