('you', 'over')

I suspend live connections to you
I step over the edge

for how can you know without direction
If I step over the edge

You can hear it also through your leisure
over the long time up in the sky

if you have providence to excess
hovering above standing water

That you can see only the back of
oddly grown over with historic bark

your bid to the next highest ranked network
over the roof of the buildings across the alley

Then I saw into you
over another on a coat of mail, and a chest made of steel

having been purchased out of you
cookies and other types of tracking technology found over time on the most visited sites.

The contours exchange with you
over the hooves and buildings across the alley
