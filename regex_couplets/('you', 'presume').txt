('you', 'presume')

I suspend live connections to you
So I presume the offers already

brought messageable to you
and can’t presume to need

bring your child along
Then I can’t presume to need others

You can hear it also through your leisure
I continue to presume

a futile joyous white sun
I presume to others

The contours exchange with you
I presume the offers

I offer to you
So I presume the offers
