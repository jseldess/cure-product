('you', 'prospect')

I suspend live connections to you
The prospects there already

brought messageable to you
the impulse for my own prospects

The contours exchange with you
stopping into the prospect

the young ripples inaudibly
speech that is of by prospects

I offer to you
The prospect for careening attached
