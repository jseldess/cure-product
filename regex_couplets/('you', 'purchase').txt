('you', 'purchase')

I suspend live connections to you
conversations with our purchase

Though how can you know without direction
in traversing my purchase

where you can earn more 
purchased out

having been purchased out of you
for an ungraspable purchase

I tell you my purposes
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I tell you the weight of my purposes
Is the weight of my purchases

I tell you where I need gravity
I have entered my purchases

Then I saw into you
the impulse for my own purchases

The contours exchange with you
converting sight into a purchase

the young ripples inaudibly
