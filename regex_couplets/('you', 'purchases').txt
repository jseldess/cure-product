('you', 'purchases')

I suspend live connections to you
I tell you the weight of my purchases

I tell you my purposes
Is the weight of my purchases

I tell you the weight of my purposes
I have entered my purchases

Then I saw into you
the impulse for my own purchases

The contours exchange with you
for my own purchases

the young ripples inaudibly
