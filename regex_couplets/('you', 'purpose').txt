('you', 'purpose')

I suspend live connections to you
by no ventillation my purpose

You can hear it also through your leisure
until my purpose up in the sky

That you can see only the back of
until I purpose the horizon

a futile joyous white sun
My purpose up in the sky

Having been purchased out of you
I tell you my purposes

I tell you the weight of my purchases
until I purpose up in the sky

I tell you the weight of my purposes
weight of my purposes

I tell you where I need gravity
Where I host my purposes

This is your voice 
I have entered my purposes

and elsewhere my memory of you
the impulse for my own purposes

The contours exchange with you
to the other end of my purpose

the young ripples inaudibly
