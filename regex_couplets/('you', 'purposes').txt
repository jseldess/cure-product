('you', 'purposes')

I suspend live connections to you
I tell you my purposes

I tell you the weight of my purchases
I tell you the weight of my purposes

I tell you where I need gravity
weight of my purposes

a futile joyous white sun
Where I host my purposes

This is your voice 
I have entered my purposes

and elsewhere my memory of you
the impulse for my own purposes

The contours exchange with you
for my own purposes

the young ripples inaudibly
