('you', 'really')

I suspend live connections to you
because it was really dark

Though how can you know without direction
When they really take hold of my finger

That you can see only the back of
without really agreeing

You can hear it also through your leisure
without really speaking

The contours exchange with you
also didnâ€™t really move

the young ripples inaudibly
