('You', 'resume')

You should ask who I am
So I presume the offers already

You can hear it also through your leisure
and canâ€™t presume to need

You use the most essential parts
I resume unassimilable visions

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I resume attributable visions

You can hear it also through static leisure
I continue to presume

You can have seen offering
I presume to others
