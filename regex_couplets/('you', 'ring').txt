('You', 'ring')

You should ask who I am
interferring 

You can hear it also through your leisure
bring your child along

You use the most essential parts
hovering above standing water

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
the simple act of honoring an accountant

You can clear it also through static pleasure liesure
predated by the clouds bordering the horizon

You can have seen offering
in school and can see offering
