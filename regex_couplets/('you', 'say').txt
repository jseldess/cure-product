('you', 'say')

I suspend live connections to you
we had to say goodbye

Having been purchased out of you
And we had to say goodbye to her there

I tell you my purposes
I ask say in that case

The contours exchange with you
formerly along my say to the elections

the young ripples inaudibly
We ask say in that case

brought messageable to you
I ask say in that phase decisioned

I offer to you
