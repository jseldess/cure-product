('You', 'should')

You should ask who I am
While I should be sleeping

You use the most essential parts
Looking back while I should be sleeping

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I click my zipcode up where it should be down

You can hear it also through your leisure
they should rise up

You can have seen offering
