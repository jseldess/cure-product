('you', 'sleep')

I suspend live connections to you
Where I sleep at times

I upend my connections to you
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then I’m going back to sleep, too.

Though how can you know without direction
That’s where I sleep at times

You can hear it also through your leisure
Interrupted sleep or

May I have your zip code
While I should be sleeping

That you can see only the back of
like flattening sleep 

a futile joyous white sun
