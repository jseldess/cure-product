('You', 'sleep.')

You should ask who I am
Where I sleep at times

You can hear it also through your leisure
Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times

You use the most essential parts
While I should be sleeping 

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
like flattening sleep 

You can have seen offering
