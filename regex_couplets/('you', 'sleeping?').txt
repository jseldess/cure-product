('You', 'sleeping?')

You should ask who I am
The sun is still sleeping? Well, then Iâ€™m going back to sleep, too.

You can hear it also through your leisure
While I should be sleeping

You use the most essential parts
Looking back while I should be sleeping

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
