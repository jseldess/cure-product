('you', 'step')

I suspend live connections to you
I step off the edge

I upend my connections to you
I step over the edge

for how can you know without direction
If I step over the edge

You can hear it also through your leisure
What the next step

That you can see only the back of
Whatâ€™s the next step

your bid to the next highest ranked network
from which to step off

that potential is there for you
step in by the prospect

The contours exchange with you
phase decision step in

the young ripples inaudibly
step by into the prospect

brought messageable to you
stepping in the middle

I offer to you
stepping off into the middle
