('You', 'story')

You should ask who I am
I told her a story, she drew waves.

You can hear it also through your leisure
Forecasting the story before dawn

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
as far back as my history heard

You can hear it also through static leisure
You need history

You can have seen offering
