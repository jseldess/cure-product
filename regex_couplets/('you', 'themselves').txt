('you', 'themselves')

I suspend live connections to you
battery dawn nights blending themselves

Though how can you know without direction
talking into pheasants bending themselves

where you can earn more 
talking into percents bending themselves

a futile joyous white sun
drawn formerly rights ending themselves

The contours exchange with you
dawn formerly rights ended themselves

the young ripples inaudibly
