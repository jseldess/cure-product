('You', 'time.')

You should ask who I am
Where I sleep at times

You can hear it also through your leisure
at any time it can drift again

You use the most essential parts
On the timeline I was on

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
The long time I had a vision

You can hear it also through static leisure
without the long time I was accounting

You need history
The long time I was a vision

You can have seen offering
