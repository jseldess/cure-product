('you', 'until')

I suspend live connections to you
until my purpose up in the sky

You can hear it also through your leisure
until I could not tire 

Then I saw into you
until I could not be tired

you need history
until I could not be hired

a futile joyous white sun
until I purpose up in the sky

I tell you the weight of my purchases
until I purchase up the sky

I tell you my purposes
until I purchase the sky

I tell you the weight of my purposes
until the bill came

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
until a happier time found

The contours exchange with you
