('You', 'us')

You should ask who I am
I suspend live connections to you

You can hear it also through your leisure
was not just a defeat for Mitt Romney

You use the most essential parts
in a continuous vertiginous dream

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I want to cite a poem so usual

You need history
I have them trust in me

You can have seen offering
