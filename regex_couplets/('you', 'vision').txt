('you', 'vision')

I suspend live connections to you
I had me a vision

That you can see only the back of
The planning process for visions

your bid to the next highest ranked network
The planning process is for visionaries only

since you can imagine movement
aspirating with visions

that potential is there for you
aspirating with little visions

where you can earn more 
there wasnâ€™t any television 

You can hear it also through your leisure
I resume attributable visions

Then I saw into you
The long time I had a vision

you need history
The long time I was a vision

a futile joyous white sun
cells, the movement of cells and the division of cells

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
joined in my television

the young ripples inaudibly
visions that can be attainable

brought messageable to you
revisions that can be attributable

I offer to you
