('you', 'waiting')

I suspend live connections to you
There are spots waiting

I tell you the weight of my purchases
Though we are waiting for her

You can hear it also through your leisure
Though we are waiting 

The contours exchange with you
waiting out front or up above 

the young ripples inaudibly
