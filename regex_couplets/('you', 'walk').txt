('You', 'walk')

You should ask who I am
Before we walk across the wide field

You can hear it also through your leisure
there was no walking along the pleasure

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

You need history
walking into percents blending themselves

You can have seen offering
