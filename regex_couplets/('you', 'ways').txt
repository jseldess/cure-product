('you', 'ways')

I suspend live connections to you
 wonder about all the ways we connect. 

Though how can you know without direction
always watching

a futile joyous white sun
deep into pathways from repeated travels

The contours exchange with you
with no constant ways 

the young ripples inaudibly
