('you', 'were')

I suspend live connections to you
When we had jobs that were to earn

if you have providence to excess
my desires were open

That you can see only the back of
I argued the days were longer

since you can imagine movement
The days were long

that potential is there for you
The days were long aligned

where you can earn more 
they were on

a futile joyous white sun
These were not glorious retirement sunsets of stocks and bonds

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
formerly a long time they were on

You can hear it also through your leisure
answered about 

The contours exchange with you
I answered what I thought

the young ripples inaudibly
that they were visible

brought messageable to you
that they were divisible
