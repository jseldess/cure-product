('You', 'When')

You should ask who I am
When I woke up in the morning

You can hear it also through your leisure
When we had jobs that were to earn

You use the most essential parts
When they really take hold of my finger

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
When closed to my knowing

You can have seen offering
