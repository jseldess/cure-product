('You', 'work')

You should ask who I am
Why and how do I come to keep that work and this separate?

You can hear it also through your leisure
nor work in this way daily

You use the most essential parts
Having transitioned from leisure to work

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
I walk up and donâ€™t work anymore

You need history
nor envy honest work

You can have seen offering
