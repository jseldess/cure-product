('you', 'world')

I suspend live connections to you
off the edge of the world

Though how can you know without direction
Which can be pronounced to the world

You can hear it also through your leisure
The world 

if you have providence to excess
off the end of the world

since you can imagine movement
hauling off the end of the world

Then I saw into you
the opinions in my world

The contours exchange with you
