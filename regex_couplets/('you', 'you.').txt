('You', 'you.')

You should ask who I am
Though how can you know without direction

You can hear it also through your leisure
bring your child along

You use the most essential parts
That you can see only the back of

You cannot clear it also through static pleasure
If you have confidence regardless all else

You need history
a futile joyous white sun

You can have seen offering
