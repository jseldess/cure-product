('you.', 'bill')

Though how can you know without direction
I hear it between bills and stuff

That you can see only the back of
I can hear it between bills and stuff

where you can earn more 
I can hear them between bills and stuff

You can hear it also through your leisure
billowing in the cloud

a futile joyous white sun
until the bill came

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
the bill my detuning 

the young ripples inaudibly
between bills and stuffed animals
