('you.', 'count')

Though how can you know without direction
Then I constellate my time family country

bring your child along
So I constellate the time family country

You can hear it also through your leisure
I brought my count down

That you can see only the back of
without the long time I was accounting

where you can earn more 
the simple act of honoring an accountant

If you have confidence regardless all else
without the long time I was on accounting

a futile joyous white sun
More reasons around my country 

This is your chance
