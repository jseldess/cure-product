('you.', 'earn')

Though how can you know without direction
When we had jobs that were to earn

if you have providence to excess
I spend time online learning to code

That you can see only the back of
where you can earn more 

You can hear it also through your leisure
decisioned to learn 

the young ripples inaudibly
decisioned to learn back
