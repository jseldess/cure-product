('you.', 'else')

Though how can you know without direction
If you have confidence regardless all else

May I have your zip code
Or in some imaginary elsewhere

I tell you my purposes
and elsewhere my memory

This is your voice 
and elsewhere my memory of you

This is your chance
elsewhere my purposes

the young ripples inaudibly
