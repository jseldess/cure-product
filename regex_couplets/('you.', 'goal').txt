('you.', 'goal')

Though how can you know without direction
With goals 

for how can you know without direction
and without quartely goals

bring your child along
There are quarterly goals

You can hear it also through your leisure
before morning goals

That you can see only the back of
Not goals or tactics

your bid to the next highest ranked network
not goals

since you can imagine movement
What would I feel without that goal

where you can earn more
