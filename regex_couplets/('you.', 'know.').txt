('you.', 'know.')

Though how can you know without direction
for how can you know without direction

You can hear it also through your leisure
I even know what I would find

If you have confidence regardless all else
even when close to my knowing

a futile joyous white sun
knowing the constituents

the young ripples inaudibly
