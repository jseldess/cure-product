('you.', 'man')

Though how can you know without direction
as pure as my children Walt Whitman

You can hear it also through your leisure
To my children Walt Whitman

bring your child along
Walt Whitman drifted

if you have providence to excess
not many face up

If you have confidence regardless all else
that of the man with the dyed blond hair

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
They have very many choices

the young ripples inaudibly
