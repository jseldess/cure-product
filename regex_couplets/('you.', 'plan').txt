('you.', 'plan')

Though how can you know without direction
and is relentlessly planned

bring your child along
The planning process for visions

That you can see only the back of
The planning process is for visionaries only

your bid to the next highest ranked network
and for which the plan agreed

the young ripples inaudibly
