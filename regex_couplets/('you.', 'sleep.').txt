('you.', 'sleep.')

Though how can you know without direction
where I sleep at times

bring your child along
Thatâ€™s where I sleep at times

You can hear it also through your leisure
Interrupted sleep or

May I have your zip code
While I should be sleeping

That you can see only the back of
like flattening sleep 

a futile joyous white sun
