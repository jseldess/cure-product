('you.', 'up?')

Though how can you know without direction
though there are quarters with goals

for how can you know without direction
slow asynchronous

You can hear it also through your leisure
Iâ€™ll get there eventually

bring your child along
without imparting the cynicism

if you have providence to excess
which can be pronounced 

If you have confidence regardless all else
upset by Gingrich

May I have your zip code
I would like your zip code

That you can see only the back of
an upsent afternoon

your bid to the next highest ranked network
the next network in your ranking

since you can imagine movement
I argued that the days were longer

where you can earn more 
and continue along having 

you need history
until I could not be tired

a futile joyous white sun
I shivered looking up

I see you knitting uproars with a bow
black spots on a white surface

I tell you my purposes
And for an ungraspable time

I tell you the weight of my purchases
until I purpose up in the sky

I tell you the weight of my purposes
weight of my purposes

I tell you where I need gravity
Is the weight of my purchases

some sort of a futile joyous white sun
Not even a [blank] would elect to be

This is your voice 
To neither study

This is your choice 
To substitute neither study

This is your chance
if you have providence

the young ripples inaudibly
I have them trust in me
