('your', 'For')

You can hear it also through your leisure
For whom drifting does not feel an exception

bring your child along
Forecasting the story before dawn

your bid to the next highest ranked network
For an ungraspable time

This is your voice 
For Mitt Romney

This is your choice 
For my own purchases
