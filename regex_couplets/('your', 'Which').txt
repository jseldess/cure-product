('your', 'Which')

You can hear it also through your leisure
Which is a measure to never live out

bring your child along
Which can be pronounced to the world

May I have your zip code
Which is a pleasure to never live out

This is your voice 
Which can be called confidence

This is your chance
Which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
