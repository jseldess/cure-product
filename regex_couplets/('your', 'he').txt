('your', 'he')

You can hear it also through your leisure
The dogs and lillies

bring your child along
without imparting the cynicism

May I have your zip code
Then I cannot see face value

your bid to the next highest ranked network
the next network in your ranking

This is your voice 
To neither study

This is your choice 
To substitute neither study

This is your chance
I send and retrieve the impulse
