('your', 'if')

You can hear it also through your leisure
drifting away needs others presume desires

bring your child along
What does it mean to drift

May I have your zip code
out of the fifth page ruins

your bid to the next highest ranked network
That company creates a life

This is your voice 
if you have providence
