('your', 'tell')

You can hear it also through your leisure
Then I constellate my time family country

bring your child along
So I constellate the time family country

May I have your zip code
The CEO tells me to embody values

your bid to the next highest ranked network
I had to tell them the news

This is your voice 
and that man comes on to tell me
